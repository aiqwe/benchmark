                "Malta (;), officially known as the Republic of Malta (), is a Southern European island country consisting of an archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea. It lies 80 km south of Italy, 284 km east of Tunisia, and 333 km north of Libya. The country covers just over 316 km2, with a population of just under 450,000 (despite an extensive emigration programme since the Second World War), making it one of the world's smallest    and most densely populated countries. The capital of Malta is Valletta, which at 0.8 km2, is the smallest national capital in the European Union.  Malta has two official languages: Maltese and English.\n\nMalta's location has historically given it great strategic importance as a naval base, and a succession of powers, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Moors, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, Knights of St. John, French and British, have ruled the islands.\n\nKing George VI of the United Kingdom awarded the George Cross to Malta in 1942 for the country's bravery in the Second World War.  The George Cross continues to appear on Malta's national flag.  Under the Malta Independence Act, passed by the British Parliament in 1964, Malta gained independence from the United Kingdom as an independent sovereign Commonwealth realm, officially known from 1964 to 1974 as the State of Malta, with Elizabeth II as its head of state.  The country became a republic in 1974, and although no longer a Commonwealth realm, remains a current member state of the Commonwealth of Nations. Malta was admitted to the United Nations in 1964 and to the European Union in 2004; in 2008, it became part of the Eurozone.\n\nMalta has a long Christian legacy and its Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta is claimed to be an apostolic see because, according to the Acts of the Apostles,  Paul the Apostle was shipwrecked on Malta.  Catholicism is the official religion in Malta. \n\nMalta is a popular tourist destination with its warm climate, numerous recreational areas, and architectural and historical monuments, including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum,  Valletta,  and seven Megalithic Temples, which are some of the oldest free-standing structures in the world.  \n\nEtymology\n\nThe origin of the term Malta is uncertain, and the modern-day variation derives from the Maltese language. The most common etymology is that the word Malta derives from the Greek word , meli, \"honey\".  The ancient Greeks called the island  (Melitē) meaning \"honey-sweet\" (which was also, inter alia, the name of a Nereid ), possibly due to Malta's unique production of honey; an endemic species of bee lives on the island. The Romans went on to call the island Melita, which can be considered either as a latinisation of the Greek  or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word . \n\nAnother conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth \"a haven\"  or \"port\"  in reference to Malta's many bays and coves. Few other etymological mentions appear in classical literature, with the term Malta appearing in its present form in the Antonine Itinerary (Itin. Marit. p. 518; Sil. Ital. xiv. 251). \n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory\n\nPottery found by archaeologists at the Skorba Temples resembles that found in Italy, and suggests that the Maltese islands were first settled in 5200 BCE mainly by Stone Age hunters or farmers who had arrived from the Italian island of Sicily, possibly the Sicani. The extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on Malta.  Prehistoric farming settlements dating to Early Neolithic period were discovered in open areas and also in caves, such as Għar Dalam. \n\nThe Sicani were the only tribe known to have inhabited the island at this time   and are generally regarded as being closely related to the Iberians.  The population on Malta grew cereals, raised livestock and, in common with other ancient Mediterranean cultures, worshiped a fertility figure represented in Maltese prehistoric artefacts exhibiting the proportions seen in similar statuettes, including the Venus of Willendorf.\n\nPottery from the Għar Dalam phase is similar to pottery found in Agrigento, Sicily. A culture of megalithis temple builders then either supplanted or arose from this early period. Around the time of 3500 BC, these people built some of the oldest existing free-standing structures in the world in the form of the megalithic Ġgantija temples on Gozo; other early temples include those at Ħaġar Qim and Mnajdra.Daniel Cilia, Malta Before History (2004: Miranda Publishers) ISBN 9990985081  \n\nThe temples have distinctive architecture, typically a complex trefoil design, and were used from 4000 to 2500 BCE. Animal bones and a knife found behind a removable altar stone suggest that temple rituals included animal sacrifice. Tentative information suggests that the sacrifices were made to the goddess of fertility, whose statue is now in the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta.  The culture apparently disappeared from the Maltese Islands around 2500 BC. Archaeologists speculate that the temple builders fell victim to famine or disease, but this is not certain.\n\nAnother interesting archaeological feature of the Maltese islands often attributed to these ancient builders, are equidistant uniform grooves dubbed \"cart tracks\" or \"cart ruts\" which can be found in several locations throughout the islands with the most prominent being those found in Misraħ Għar il-Kbir, which is informally known as \"Clapham Junction\". These may have been caused by wooden-wheeled carts eroding soft limestone.  \n\nAfter 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta.  In most cases there are small chambers here, with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found in the largest island of the Mediterranean sea.\n\nGreeks, Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans\n\nPhoenician traders,  who used the islands as a stop on their trade routes from the eastern Mediterranean to Cornwall, joined the natives on the island.  The Phoenicians inhabited the area now known as Mdina, and its surrounding town of Rabat, which they called Maleth.    The Romans, who also much later inhabited Mdina, referred to it (and the island) as Melita. \n\nAfter the fall of Phoenicia in 332 BC, the area came under the control of Carthage, a former Phoenician colony.  During this time the people on Malta mainly cultivated olives and carob and produced textiles.\n\nDuring the First Punic War, the island was conquered after harsh fighting by Marcus Atilius Regulus. After the failure of his expedition, the island fell back in the hands of Carthage, only to be conquered again in 218 BC, during the Second Punic War, by Roman Consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus. Since then, Malta became Foederata Civitas, a designation that meant it was exempt from paying tribute or the rule of Roman law, and fell within the jurisdiction of the province of Sicily. Punic influence, however, remained vibrant on the islands with the famous Cippi of Melqart, pivotal in deciphering the Punic language, dedicated in the 2nd century BC.   Also the local Roman coinage, which ceased in the first century BC,  indicates the slow pace of the island's Romanization, since the very last locally minted coins still bear inscriptions in Ancient Greek on the obverse (like \"MEΛΙΤΑΙΩ\", meaning \"of the Maltese\") and Punic motives, showing the resistance of the Greek and Punic cultures. \n\nIn the 1st century BC, Roman Senator and orator Cicero commented on the importance of the Temple of Juno, and on the extravagant behaviour of the Roman governor of Sicily, Verres. During the 1st century BC the island was mentioned by Pliny the Elder and Diodorus Siculus: the latter praised its harbours, the wealth of its inhabitants, its lavishly decorated houses and the quality of its textile products. In 2nd century, Emperor Hadrian (r. 117–38) upgraded the status of Malta to municipium or free town: the island local affairs were administered by four quattuorviri iuri dicundo and a municipal senate, while a Roman procurator, living in Mdina, represented the proconsul of Sicily. In 58 AD, Paul the Apostle was washed up on the islands together with Luke the Evangelist after their ship was wrecked on the islands. Paul the Apostle remained on the islands three months, preaching the Christian faith, which has since thrived on Malta. Few archaeological relics survive in Malta today from the Roman period, the sole exception being the Roman Domus, just outside the walls of Mdina.\n\nIn 395, when the Roman Empire was divided for the last time at the death of Theodosius I, Malta, following Sicily, fell under the control of the Western Roman Empire.  During the Migration Period as the Western Roman Empire declined, Malta came under attack and was conquered or occupied a number of times. From 454 to 464 the islands was subdued by the Vandals, and after 464 by the Ostrogoths. In 533 Belisarius, on his way to conquer the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa, reunited the islands under Imperial (Eastern) rule. Little is known about the Byzantine rule in Malta: the island depended on the theme of Sicily and had Greek Governors and a small Greek garrison. While the bulk of population continued to be constituted by the old, Latinized dwellers, during this period its religious allegiance oscillated between the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Byzantine rule introduced Greek families to the Maltese collective.  Malta remained under the Byzantine Empire until 870, when it fell to the Arabs. \n\nMuslim period and the Middle Ages\n\nMalta became involved in the Muslim–Byzantine Wars, and the conquest of Malta is closely linked with that of Sicily that began in 827 after admiral Euphemius' betrayal of his fellow Byzantines, requesting that the Aghlabids invade the island. \nThe Muslim chronicler and geographer al-Himyari recounts that in 870 AD, following a violent struggle against the occupying Byzantines, the Muslim invaders, first led by Halaf al-Hadim, and later by Sawada ibn Muhammad,  looted and pillaged the island, destroying the most important buildings, and leaving it practically uninhabited until it was recolonised by the Muslims from Sicily in 1048–1049 AD. It is uncertain whether this new settlement took place as a consequence of demographic expansion in Sicily, as a result of a higher standard of living in Sicily (in which case the recolonisation may have taken place a few decades earlier), or as a result of civil war which broke out among Muslim rulers of Sicily in 1038. \nThe Muslims introduced new irrigation, some fruits and cotton and the Siculo-Arabic language was adopted on the island from Sicily: it would eventually evolve into the Maltese language. \n\nThe Christians on the island were allowed freedom of religion; they had to pay jizya, a tax for non-Muslims, but were exempt from the tax that Muslims had to pay (zakat). \n\nNorman conquest\n\nThe Normans captured Malta in 1091, as part of their conquest of Sicily.  The Norman leader, Roger I of Sicily, was welcomed by the native Christians. The notion that Count Roger I reportedly tore off a portion of his checkered red-and-white banner and presented it to the Maltese – forming the basis of the modern flag of Malta in gratitude for having fought on his behalf – is founded in myth. \n\nThe Norman period was productive; Malta became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Sicily which also covered the island of Sicily and the southern half of the Italian Peninsula. The Catholic Church was reinstated as the state religion with Malta under the See of Palermo, and some Norman architecture sprung up around Malta especially in its ancient capital Mdina. Tancred, King of Sicily, the last Norman monarch, made Malta a fief of the kingdom and installed a count of Malta. As the islands were much desired due to their strategic importance, it was during this time the men of Malta were militarised to fend off capture attempts; early counts were skilled Genoese privateers.\n\nThe kingdom passed on to the dynasty of Hohenstaufen from 1194 until 1266. During this period, when Frederick II of Hohenstaufen began to reorganise his Sicilian kingdom, Western culture and religion began to exert their influence more intensely. \nMalta formed part of the Holy Roman Empire for 72 years. Malta was declared a county and a marquisate, but its trade was totally ruined. For a long time it remained solely a fortified garrison. \n\nA mass expulsion of Arabs occurred in 1224 and the entire Christian male population of Celano in Abruzzo was deported to Malta in the same year.  In 1249 Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, decreed that all remaining Muslims be expelled from Malta  or impelled to convert  \n\nFor a brief period the kingdom passed to the Capetian House of Anjou, but high taxes made the dynasty unpopular in Malta, due in part to Charles of Anjou's war against the Republic of Genoa, and the island of Gozo was sacked in 1275. A large revolt on Sicily known as the Sicilian Vespers followed these attacks, that saw the Peninsula separating into the Kingdom of Naples.\n\nCrown of Aragon rule and the Knights of Malta\n\nMalta was ruled by the House of Barcelona, an Aragonese dynasty from 1282 to 1409,\n with the Aragonese aiding the Maltese insurgents in the Sicilian Vespers in a naval battle in Grand Harbour in 1283.\n\nRelatives of the kings of Aragon ruled the island until 1409, when it formally passed to the Crown of Aragon. Early on in the Aragonese ascendancy, the sons of the monarchy received the title, \"Count of Malta\". During this time much of the local nobility was created. However, by 1397 the bearing of the title \"Count of Malta\" reverted to a feudal basis with two families fighting over the distinction, which caused some conflict. This led the Martin I of Sicily to abolish the title. Dispute over the title returned when the title was reinstated a few years later and the Maltese, led by the local nobility, rose up against Count Gonsalvo Monroy. Although they opposed the Count, the Maltese voiced their loyalty to the Sicilian Crown, which so impressed Alfonso V of Aragon that he did not punish the people for their rebellion. Instead, he promised never to grant the title to a third party, and incorporated it back into the crown. The city of Mdina was given the title of Città Notabile as a result of this sequence of events.\n\nOn 23 March 1530,  Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, gave the islands to the Knights Hospitaller under the leadership of Frenchman Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Grand Master of the Order,   in perpetual lease for which they had to pay an annual tribute of one single Maltese Falcon.         These knights, a military religious order now known as the Knights of Malta, had been driven out of Rhodes by the Ottoman Empire in 1522.\n\nIn 1551, the population of the island of Gozo (around 5,000 people) were taken as slaves by Barbary pirates and brought to the Barbary Coast in present-day Libya.\n\nThe knights, led by Frenchman Jean Parisot de Valette, Grand Master of the Order, withstood the Great Siege of Malta by the Ottomans in 1565. The knights, with the help of Spanish and Maltese forces, were victorious and repelled the attack. Speaking of the battle Voltaire said, \"Nothing is better known than the siege of Malta.\"   After the siege they decided to increase Malta's fortifications, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of Valletta, named in honour of Valette, was built. They also established watchtowers along the coasts – the Wignacourt, Lascaris and De Redin towers – named after the Grand Masters who ordered the work. The Knights' presence on the island saw the completion of many architectural and cultural projects, including the embellishment of Città Vittoriosa (modern Birgu), the construction of new cities including Città Rohan (modern Żebbuġ) and Città Hompesch (modern Żabbar) and the introduction of new academic and social resources. Approximately 11,000 people out of a population of 60,000 died of plague in 1675. \n\nFrench period\n\nThe Knights' reign ended when Napoleon captured Malta on his way to Egypt during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1798. Over the years preceding Napoleon's capture of the islands, the power of the Knights had declined and the Order had become unpopular. This was around the time when the universal values of freedom and liberty were incarnated by the French Revolution. People from both inside the Order and outside appealed to Napoleon Bonaparte to oust the Knights. Napoleon Bonaparte did not hesitate. His fleet arrived in 1798, en route to his expedition of Egypt. As a ruse towards the Knights, Napoleon asked for safe harbour to resupply his ships, and then turned his guns against his hosts once safely inside Valletta. Grand Master Hompesch capitulated, and Napoleon entered Malta.\n\nDuring 12–18 June 1798, Napoleon resided at the Palazzo Parisio in Valletta.    He reformed national administration with the creation of a Government Commission, twelve municipalities, a public finance administration, the abolition of all feudal rights and privileges, the abolition of slavery and the granting of freedom to all Turkish and Jewish slaves.  On the judicial level, a family code was framed and twelve judges were nominated. Public education was organised along principles laid down by Bonaparte himself, providing for primary and secondary education.  He then sailed for Egypt leaving a substantial garrison in Malta.\n\nThe French forces left behind became unpopular with the Maltese, due particularly to the French forces' hostility towards Catholicism and pillaging of local churches to fund Napoleon's war efforts. French financial and religious policies so angered the Maltese that they rebelled, forcing the French to depart. Great Britain, along with the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily, sent ammunition and aid to the Maltese and Britain also sent her navy, which blockaded the islands.\n\nGeneral Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois surrendered his French forces in 1800. Maltese leaders presented the island to Sir Alexander Ball, asking that the island become a British Dominion. The Maltese people created a Declaration of Rights in which they agreed to come \"under the protection and sovereignty of the King of the free people, His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". The Declaration also stated that \"his Majesty has no right to cede these Islands to any power...if he chooses to withdraw his protection, and abandon his sovereignty, the right of electing another sovereign, or of the governing of these Islands, belongs to us, the inhabitants and aborigines alone, and without control.\" \n\nBritish Empire and the Second World War\n\nIn 1814, as part of the Treaty of Paris,  Malta officially became a part of the British Empire and was used as a shipping way-station and fleet headquarters. After the Suez Canal opened in 1869, Malta's position halfway between the Strait of Gibraltar and Egypt proved to be its main asset, and it was considered an important stop on the way to India, a central trade route for the British. Because of its position, several culinary and botanical products were introduced in Malta; some examples (derived from the National Book of Trade Customs found in the National Library) include wheat (for bread making) and bacon.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1918, during the First World War, Malta became known as the Nurse of the Mediterranean due to the large number of wounded soldiers who were accommodated in Malta. \n\nIn 1919 British troops fired on a rally protesting against new taxes, killing four Maltese men. The event, known as Sette Giugno (Italian for 7 June), is commemorated every year and is one of five National Days.  \n\nBefore the Second World War, Valletta was the location of the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet's headquarters. However, despite Winston Churchill's objections, the command was moved to Alexandria, Egypt, in April 1937 fearing it was too susceptible to air attacks from Europe. \n\nDuring the Second World War, Malta played a very important role for the Allies; being a British colony, situated close to Sicily and the Axis shipping lanes, Malta was bombarded by the Italian and German air forces. Malta was used by the British to launch attacks on the Italian navy and had a submarine base. It was also used as a listening post, reading German radio messages including Enigma traffic. The bravery of the Maltese people during the second Siege of Malta moved King George VI to award the George Cross to Malta on a collective basis on 15 April 1942 \"to bear witness to a heroism and devotion that will long be famous in history\". Some historians argue that the award caused Britain to incur disproportionate losses in defending Malta, as British credibility would have suffered if Malta surrendered, as British forces in Singapore had done.  A depiction of the George Cross now appears in the upper hoist corner of the Flag of Malta. The collective award remained unique until April 1999, when the Royal Ulster Constabulary became the second - and, to date, the only other - recipient of a collective George Cross. \n\nIndependence and Republic\n\nMalta achieved its independence on 21 September 1964 (Independence Day) after intense negotiations with the United Kingdom, led by Maltese Prime Minister George Borġ Olivier. Under its 1964 constitution, Malta initially retained Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Malta and thus Head of State, with a Governor-General exercising executive authority on her behalf. In 1971, the Malta Labour Party led by Dom Mintoff won the General Elections, resulting in Malta declaring itself a republic on 13 December 1974 (Republic Day) within the Commonwealth, with the President as head of state. A defence agreement signed soon after independence (and re-negotiated in 1972) expired on 31 March 1979.\n\nMalta adopted a policy of neutrality in 1980.  In 1989, Malta was the venue of a summit between US President George H.W. Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, their first face-to-face encounter, which signalled the end of the Cold War. \n\nOn 16 July 1990, Malta, through its foreign minister, Guido de Marco, applied to join the European Union.  After tough negotiations, a referendum was held on 8 March 2003, which resulted in a favourable vote.  General Elections held on 12 April 2003, gave a clear mandate to the Prime Minister, Eddie Fenech Adami, to sign the Treaty of accession to the European Union on 16 April 2003 in Athens, Greece. \n\nMalta joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.  Following the European Council of 21–22 June 2007, Malta joined the eurozone on 1 January 2008. \n\nPolitics\n\nMalta is a republic  whose parliamentary system and public administration are closely modelled on the Westminster system. Malta had the second-highest voter turnout in the world (and the highest for nations without mandatory voting), based on election turnout in national lower house elections from 1960 to 1995.  The unicameral House of Representatives, (Maltese: Kamra tad-Deputati), is elected by direct universal suffrage through single transferable vote every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the President on advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nThe House of Representatives is made up of 69 members of parliament. However, where a party wins an absolute majority of votes, but does not have a majority of seats, that party is given additional seats to ensure a parliamentary majority. The Constitution of Malta provides that the president appoint as prime minister the member of the House who is best able to command a (governing) majority in the House.\n\nThe President of Malta is appointed for a five-year term by a resolution of the House of Representatives carried by a simple majority. The role of the president as head of state is largely ceremonial. The main political parties are the Nationalist Party, which is a Christian democratic party, and the Labour Party, which is a social democratic party. The Labour Party is currently at the helm of the government, the Prime Minister being Joseph Muscat. The Nationalist Party, with Simon Busuttil as its leader, is in opposition. There are a number of smaller political parties in Malta that presently have no parliamentary representation.\n\nUntil the Second World War, Maltese politics was dominated by the language question fought out by Italophile and Anglophile parties.[http://www.maltavoyager.com/history_independence.html Maltavoyager.com – History – The Independence] at www.maltavoyager.com Post-War politics dealt with constitutional questions on the relations with Britain (first with integration then independence) and, eventually, relations with the European Union.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nMalta has had a system of local government since 1993,  based on the European Charter of Local Self-Government. The country is divided into five regions, with each region having its own Regional Committee, serving as the intermediate level between local government and national government.  The regions are divided into local councils, of which there are currently 68 (54 in Malta and 14 in Gozo). Sixteen \"hamlets\", which form part of larger councils, have their own Administrative Committee. The six districts (five on the main island) serve primarily statistical purposes. \n\nEach council is made up of a number of councillors (from 5 to 13, depending on and relative to the population they represent). A mayor and a deputy mayor are elected by and from the councillors. The executive secretary, who is appointed by the council, is the executive, administrative and financial head of the council. Councillors are elected every four years through the single transferable vote. People who are eligible to vote in the election of the Maltese House of Representatives as well as resident citizens of the EU are eligible to vote. Due to system reforms, no elections were held before 2012. Since then, elections have been held every two years for an alternating half of the councils.\n\nLocal councils are responsible for the general upkeep and embellishment of the locality (including repairs to non-arterial roads), allocation of local wardens and refuse collection; they also carry out general administrative duties for the central government such as collection of government rents and funds and answer government-related public inquiries.\n\nForeign relations\n\nThe Republic of Malta has the following sister cities:\n\n*  Bainbridge Island, Washington\n\nIn addition, a number of individual cities, towns and villages in Malta have sister cities abroad: see List of twin towns and sister cities in Malta\n\nAside from this, Malta, as a member of the European Union, has bilateral relations with most of Europe. The country's bilateral relations in other continents are very limited, with some having non-existent bilateral relations. Japan, Philippines and Australia have expressed cooperation with Malta for future bilateral relations.\n\nMilitary\n\nThe objectives of the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) are to maintain a military organisation with the primary aim of defending the islands' integrity according to the defence roles as set by the government in an efficient and cost-effective manner. This is achieved by emphasising the maintenance of Malta's territorial waters and airspace integrity.\n\nThe AFM also engages in combating terrorism, fighting against illicit drug trafficking, conducting anti-illegal immigrant operations and patrols and anti-illegal fishing operations, operating search and rescue (SAR) services, and physical/electronic security/surveillance of sensitive locations. Malta's search-and-rescue area extends from east of Tunisia to west of Crete, covering an area of around 250,000 km2.\n\nAs a military organisation, the AFM provides backup support to the Malta Police Force (MPF) and other government departments/agencies in situations as required in an organised, disciplined manner in the event of national emergencies (such as natural disasters) or internal security and bomb disposal.\n\nOn another level, the AFM establishes and/or consolidates bilateral co-operation with other countries to reach higher operational effectiveness related to AFM roles.\n\nGeography\n\nMalta is an archipelago in the central Mediterranean (in its eastern basin), some 80 km south of the Italian island of Sicily across the Malta Channel. Only the three largest islands – Malta (Malta), Gozo (Għawdex) and Comino (Kemmuna) – are inhabited. The smaller islands (see below) are uninhabited. The islands of the archipelago lie on the Malta plateau, a shallow shelf formed from the high points of a land bridge between Sicily and North Africa that became isolated as sea levels rose after the last Ice Age.  The archipelago is therefore situated in the zone between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates.  \n\nNumerous bays along the indented coastline of the islands provide good harbours. The landscape consists of low hills with terraced fields. The highest point in Malta is Ta' Dmejrek, at 253 m, near Dingli. Although there are some small rivers at times of high rainfall, there are no permanent rivers or lakes on Malta. However, some watercourses have fresh water running all year round at Baħrija near Ras ir-Raħeb, at l-Imtaħleb and San Martin, and at Lunzjata Valley in Gozo.\n\nPhytogeographically, Malta belongs to the Liguro-Tyrrhenian province of the Mediterranean Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Malta belongs to the ecoregion of \"Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub\". \n\nThe minor islands that form part of the archipelago are uninhabited and include:\n\n*Barbaġanni Rock (Gozo)\n*Cominotto, (Kemmunett)\n*Dellimara Island (Marsaxlokk)\n*Filfla (Żurrieq)/(Siġġiewi)\n*Fessej Rock\n*Fungus Rock, (Il-Ġebla tal-Ġeneral) (Gozo)\n*Għallis Rock (Naxxar)\n*Ħalfa Rock (Gozo)\n*Large Blue Lagoon Rocks (Comino)\n*Islands of St. Paul/Selmunett Island (Mellieħa)\n*Manoel Island, which connects to the town of Gżira, on the mainland, via a bridge\n*Mistra Rocks (San Pawl il-Baħar)\n*Taċ-Ċawl Rock (Gozo)\n*Qawra Point/Ta' Fraben Island (San Pawl il-Baħar)\n*Small Blue Lagoon Rocks (Comino)\n*Sala Rock (Żabbar)\n*Xrobb l-Għaġin Rock (Marsaxlokk)\n*Ta' taħt il-Mazz Rock\n\nClimate\n\nMalta has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa),  with very mild winters and warm to hot summers. Rain occurs mainly in autumn and winter, with summer being generally dry. According to International Living, Malta is the country with the best climate in the world. \n\nThe average yearly temperature is around 23 °C during the day and 16 °C at night. In the coldest month – January – the typically maximum temperature ranges from 12 to during the day and minimum 7 to at night. In the warmest month – August – the typically maximum temperature ranges from 28 to during the day and minimum 20 to at night. Generally – summers/holiday season lasts to 8 months, starting from around mid-April with temperatures 19 - during the day and 13 - at night, ending in November with temperatures 17 - during the day and 11 - at night, although also in the remaining 4 months temperatures sometimes reach 20 °C. Amongst all capitals in the continent of Europe, Valletta – the capital of Malta has the warmest winters, with average temperatures of around 16 °C during the day and 10 °C at night in the period January–February. In March and December average temperatures is around 17 °C during the day and 11 °C at night.  Large fluctuations in temperature are rare.\n\nAverage annual temperature of the sea is 20 °C, from 15 - in February to 26 °C in August. In the 6 months – from June to November – the average sea temperature exceeds 20 °C.  \n\nSunshine duration hours total around 3,000 per year (the highest results in Europe), from an average 5.2 hours of sunshine duration per day in December to an average above 12 hours in July. This is about double that of cities in the northern half of Europe, for comparison: London – 1,461; however, in winter it has up to four times more sunshine; for comparison: in December, London has 37 hours of sunshine whereas Malta has above 160.\n\nUrbanisation\n\nAccording to Eurostat, Malta is composed of two Larger Urban Zones nominally referred to as \"Valletta\" (the main island of Malta) and \"Gozo\".  According to Demographia, state is identified as urban area.  According to European Spatial Planning Observation Network, Malta is identified as Functional Urban Area (FUA).  According to United Nations, about 95% area of Malta is urban area and the number grows every year.  Also, according to the results of ESPON and EU Commission studies, \"the whole territory of Malta constitutes a single urban region\". \n\nOccasionally in the media and official publications Malta is referred to as a city-state.   Also, the Maltese coat-of-arms bears a mural crown described as \"representing the fortifications of Malta and denoting a City State\".  Malta, with area of 316 km2 and population of 0.4 million, is one of the most densely populated countries worldwide.\n\nEconomy\n\nMalta is classified as an advanced economy together with 32 other countries according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Until 1800 Malta depended on cotton, tobacco and its shipyards for exports. Once under British control, they came to depend on Malta Dockyard for support of the Royal Navy, especially during the Crimean war of 1854. The military base benefited craftsmen and all those who served the military.\n\nIn 1869, the opening of the Suez Canal gave Malta's economy a great boost, as there was a massive increase in the shipping which entered the port. Ships stopping at Malta's docks for refuelling helped the Entrepôt trade, which brought additional benefits to the island.\n\nHowever, towards the end of the 19th century the economy began declining, and by the 1940s Malta's economy was in serious crisis. One factor was the longer range of newer merchant ships that required less frequent refuelling stops.\n\nCurrently, Malta's major resources are limestone, a favourable geographic location and a productive labour force. Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies because of the drought in the summer and has no domestic energy sources, aside from the potential for solar energy from its plentiful sunlight.  The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles) and tourism.\n\nFilm production is a growing contributor to the Maltese economy.  The first film was shot in Malta in 1925 (Sons of the Sea);  over 100 feature films have been entirely or partially filmed in the country since then. Malta has served as a \"double\" for a wide variety of locations and historic periods including Ancient Greece, Ancient and Modern Rome, Iraq, the Middle East and many more. The Maltese government introduced financial incentives for filmmakers in 2005.  The current financial incentives to foreign productions currently stand at 25% with an additional 2% if Malta stands in as Malta; meaning a production can get up to 27% back on their eligible spending incurred in Malta.\n\nThe government is investing heavily in education, including college.\n\nIn preparation for Malta's membership in the European Union, which it joined on 1 May 2004, it privatised some state-controlled firms and liberalised markets. For example, the government announced on 8 January 2007 that it was selling its 40% stake in MaltaPost, to complete a privatisation process which has been ongoing for the past five years. In 2010, Malta managed to privatise telecommunications, postal services, shipyards and shipbuilding.\n\nMalta has taken important and substantial steps to establish itself as a global player in the cross-border fund administration business. Competing against countries like Ireland and Luxembourg, Malta has a unique combination of a multi-lingual workforce and a strong legal system. Malta has a mixed reputation for transparency and a DAW Index score of 6, although both are expected to improve as Malta increasingly adopts more comprehensive legislative framework for financial services.   Malta has a regulator, the MFSA, with a strong business development mindset, and the country has been successful in attracting gaming businesses, aircraft and ship registration, credit-card issuing banking licences and also fund administration. Service providers to these industries, including fiduciary and trustee business, are a core part of the growth strategy of the island. Malta has made strong headway in implementing EU Financial Services Directives including UCITs IV and soon AIFMD. As a base for alternative asset managers who must comply with new directives, Malta has attracted a number of key players including IDS, Iconic Funds, Apex Fund Services and TMF/Customs House. \n\nMalta and Tunisia are currently discussing the commercial exploitation of the continental shelf between their countries, particularly for petroleum exploration. These discussions are also undergoing between Malta and Libya for similar arrangements.\n\nMalta does not have a property tax. Its property market, especially around the harbour area, has been in constant boom, with the prices of apartments in some towns like Sliema and Gzira skyrocketing. \n\nAccording to Eurostat data, Maltese GDP per capita stood at 86 per cent of the EU average in 2010 with €21,000. \n\nBanking and finance\n\nThe two largest commercial banks are Bank of Valletta and HSBC Bank Malta, both of which can trace their origins back to the 19th century.\n\nThe Central Bank of Malta (Bank Ċentrali ta' Malta) has two key areas of responsibility: the formulation and implementation of monetary policy and the promotion of a sound and efficient financial system. It was established by the Central Bank of Malta Act on 17 April 1968. The Maltese government entered ERM II on 4 May 2005, and adopted the euro as the country's currency on 1 January 2008. \n\n[http://www.financemalta.org/ FinanceMalta] is the quasi-governmental organisation tasked with marketing and educating business leaders in coming to Malta and runs seminars and events around the world highlighting the emerging strength of Malta as a jurisdiction for banking and finance and insurance. \n\nTransport\n\nTraffic in Malta drives on the left. Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, considering the very small size of the islands; it is the fourth-highest in the European Union. The number of registered cars in 1990 amounted to 182,254, giving an automobile density of 582/km2 (1,510/sq mi). \n\nMalta has 2254 km of road, 1972 km (87.5%) of which are paved and 282 km were unpaved (as of December 2003). \nThe main roads of Malta from the southernmost point to the northernmost point are these: Triq Birżebbuġa in Birżebbuġa, Għar Dalam Road and Tal-Barrani Road in Żejtun, Santa Luċija Avenue in Paola, Aldo Moro Street (Trunk Road), 13 December Street and Ħamrun-Marsa Bypass in Marsa, Regional Road in Santa Venera/Msida/Gżira/San Ġwann, St Andrew's Road in Swieqi/Pembroke, Malta, Coast Road in Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq, Salina Road, Kennedy Drive, St. Paul's Bypass and Xemxija Hill in San Pawl il-Baħar, Mistra Hill, Wettinger Street (Mellieħa Bypass) and Marfa Road in Mellieħa.\n\nBuses (xarabank or karozza tal-linja) are the primary method of public transport. Established in 1905, they operated in the Maltese islands up to 2011 and became popular tourist attractions in their own right. To this day they are depicted on many Maltese advertisements to promote tourism as well as on gifts and merchandise for tourists.\n\nThe bus service underwent an extensive reform in July 2011. The management structure changed from having self-employed drivers driving their own vehicles to a service being offered by a single company through a public tender (in Gozo, being considered as a small network, the service was given through direct order).  The public tender was won by Arriva Malta, a member of the Arriva group, which introduced a fleet of brand new buses, built by King Long especially for service by Arriva Malta and including a smaller fleet of articulated buses brought in from Arriva London. It also operated two smaller buses for an intra-Valleta route only and 61 nine-metre buses, which were used to ease congestion on high density routes. Overall Arriva Malta operated 264 buses. On 1 January 2014 Arriva ceased operations in Malta due to financial difficulties, having been nationalised as Malta Public Transport by the Maltese government, with a new bus operator planned to take over their operations in the near future.   The government chose Autobuses Urbanos de León as its preferred bus operator for the country in October 2014.  The company took over the bus service on 8 January 2015, while retaining the name Malta Public Transport.  It introduced the pre-pay 'tallinja card'. With lower fares than the walk-on rate, it can be topped up online via tallinja.com.  The card was initially not well received, as reported by several local news sites.  During the first week of August 2015, another 40 buses of the Turkish make Otokar arrived and were put in to service. \n\nBetween 1883 and 1931, Malta had a railway line that connected Valletta to the army barracks at Mtarfa via Mdina and a number of towns and villages. The railway fell into disuse and eventually closed altogether, following the introduction of electric trams and buses. At the height of the bombing of Malta during the Second World War, Mussolini announced that his forces had destroyed the railway system but by the time war broke out, the railway had been mothballed for more than nine years.\n\nMalta has three large natural harbours on its main island:\n\n*The Grand Harbour (or Port il-Kbir), located at the eastern side of the capital city of Valletta, has been a harbour since Roman times. It has several extensive docks and wharves, as well as a cruise liner terminal. A terminal at the Grand Harbour serves ferries that connect Malta to Pozzallo & Catania in Sicily.\n*Marsamxett Harbour, located on the western side of Valletta, accommodates a number of yacht marinas.\n*Marsaxlokk Harbour (Malta Freeport), at Birżebbuġa on the south-eastern side of Malta, is the islands' main cargo terminal. Malta Freeport is the 11th busiest container ports in continent of Europe and 46th in the World with a trade volume of 2.3 million TEU's in 2008. \n\nThere are also two man-made harbours that serve a passenger and car ferry service that connects Ċirkewwa Harbour on Malta and Mġarr Harbour on Gozo. The ferry makes numerous runs each day.\n\nMalta International Airport (Ajruport Internazzjonali ta' Malta) is the only airport serving the Maltese islands. It is built on the land formerly occupied by the RAF Luqa air base. A heliport is also located there, but the scheduled service to Gozo ceased in 2006. The heliport in Gozo is at Xewkija. Since June 2007, Harbour Air Malta has operated a thrice-daily floatplane service between the sea terminal in Grand Harbour and Mgarr Harbour in Gozo.\n\nTwo further airfields at Ta' Qali and Ħal Far operated during the Second World War and into the 1960s but are now closed. Today, Ta' Qali houses a national park, stadium, the Crafts Village visitor attraction and the Malta Aviation Museum. This museum preserves several aircraft, including Hurricane and Spitfire fighters that defended the island in the Second World War.\n\nThe national airline is Air Malta, which is based at Malta International Airport and operates services to 36 destinations in Europe and North Africa. The owners of Air Malta are the Government of Malta (98%) and private investors (2%). Air Malta employs 1,547 staff. It has a 25% shareholding in Medavia.\n\nAir Malta has concluded over 191 interline ticketing agreements with other IATA airlines. It also has a codeshare agreement with Qantas covering three routes. In September 2007, Air Malta made two agreements with Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways by which Air Malta wet-leased two Airbus aircraft to Etihad Airways for the winter period starting 1 September 2007, and provided operational support on another Airbus A320 aircraft which it leased to Etihad Airways.\n\nCommunications\n\nThe mobile penetration rate in Malta stood at 101.3% as at the end of 2009.  Malta uses the GSM900 & UMTS(3G) mobile phone systems. This is compatible with the rest of the European countries, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nTelephone and cellular subscribers' numbers have eight digits, previously they were only six digits. There are no definite area codes in Malta, however after inception, the original first two numbers, and currently the 3rd and 4th digit, where assigned according to the locality. Fixed line telephone numbers have the prefix 21 and 27, although businesses may have numbers starting 22 or 23. An example would be 2*80**** if from Żabbar, and 2*23**** if from Marsa. Gozitan landline numbers generally are assigned 2*56****. Mobile telephone numbers have the prefix 79, 77, 98 or 99. When calling Malta from abroad, one must first dial the international access code, then the country code +356 and the subscriber's number.\n\nThe number of pay TV subscribers fell in 2012 as subscribers cut the cord and began to rely increasingly on IPTV: the number of IPTV subscribers doubled in the six months to June 2012.\n\nIn late 2012 GO began expanding its FttH network and capabilities, offering speeds of up to 200Mbit/s for its 'rapido' service.\n\nThe government in early 2012 called for a national FttH network to be built, with a minimum broadband service being upgraded from 4Mbit/s to 100Mbit/s. \n\nCurrency\n\nMaltese euro coins feature the Maltese cross on €2 and €1 coins, the coat of arms of Malta on the €0.50, €0.20 and €0.10 coins, and the Mnajdra Temples on the €0.05, €0.02 and €0.01 coins. \n\nMalta has produced collectors' coins with face value ranging from 10 to 50 euro. These coins continue an existing national practice of minting of silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the eurozone. For instance, a €10 Maltese commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.\n\nFrom 1972 until introduction of the Euro in 2008, the currency was the Maltese lira, which had replaced the Maltese pound. The pound replaced the Maltese scudo in 1825.\n\nTourism\n\nMalta is a popular tourist destination, with 1.6 million tourists per year.  Three times more tourists visit than there are residents. Tourism infrastructure has increased dramatically over the years and a number of good-quality hotels are present on the island, although overdevelopment and the destruction of traditional housing is of growing concern. An increasing number of Maltese now travel abroad on holiday. \n\nIn recent years, Malta has advertised itself as a medical tourism destination,  and a number of health tourism providers are developing the industry. However, no Maltese hospital has undergone independent international healthcare accreditation. Malta is popular with British medical tourists,  pointing Maltese hospitals towards seeking UK-sourced accreditation, such as with the Trent Accreditation Scheme. Dual accreditation with the American-oriented Joint Commission is necessary if hospitals in Malta wish to compete with the Far East and Latin America for medical tourists from the United States.\n\nScience and technology\n\nMalta signed a co-operation agreement with the European Space Agency (ESA) for more-intensive co-operation in ESA projects. \nThe Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST) is the civil body responsible for the development of science and technology on an educational and social level. Most science students in Malta graduate from the University of Malta and are represented by S-Cubed (Science Student's Society), UESA (University Engineering Students Association) and ICTSA (University of Malta ICT Students' Association).   \n\nDemographics\n\nMalta conducts a census of population and housing every ten years. The census held in November 2005 counted an estimated 96% of the population. A preliminary report was issued in April 2006 and the results were weighted to estimate for 100% of the population.\n\nNative Maltese people make up the majority of the island. However, there are minorities, the largest of which are Britons, many of whom are retirees.\nThe population of Malta  was estimated at 408,000. , 17% were aged 14 and under, 68% were within the 15–64 age bracket whilst the remaining 13% were 65 years and over. Malta's population density of 1,282 per square km (3,322/sq mi) is by far the highest in the EU and one of the highest in the world. By comparison, the average population density for the \"World (land only, excluding Antarctica)\" was 54 pop./km² as of July 2014.\n\nThe only census year showing a fall in population was that of 1967, with a 1.7% total decrease, attributable to a substantial number of Maltese residents who emigrated.   The Maltese-resident population for 2004 was estimated to make up 97.0% of the total resident population.\n\nAll censuses since 1842 have shown a slight excess of females over males. The 1901 and 1911 censuses came closest to recording a balance. The highest female-to-male ratio was reached in 1957 (1088:1000) but since then the ratio has dropped continuously. The 2005 census showed a 1013:1000 female-to-male ratio.\nPopulation growth has slowed down, from +9.5% between the 1985 and 1995 censuses, to +6.9% between the 1995 and 2005 censuses (a yearly average of +0.7%). The birth rate stood at 3860 (a decrease of 21.8% from the 1995 census) and the death rate stood at 3025. Thus, there was a natural population increase of 835 (compared to +888 for 2004, of which over a hundred were foreign residents). \n\nThe population's age composition is similar to the age structure prevalent in the EU. Since 1967 there was observed a trend indicating an ageing population, and is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Malta's old-age-dependency-ratio rose from 17.2% in 1995 to 19.8% in 2005, reasonably lower than the EU's 24.9% average; 31.5% of the Maltese population is aged under 25 (compared to the EU's 29.1%); but the 50–64 age group constitutes 20.3% of the population, significantly higher than the EU's 17.9%. Malta's old-age-dependency-ratio is expected to continue rising steadily in the coming years.\n\nMaltese legislation recognises both civil and canonical (ecclesiastical) marriages. Annulments by the ecclesiastical and civil courts are unrelated and are not necessarily mutually endorsed. Malta voted in favour of divorce legislation in a referendum held on 28 May 2011.  Abortion in Malta is illegal. A person must be 16 to marry.  The number of brides aged under 25 decreased from 1471 in 1997 to 766 in 2005; while the number of grooms under 25 decreased from 823 to 311. There is a constant trend that females are more likely than males to marry young. In 2005 there were 51 brides aged between 16 and 19, compared to 8 grooms.\n\nAt the end of 2007 the population of the Maltese Islands stood at 410,290 and is expected to reach 424,028 by 2025. At the moment, females slightly outnumber males, making up 50.3 per cent of the population. The largest proportion of persons - 7.5 per cent - were aged 25–29, while there were 7.3% falling into each of the 45–49 and 55–59 age brackets. \n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR)  was estimated at 1.53 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2,1.  In 2012, 25.8% of births were to unmarried women.  The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 79.98 years (77.69 years male, 82.41 years female).\n\nLanguages\n\nThe Maltese language () is the constitutional national language of Malta, having become official, however, only in 1934. Previously, Italian was the official and cultural language of Malta, in its Sicilian variant from the 12th century, and in its Tuscan variant from the 16th century. Alongside Maltese, English (imposed by the British after 1800) is also an official language of the country and hence the laws of the land are enacted both in Maltese and English. However, the Constitution states that if there is any conflict between the Maltese and the English texts of any law, the Maltese text shall prevail. The Constitution (clause 5 -2) also provides for the introduction of another official language; this was originally intended as a loophole for the possible reintroduction of Italian as the traditional partner of Maltese at an opportune time.\n\nMaltese is a Semitic language descended from the now defunct Sicilian-Arabic (Siculo-Arabic) dialect (from southern Italy).Joseph M. Brincat [http://macmillandictionaries.com/MED-Magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm Maltese – an unusual formula], MED Magazine (February 2005) The Maltese alphabet consists of 30 letters based on the Latin alphabet, including the diacritically altered letters ż, ċ and ġ, as well as the letters għ, ħ, and ie.\n\nMaltese has a Semitic base with substantial borrowing from Sicilian, Italian, a little French, and more recently and increasingly, English.  The hybrid character of Maltese was established by a long period of Maltese-Sicilian urban bilingualism gradually transforming rural speech and which ended in the early 19th century with Maltese emerging as the vernacular of the entire native population. The language includes different dialects that can vary greatly from one town to another or from one island to another.\n\nThe Eurobarometer states that 100% of the population speak Maltese. Also, 88% of the population speak English, 66% speak Italian, and 17% speak French.  This widespread knowledge of second languages makes Malta one of the most multilingual countries in the European Union. A study collecting public opinion on what language was \"preferred\" discovered that 86% of the population express a preference for Maltese, 12% for English, and 2% for Italian. Still, Italian television channels from Italy-based broadcasters, such as Mediaset and RAI, reach Malta and remain popular.Ignasi Badia i Capdevila; [http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/noves/hm04primavera-estiu/a_badia2_3.htm A view of the linguistic situation in Malta]; NovesSl; 2004. Retrieved 24 February 2008  \n\nLargest cities\n\nReligion\n\nThe Constitution of Malta declares Catholicism as the state religion although entrenched provisions for the freedom of religion are made. Freedom House and the CIA World Factbook report that 98% of the population is Catholic.\n\nThere are more than 360 churches in Malta, Gozo and Comino, or one church for every 1,000 residents. The parish church (Maltese: \"il-parroċċa\", or \"il-knisja parrokkjali\") is the architectural and geographic focal point of every Maltese town and village, and its main source of civic pride. This civic pride manifests itself in spectacular fashion during the local village festas, which mark the day of the patron saint of each parish with marching bands, religious processions, special Masses, fireworks (especially petards) and other festivities.\n\nMalta is an Apostolic See; the Acts of the Apostles tells of how St. Paul, on his way from Jerusalem to Rome to face trial, was shipwrecked on the island of \"Melite\", which many Bible scholars identify with Malta, an episode dated around AD 60. As recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul spent three months on the island on his way to Rome, curing the sick including the father of Publius, the \"chief man of the island\". Various traditions are associated with this account. The shipwreck is said to have occurred in the place today known as St Paul's Bay. The Maltese saint, Saint Publius is said to have been made Malta's first bishop and a grotto in Rabat, now known as \"St Paul's Grotto\" (and in the vicinity of which evidence of Christian burials and rituals from the 3rd century AD has been found), is among the earliest known places of Christian worship on the island.\n\nFurther evidence of Christian practices and beliefs during the period of Roman persecution appears in catacombs that lie beneath various sites around Malta, including St Paul's Catacombs and St Agatha's Catacombs in Rabat, just outside the walls of Mdina. The latter, in particular, were beautifully frescoed between 1200 and 1480, although marauding Turks defaced many of them in the 1550s. There are also a number of cave churches, including the grotto at Mellieħa, which is a Shrine of the Nativity of Our Lady where, according to legend, St. Luke painted a picture of the Madonna. It has been a place of pilgrimage since medieval times.\n\nThe Acts of the Council of Chalcedon record that in 451 AD, a certain Acacius was Bishop of Malta (Melitenus Episcopus). It is also known that in 501 AD, a certain Constantinus, Episcopus Melitenensis, was present at the Fifth Ecumenical Council. In 588 AD, Pope Gregory I deposed Tucillus, Miletinae civitatis episcopus and the clergy and people of Malta elected his successor Trajan in 599 AD. The last recorded Bishop of Malta before the invasion of the islands was a Greek named Manas, who was subsequently incarcerated at Palermo. \n\nMaltese historian, Giovanni Francesco Abela, states that following their conversion to Christianity at the hand of St. Paul, the Maltese retained their Christian religion, despite the Fatimid invasion.  Abela's writings describe Malta as a divinely ordained \"bulwark of Christian, European civilization against the spread of Mediterranean Islam\".  The native Christian community that welcomed Roger I of Sicily was further bolstered by immigration to Malta from Italy, in the 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nFor centuries, the Church in Malta was subordinate to the Diocese of Palermo, except when it was under Charles of Anjou, who appointed bishops for Malta, as did – on rare occasions – the Spanish and later, the Knights. Since 1808 all bishops of Malta have been Maltese. As a result of the Norman and Spanish periods, and the rule of the Knights, Malta became the devout Catholic nation that it is today. It is worth noting that the Office of the Inquisitor of Malta had a very long tenure on the island following its establishment in 1530: the last Inquisitor departed from the Islands in 1798, after the Knights capitulated to the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte. During the period of the Republic of Venice, several Maltese families emigrated to Corfu. Their descendants account for about two-thirds of the community of some 4,000 Catholics that now live on that island.\n\nThe patron saints of Malta are Saint Paul, Saint Publius and Saint Agatha. Although not a patron saint, St George Preca (San Ġorġ Preca) is greatly revered as the second canonised Maltese saint after St. Publius Malta‘s first acknowledged saint (canonised in the year 1634). Pope Benedict XVI canonised him on 3 June 2007. Also, a number of Maltese individuals are recognised as Blessed, including Maria Adeodata Pisani and Nazju Falzon, with Pope John Paul II having beatified them in 2001.\n\nVarious Roman Catholic religious orders are present in Malta, including the Jesuits, Franciscans, Dominicans and Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\nMost congregants of the local Protestant churches are not Maltese; their congregations draw on the many British retirees living in the country and vacationers from many other nations. There are approximately 600 Jehovah's Witnesses.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Bible Baptist Church, and the Fellowship of Evangelical Churches each have about 60 affiliates. There are also some churches of other denominations, including St. Andrew's Scots Church in Valletta (a joint Presbyterian and Methodist congregation) and St Paul's Anglican Cathedral, and a Seventh-day Adventist church in Birkirkara. A New Apostolic Church congregation was founded in 1983 in Gwardamangia. \n\nThe Jewish population of Malta reached its peak in the Middle Ages under Norman rule. In 1479, Malta and Sicily came under Aragonese rule and the Alhambra Decree of 1492 forced all Jews to leave the country, permitting them to take with them only a few of their belongings. Several dozen Maltese Jews may have converted to Christianity at the time to remain in the country. Today, there is one Jewish congregation.\n\nZen Buddhism and the Bahá'í Faith claim some 40 members.\n\nThere is one Muslim mosque, the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque. A Muslim primary school recently opened. Of the estimated 3,000 Muslims in Malta, approximately 2,250 are foreigners, approximately 600 are naturalised citizens, and approximately 150 are native-born Maltese. \n\nMigration\n\nInbound migration\n\nAs an EU member state and a party to the Schengen Agreement, Malta applies the EU's visa policy. This means that to enter the country:\n*Nationals of the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and their special territories and of Switzerland require only a passport or a national identity card. Except for Croatian nationals, citizens of this category of countries do not require a permit to stay and work legally in Malta. \n*Nationals of a number of non-EU and non-EEA countries (most countries of the Western Balkans, most countries of the American continent, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Malaysia and Japan) require only a passport and do not need a visa to reside in Malta for less than 90 days.\n*Nationals of other countries need a passport and a visa to enter the country, visas being valid for one month.\n\nThe estimated net inflow (using data for 2002 to 2004) was of 1,913 persons yearly. Over the last 10 years, Malta accepted back a yearly average of 425 returning emigrants. \n\nDuring 2006, a total of 1,800 illegal immigrants reached Malta making the crossing from the North African coast. Most of them intended to reach mainland Europe and happened to come to Malta due to their sub-standard vessels breaking down or being caught by Maltese and other EU officials.   In the first half of 2006, 967 irregular immigrants arrived in Malta - almost double the 473 who arrived in the same period in 2005.  Many immigrants have perished in the journey across the Mediterranean, with one notable incident being the May 2007 Malta migrant boat disaster. Since that time, there have been several additional boat sinkings, and only as recently as April 2015, some 700 immigrants perished en route to Italy when their boat capsized.  During 2014 alone, approximately 3,500 migrants drowned in their attempt to reach Europe.\n\nAround 45% of immigrants landed in Malta have been granted refugee (5%) or protected humanitarian status (40%). A White Paper suggesting the grant of Maltese citizenship to refugees resident in Malta for over ten years was issued in 2005. Historically Malta gave refuge (and assisted in their resettlement) to eight hundred or so East African Asians who had been expelled from Uganda by Idi Amin and to just under a thousand Iraqis fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\nDetention costs for the first half of 2006 alone cost €746,385. \n\nIn 2005, Malta sought EU aid in relation to reception of irregular immigrants, repatriation of those denied refugee status, resettlement of refugees into EU countries, and maritime security.  In December 2005, the European Council adopted The Global Approach to Migration: Priority Actions focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean; but the deployment of said actions has been limited to the western Mediterranean, thus putting further pressure on the central Mediterranean route for irregular immigration of which Malta forms a part.\n\nIn January 2014 Malta started granting citizenship for a €650,000 contribution plus investments, contingent on residence and criminal background requirements. \n\nOutbound migration\n\nIn the 19th century, most emigration from Malta was to North Africa and the Middle East, although rates of return migration to Malta were high. Nonetheless, Maltese communities formed in these regions. By 1900, for example, British consular estimates suggest that there were 15,326 Maltese in Tunisia, and in 1903 it was claimed that 15,000 people of Maltese origin were living in Algeria.\n\nMalta experienced significant emigration as a result of the collapse of a construction boom in 1907 and after the Second World War, when the birth rate increased significantly, but in the 20th century most emigrants went to destinations in the New World, particularly to Australia, Canada and the United States. After the Second World War, Malta's Emigration Department would assist emigrants with the cost of their travel. Between 1948 and 1967, 30 per cent of the population emigrated. Between 1946 and the late 1970s, over 140,000 people left Malta on the assisted passage scheme, with 57.6% migrating to Australia, 22% to the UK, 13% to Canada and 7% to the United States.\n\nEmigration dropped dramatically after the mid-1970s and has since ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance. However, since Malta joined the EU in 2004 expatriate communities emerged in a number of European countries particularly in Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\nEducation\n\nPrimary schooling has been compulsory since 1946; secondary education up to the age of sixteen was made compulsory in 1971. The state and the Church provide education free of charge, both running a number of schools in Malta and Gozo, including De La Salle College in Cospicua, St. Aloysius' College in Birkirkara, St. Paul's Missionary College in Rabat, Malta, St. Joseph's School in Blata l-Bajda and Saint Monica Girls' School in Mosta. , state schools are organised into networks known as Colleges and incorporate kindergarten schools, primary and secondary schools. A number of private schools are run in Malta, including San Andrea School and San Anton School in the valley of L-Imselliet (l/o Mġarr), St. Martin's College in Swatar and St. Michael's School in San Ġwann. St. Catherine's High School, Pembroke offers an International Foundation Course for students wishing to learn English before entering mainstream education. , there are two international schools, Verdala International School and QSI Malta. The state pays a portion of the teachers' salary in Church schools. \n\nEducation in Malta is based on the British model. Primary school lasts six years. At the age of 11 pupils sit for an examination to enter a secondary school, either a church school (the Common Entrance Examination) or a state school. Pupils sit for SEC O-level examinations at the age of 16, with passes obligatory in certain subjects such as mathematics, English and Maltese. Pupils may opt to continue studying at a sixth form college such as Gan Frangisk Abela Junior College, St. Aloysius' College, Giovanni Curmi Higher Secondary, De La Salle College, St Edward's College, or else at another post-secondary institution such as MCAST. The sixth form course lasts for two years, at the end of which students sit for the Matriculation examination. Subject to their performance, students may then apply for an undergraduate degree or diploma.\n\nThe University of Malta (U.o.M.) provides Tertiary education at diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate level. The adult literacy rate is 99.5%. \n\nMaltese and English are both used to teach pupils at primary and secondary school level, and both languages are also compulsory subjects. Public schools tend to use both Maltese and English in a balanced manner. Private schools prefer to use English for teaching, as is also the case with most departments of the University of Malta; this has a limiting effect on the capacity and development of the Maltese language. Most university courses are in English.\n\nOf the total number of pupils studying a first foreign language at secondary level, 51% take Italian whilst 38% take French. Other choices include German, Russian, Spanish, Latin, Chinese and Arabic. \n\nMalta is also a popular destination to study the English language, attracting over 80,000 students in 2012. \n\nHealthcare\n\nMalta has a long history of providing publicly funded health care. The first hospital recorded in the country was already functioning by 1372. \nToday, Malta has both a public healthcare system, known as the government healthcare service, where healthcare is free at the point of delivery, and a private healthcare system.   Malta has a strong general practitioner-delivered primary care base and the public hospitals provide secondary and tertiary care. The Maltese Ministry of Health advises foreign residents to take out private medical insurance. \n\nMalta also boasts voluntary organisations such as Alpha Medical (Advanced Care), the Emergency Fire & Rescue Unit (E.F.R.U.), St John Ambulance and Red Cross Malta who provide first aid/nursing services during events involving crowds.\n\nThe Mater Dei Hospital, Malta's primary hospital, opened in 2007. It has one of the largest medical buildings in Europe.\n\nThe University of Malta has a medical school and a Faculty of Health Sciences, the latter offering diploma, degree (BSc) and postgraduate degree courses in a number of health care disciplines.\n\nThe Medical Association of Malta represents practitioners of the medical profession. The Malta Medical Students' Association (MMSA) is a separate body representing Maltese medical students, and is a member of EMSA and IFMSA. MIME, the Maltese Institute for Medical Education, is an institute set up recently to provide CME to physicians in Malta as well as medical students. The Foundation Program followed in the UK has been introduced in Malta to stem the 'brain drain' of newly graduated physicians to the British Isles. The Malta Association of Dental Students (MADS) is a student association set up to promote the rights of Dental Surgery Students studying within the faculty of Dental Surgery of the University of Malta. It is affiliated with IADS, the International Association of Dental Students.\n\nSee also Health in Malta\n\nCulture\n\nThe culture of Malta reflects the various cultures that have come into contact with the Maltese Islands throughout the centuries, including neighbouring Mediterranean cultures, and the cultures of the nations that ruled Malta for long periods of time prior to its independence in 1964.\n\nMusic\n\nWhile Maltese music today is largely Western, traditional Maltese music includes what is known as għana. This consists of background folk guitar music, while a few people, generally men, take it in turns to argue a point in a sing-song voice. The aim of the lyrics, which are improvised, is to create a friendly yet challenging atmosphere, and it takes a number of years of practice to be able to combine the required artistic qualities with the ability to debate effectively.\n\nLiterature\n\nDocumented Maltese literature is over 200 years old. However, a recently unearthed love ballad testifies to literary activity in the local tongue from the Medieval period. Malta followed a Romantic literary tradition, culminating in the works of Dun Karm Psaila, Malta's National Poet. Subsequent writers like Ruzar Briffa and Karmenu Vassallo tried to estrange themselves from the rigidity of formal themes and versification.\n\nIt was late in the 1960s that Maltese literature experienced its most radical transformation among poets, prose writers and dramatists. Names of significant poets that stand out from the last quarter of the 20th century include Mario Azzopardi, Victor Fenech, Oliver Friggieri, Joe Friggieri, Charles Flores, Daniel Massa, Maria Ganado, Lillian Sciberras and Achille Mizzi. In prose, Frans Sammut (The National Modern Author of Malta), Paul P. Borg and Joe J. Camilleri led the avant-garde meanwhile among the prominent names in theatre are Francis Ebejer, Alfred Sant, Doreen Micallef, Oreste Calleja, Joe Friggieri and Martin Gauci.\n\nThe next generation of writers widened the tracks further, especially in prose. Guze' Stagno, Karl Schembri and Clare Azzopardi are young writers fast establishing themselves while in poetry, significant names include Adrian Grima, Immanuel Mifsud, Norbert Bugeja and Simone Inguanez.\n\nIn literary criticism, Peter Serracino Inglott, Oliver Friggieri and Charles Briffa introduced perceptive historical, philosophical and psycho-social themes into Maltese theory. Ivan Callus, current Head of the English Department at the University of Malta, is also an internationally known literary critic in academic circles for the English language.\n\nOther writers, born in Malta or of Maltese descent, have established careers abroad. These included the novelist Trezza Azzopardi, best-selling children's author Saviour Pirotta and comic-book artist/journalist Joe Sacco.\n\nArt and architecture\n\nMaltese architecture has been influenced by many different Mediterranean cultures and British architecture over its history. The first settlers on the island constructed Ġgantija, one of the oldest manmade freestanding structures in the world. The Neolithic temple builders 3800–2500 BC endowed the numerous temples of Malta and Gozo with intricate bas relief designs, including spirals evocative of the tree of life and animal portraits, designs painted in red ochre, ceramics and a vast collection of human form sculptures, particularly the Venus of Malta. These can be viewed at the temples themselves (most notably, the Hypogeum and Tarxien Temples), and at the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta. Malta is currently undergoing several large-scale building projects, including the construction of SmartCity Malta, the M-Towers and Pendergardens, while areas such as the Valletta Waterfront and Tigné Point have been or are being renovated.\n\nThe Roman period introduced highly decorative mosaic floors, marble colonnades and classical statuary, remnants of which are beautifully preserved and presented in the Roman Domus, a country villa just outside the walls of Mdina. The early Christian frescoes that decorate the catacombs beneath Malta reveal a propensity for eastern, Byzantine tastes. These tastes continued to inform the endeavours of medieval Maltese artists, but they were increasingly influenced by the Romanesque and Southern Gothic movements. Towards the end of the 15th century, Maltese artists, like their counterparts in neighbouring Sicily, came under the influence of the School of Antonello da Messina, which introduced Renaissance ideals and concepts to the decorative arts in Malta.  Malta's temples such as Imnajdra are full of history and have a story behind them.\n\nThe artistic heritage of Malta blossomed under the Knights of St. John, who brought Italian and Flemish Mannerist painters to decorate their palaces and the churches of these islands, most notably, Matteo Perez d'Aleccio, whose works appear in the Magisterial Palace and in the Conventual Church of St. John in Valletta, and Filippo Paladini, who was active in Malta from 1590 to 1595. For many years, Mannerism continued to inform the tastes and ideals of local Maltese artists.\n\nThe arrival in Malta of Caravaggio, who painted at least seven works during his 15-month stay on these islands, further revolutionised local art. Two of Caravaggio's most notable works, The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist and Saint Jerome Writing, are on display in the Oratory of the Conventual Church of St. John. His legacy is evident in the works of local artists Giulio Cassarino (1582–1637) and Stefano Erardi (1630–1716). However, the Baroque movement that followed was destined to have the most enduring impact on Maltese art and architecture. The glorious vault paintings of the celebrated Calabrese artist, Mattia Preti transformed the severe, Mannerist interior of the Conventual Church St. John into a Baroque masterpiece. Preti spent the last 40 years of his life in Malta, where he created many of his finest works, now on display in the Museum of Fine Arts in Valletta. During this period, local sculptor Melchior Gafà (1639–1667) emerged as one of the top Baroque sculptors of the Roman School.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, Neapolitan and Rococo influences emerged in the works of the Italian painters Luca Giordano (1632–1705) and Francesco Solimena (1657–1747), and these developments can be seen in the work of their Maltese contemporaries such as Giovanni Nicola Buhagiar (1698–1752) and Francesco Zahra (1710–1773). The Rococo movement was greatly enhanced by the relocation to Malta of Antoine de Favray (1706–1798), who assumed the position of court painter to Grand Master Pinto in 1744.\n\nNeo-classicism made some inroads among local Maltese artists in the late 18th century, but this trend was reversed in the early 19th century, as the local Church authorities – perhaps in an effort to strengthen Catholic resolve against the perceived threat of Protestantism during the early days of British rule in Malta – favoured and avidly promoted the religious themes embraced by the Nazarene movement of artists. Romanticism, tempered by the naturalism introduced to Malta by Giuseppe Calì, informed the \"salon\" artists of the early 20th century, including Edward and Robert Caruana Dingli.\n\nParliament established the National School of Art in the 1920s. During the reconstruction period that followed the Second World War, the emergence of the \"Modern Art Group\", whose members included Josef Kalleya (1898–1998), George Preca (1909–1984), Anton Inglott (1915–1945), Emvin Cremona (1919–1986), Frank Portelli (b. 1922), Antoine Camilleri (b. 1922) and Esprit Barthet (b. 1919) greatly enhanced the local art scene. In Valletta, the National Museum of Fine Arts features work from artists such as H. Craig Hanna.[http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2006-04-23/news/right-outside-my-window-90329/ \"Right Outside my Window\"], The Malta Independent, 23 April 2006. Retrieved 11 June 2014\n\nCuisine\n\nMaltese cuisine shows strong Sicilian and English influences as well as influences of Spanish, Maghrebin and Provençal cuisines. A number of regional variations, particularly with regards to Gozo, can be noted as well as seasonal variations associated with the seasonal availability of produce and Christian feasts (such as Lent, Easter and Christmas). Food has been important historically in the development of a national identity in particular the traditional fenkata (i.e. the eating of stewed or fried rabbit).\n\nThe favourite Maltese beverage was documented to be the Kinnie according to the National Statistics Office.\n\nCustoms\n\nA 2010 Charities Aid Foundation study found that Maltese were the most generous peoples in the world, with 83% contributing to charity. \n\nMaltese folktales include various stories about mysterious creatures and supernatural events. These were most comprehensively compiled by the scholar (and pioneer in Maltese archaeology) Manwel Magri  in his core criticism \"Ħrejjef Missirijietna\" (\"Fables from our Forefathers\"). This collection of material inspired subsequent researchers and academics to gather traditional tales, fables and legends from all over the Archipelago.\n\nMagri's work also inspired a series of comic books (released by Klabb Kotba Maltin in 1984): the titles included Bin is-Sultan Jiźźewweġ x-Xebba tat-Tronġiet Mewwija and Ir-Rjieħ. Many of these stories have been popularly re-written as Children's literature by authors writing in Maltese, such as Trevor Żahra. While giants, witches and dragons feature in many of the stories, some contain entirely Maltese creatures like the Kaw kaw, Il-Belliegħa and L-Imħalla among others. The traditional Maltese obsession with maintaining spiritual (or ritual) purity  means that many of these creatures have the role of guarding forbidden or restricted areas and attacking individuals who broke the strict codes of conduct that characterised the island's pre-industrial society.\n\nTraditions\n\nTraditional Maltese proverbs reveal a cultural importance of childbearing and fertility: \"iż-żwieġ mingħajr tarbija ma fihx tgawdija\" (a childless marriage cannot be a happy one). This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures. In Maltese folktales the local variant of the classic closing formula, \"and they all lived happily ever after\" is \"u għammru u tgħammru, u spiċċat\" (and they lived together, and they had children together, and the tale is finished). \n\nRural Malta shares in common with Mediterranean society a number of superstitions regarding fertility, menstruation and pregnancy, including the avoidance of cemeteries during the months leading up to childbirth, and avoiding the preparation of certain foods during menses. Pregnant women are encouraged to satisfy their cravings for specific foods, out of fear that their unborn child will bear a representational birth mark (Maltese: xewqa, literally \"desire\" or \"craving\"). Maltese and Sicilian women also share certain traditions that are believed to predict the sex of an unborn child, such as the cycle of the moon on the anticipated date of birth, whether the baby is carried \"high\" or \"low\" during pregnancy, and the movement of a wedding ring, dangled on a string above the abdomen (sideways denoting a girl, back and forth denoting a boy).\n\nTraditionally, Maltese newborns were baptised as promptly as possible, should the child die in infancy without receiving this vital Sacrament; and partly because according to Maltese (and Sicilian) folklore an unbaptised child is not yet a Christian, but \"still a Turk\". Traditional Maltese delicacies served at a baptismal feast include biskuttini tal-magħmudija (almond macaroons covered in white or pink icing), it-torta tal-marmorata (a spicy, heart-shaped tart of chocolate-flavoured almond paste), and a liqueur known as rożolin, made with rose petals, violets and almonds.\n\nOn a child's first birthday, in a tradition that still survives today, Maltese parents would organise a game known as il-quċċija, where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child. These may include a hard-boiled egg, a Bible, crucifix or rosary beads, a book, and so on. Whichever object the child shows most interest in is said to reveal the child's path and fortunes in adulthood.\n\nMoney refers to a rich future while a book expresses intelligence and a possible career as a teacher. Infants who select a pencil or pen will be writers. Choosing Bibles or rosary beads refers to a clerical or monastic life. If the child chooses a hard-boiled egg, it will have a long life and many children. More recent additions include calculators (refers to accounting), thread (fashion) and wooden spoons (cooking and a great appetite).\n\nTraditional Maltese weddings featured the bridal party walking in procession beneath an ornate canopy, from the home of the bride's family to the parish church, with singers trailing behind serenading the bride and groom. The Maltese word for this custom is il-ġilwa. This custom along with many others has long since disappeared from the islands, in the face of modern practices.\n\nNew wives would wear the għonnella, a traditional item of Maltese clothing. However, it is no longer worn in modern Malta. Today's couples are married in churches or chapels in the village or town of their choice. The nuptials are usually followed by a lavish and joyous wedding reception, often including several hundred guests. Occasionally, couples will try to incorporate elements of the traditional Maltese wedding in their celebration. A resurgent interest in the traditional wedding was evident in May 2007, when thousands of Maltese and tourists attended a traditional Maltese wedding in the style of the 16th century, in the village of Żurrieq. This included il-ġilwa, which led the bride and groom to a wedding ceremony that took place on the parvis of St. Andrew's Chapel. The reception that followed featured folklore music (għana) and dancing.\n\nFestivals\n\nLocal festivals, similar to those in Southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta and Gozo, celebrating weddings, christenings and, most prominently, saints' days, honouring the patron saint of the local parish. On saints' days, the festa reaches its apex with a High Mass featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint, after which a statue of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in respectful prayer. The atmosphere of religious devotion quickly gives way to several days of celebration and revelry: band processions, fireworks, and late night parties.\n\nCarnival (Maltese: il-karnival ta' Malta) has had an important place on the cultural calendar after Grand Master Piero de Ponte introduced it to the islands in 1535. It is held during the week leading up to Ash Wednesday, and typically includes masked balls, fancy dress and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical floats presided over by King Carnival (Maltese: ir-Re tal-Karnival), marching bands and costumed revellers.\n\nHoly Week (Maltese: il-Ġimgħa Mqaddsa) starts on Palm Sunday (Ħadd il-Palm) and ends on Easter Sunday (Ħadd il-Għid). Numerous religious traditions, most of them inherited from one generation to the next, are part of the paschal celebrations in the Maltese Islands, honouring the death and resurrection of Jesus.\n\nMnarja, or l-Imnarja (pronounced lim-nar-ya) is one of the most important dates on the Maltese cultural calendar. Officially, it is a national festival dedicated to the feast of Saints Peter and St. Paul. Its roots can be traced back to the pagan Roman feast of Luminaria (literally, \"the illumination\"), when torches and bonfires lit up the early summer night of 29 June.\n\nA national feast since the rule of the Knights, Mnarja is a traditional Maltese festival of food, religion and music. The festivities still commence today with the reading of the \"bandu\", an official governmental announcement, which has been read on this day in Malta since the 16th century. Originally, Mnarja was celebrated outside St. Paul's Grotto, in the north of Malta. However, by 1613 the focus of the festivities had shifted to the Cathedral of St. Paul, in Mdina, and featured torchlight processions, the firing of 100 petards, horseraces, and races for men, boys and slaves. Modern Mnarja festivals take place in and around the woodlands of Buskett, just outside the town of Rabat.\n\nIt is said that under the Knights, this was the one day in the year when the Maltese were allowed to hunt and eat wild rabbit, which was otherwise reserved for the hunting pleasures of the Knights. The close connection between Mnarja and rabbit stew (Maltese: \"fenkata\") remains strong today.\n\nIn 1854 British governor William Reid launched an agricultural show at Buskett which is still being held today. The farmers' exhibition is still a seminal part of the Mnarja festivities today.\n\nMnarja today is one of the few occasions when participants may hear traditional Maltese \"għana\". Traditionally, grooms would promise to take their brides to Mnarja during the first year of marriage. For luck, many of the brides would attend in their wedding gown and veil, although this custom has long since disappeared from the islands.\n\nIsle of MTV is a one-day music festival produced and broadcast on an annual basis by MTV. The festival has been arranged annually in Malta since 2007, with major pop artists performing each year. 2012 saw the performances of worldwide acclaimed artists Flo Rida, Nelly Furtado and Will.I.Am at Fosos Square in Floriana. Over 50,000 people attended, which marked the biggest attendance so far. \n\nIn 2009 the first New Year's Eve street party was organised in Malta, parallel to what other major countries in the world organise. Although the event was not highly advertised and controversial, due to the closing of an arterial street on the day, it is deemed to have been successful and will most likely be organised every year. \n\nThe Malta International Fireworks Festival is an annual festival that has been arranged in the Grand Harbour of Valletta since 2003. The festival offers fireworks displays of a number of Maltese as well as foreign fireworks factories. The festival is usually held in the last week of April every year.\n\nMedia\n\nThe most widely read and financially the strongest newspapers are published by Allied Newspapers Ltd., mainly The Times (27%) and The Sunday Times (51.6%). Due to bilingualism half of the newspapers are published in English and the other half in Maltese. The Sunday newspaper It-Torċa (\"The Torch\") published by the Union Press, a subsidiary of the General Workers' Union, is the widest Maltese language paper. Its sister paper, L-Orizzont (\"The Horizon\"), is the Maltese daily with biggest circulation. There is a high number of daily or weekly newspapers, there is one paper for every 28,000 people. Advertising, sales and subsidies are the three main methods of financing newspapers and magazines. However, most of the papers and magazines tied to institutions are subsidised by the same institutions, they depend on advertising or subsidies from their owners. \n\nThere are eight terrestrial television channels in Malta: TVM, TVM2, Parliament TV, One, NET Television, Smash Television, F Living and Xejk. These channels are transmitted by digital terrestrial, free-to-air signals on UHF channel 66.  The state and political parties subsidise most of the funding of these television stations. TVM, TVM2 and Parliament TV are operated by Public Broadcasting Services, the national broadcaster and member of the EBU. Media.link Communications Ltd., the owner of NET Television, and One Productions Ltd., the owner of One, are affiliated with the Nationalist and Labour parites, respectively. The rest are privately owned. The Malta Broadcasting Authority supervises all local broadcasting stations and ensures their compliance with legal and licence obligations as well as the preservation of due impartiality; in respect of matters of political or industrial controversy or relating to current public policy; while fairly apportioning broadcasting facilities and time between persons belong to different political parties. The Broadcasting Authority ensures that local broadcasting services consist of public, private and community broadcasts that offer varied and comprehensive programming to cater for all interests and tastes.\n\nThe Malta Communications Authority reported that there were 147,896 pay TV subscriptions active at the end of 2012, which includes analogue and digital cable, pay digital terrestrial TV and IPTV.  For reference the latest census counts 139,583 households in Malta.  Satellite reception is available to receive other European television networks such as the BBC from Great Britain and RAI and Mediaset from Italy.\n\nHolidays\n\nSport \n\nAssociation football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Malta. The national stadium is called Ta' Qali Stadium. The national football team has won several matches over big opponents that reached the final phases in World Cups, such as Belgium and Hungary. Recently a large number of football grounds have been built throughout the island. The top football league in Malta is called the Maltese Premier League, and consists of 12 teams. Futsal is also very popular.\n\nWaterpolo is also very popular in Malta. The Malta national waterpolo team has achieved some great results against strong teams, and has competed in the Olympics twice. Maltese clubs participate in the European Club competitions organised by LEN, are seen as being in the top 10 waterpolo leagues in Europe.\n\nRugby league is played in Malta. In September 2015 the national men's team was ranked 23rd in the world. The national team are known as the Malta Knights, and boast players currently playing in the European Superleague.\n\nRugby union is popular in Malta. In March 2014 the national men's team was ranked 43rd in the world. They have recently been achieving great success, defeating teams including Sweden, Croatia and Latvia.\n\nMotorsport includes drag racing represented by the Malta Drag Racing Association, with recent high ranking Maltese dragsters in official FIA European championships. There is also autocross (ASMK), hill climb (Island Car Club), motocross, karting and banger racing championships.\n\nMalta also hosts a snooker round, the Malta Cup, which  became a non-ranking event. In 2008 Malta's Tony Drago was a member of a victorious European Mosconi Cup team, which was played in Portomaso, Malta. Claudio Cassar was World Blackball Champion in 2014.\n\nBoxer Jeff Fenech is of Maltese descent.  Recently contact sports such as Boxing and Kickboxing have become increasingly popular.\n\nMalta is a good place for surfing and offers a lot of different surf spots.  During winter time most of the beaches transform into surfer hangouts.\n\nAlong with other sports, tennis is a popular activity in Malta and Gozo. The islands offer a wide range of options for both beginners and elite players. Clubs are spread out across Malta and games are being played on a regular basis all year around.[http://maltatennis.com]\n\nThere are over 1,200 rock climbing routes in Malta. The island offers a mixture of both trad climbing and sport climbing and also offers a good variety of bouldering and deep water soloing. The geography and small size of the island makes the climbing easily accessible. The sport is growing in popularity with local communities, as well as tourists and visitors.\n\nBoċċi is the Maltese version of the Italian game of bocce, French pétanque and British bowls. Other than certain differences in rules and the ground on which the game is played, one of the most obvious differences between Maltese boċċi and foreign equivalents is the shape of the bowls themselves which tend to be cylindrical rather than spherical in shape. Many small clubs (usually called Klabbs tal-Boċċi in Maltese) can be found in Maltese and Gozitan localities, and are usually well-frequented and are quite active on a local and European level.\n\nThe South End Core is a group of supporters or \"ultras\" who support the Maltese national teams. They mainly support football, futsal, water polo and rugby. They organise decorations, banners, chanting and tifo to support their country.",
                "The Maltese () are an ethnic group indigenous to Malta, and identified with the Maltese language. Malta is an island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Included within the ethnic group defined by the Maltese people are the Gozitans () who inhabit Malta's sister island, Gozo.\n\nHistory\n\nMalta has been inhabited from around 5200 BC, since the arrival of settlers from the island of Sicily.  A significant prehistoric Neolithic culture marked by Megalithic structures, which date back to c. 3600 BC, existed on the islands, as evidenced by the temples of Mnajdra, Ggantija and others. The Phoenicians colonized Malta between 800-700 BC, bringing their Semitic language and culture.  They used the islands as an outpost from which they expanded sea explorations and trade in the Mediterranean until their successors, the Carthaginians, were ousted by the Romans in 216 BC with the help of the Maltese inhabitants, under whom Malta became a municipium.\n\nAfter a period of Byzantine rule (4th to 9th century) and a probable sack by the Vandals,  the islands were invaded by the Aghlabids in AD 870. The fate of the population after the Arab invasion is unclear but it seems the islands may have been completely depopulated and were likely to have been repopulated in the beginning of the second millennium by settlers from Arab-ruled Sicily and Calabria who spoke Siculo-Arabic. \n\nThe Muslim rule was ended by the Normans who conquered the island in 1091, and their leader Roger I of Sicily was welcomed by the native Christians.  The islands were completely re-Christianised by 1249.  The islands were part of the Kingdom of Sicily until 1530, and were briefly controlled by the Capetian House of Anjou. In 1530 Charles I of Spain gave the Maltese islands to the Order of Knights of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in perpetual lease.\n\nThe French under Napoleon took hold of the Maltese islands in 1798, although with the aid of the British the Maltese were able to oust French control two years later. The inhabitants subsequently asked Britain to assume sovereignty over the islands under the conditions laid out in a Declaration of Rights,  stating that \"his Majesty has no right to cede these Islands to any power...if he chooses to withdraw his protection, and abandon his sovereignty, the right of electing another sovereign, or of the governing of these Islands, belongs to us, the inhabitants and aborigines alone, and without control.\" As part of the Treaty of Paris (1814) Malta became a British colony, ultimately rejecting an attempted integration with the United Kingdom in 1956.\n\nMalta became independent on 21 September 1964 (Independence Day). Under its 1964 constitution Malta initially retained Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Malta, with a Governor-General exercising executive authority on her behalf. On 13 December 1974 (Republic Day) it became a republic within the Commonwealth, with the President as head of state. On 31 March 1979 Malta saw the withdrawal of the last British troops and the Royal Navy from Malta. This day is known as Freedom Day and Malta declared itself as a neutral and non-aligned. Malta joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 and joined the Eurozone on 1 January 2008.\n\nCulture\n\nThe culture of Malta is a reflection of various cultures that have come into contact with the Maltese Islands throughout the centuries, including neighbouring Mediterranean cultures, and the cultures of the nations that ruled Malta for long periods of time prior to its independence in 1964.\n\nThe earliest inhabitants of the Maltese Islands are believed to have crossed over from nearby Sicily sometime before 5000 BC. The culture of modern Malta has been described as a \"rich pattern of traditions, beliefs and practices,\" which is the result of \"a long process of adaptation, assimilation and cross fertilization of beliefs and usages drawn from various conflicting sources.\"  It has been subjected to the same complex, historic processes that gave rise to the linguistic and ethnic admixture that defines who the people of Malta and Gozo are today. \n\nPresent-day Maltese culture is essentially Latin European with the recent British legacy also in evidence.  In the early part of its history Malta was also exposed to Arab influences. The present-day legacy of this is linguistic rather than cultural.  The Latin European element is the major source of Maltese culture because of the virtually continuous cultural impact on Malta over the past eight centuries and the fact that Malta shares the religious beliefs, traditions and ceremonies of its Sicilian and Southern European neighbors.\n\nLanguage\n\nMaltese people speak the Maltese language, a Semitic language written in the Latin alphabet in its standard form. The language is descended from Siculo-Arabic, a dialect of Arabic spoken in Sicily.[http://web.archive.org/web/20080509033627/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/MED-magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm MED Magazine] In the course of Malta's history, the language has adopted large amounts of vocabulary from Sicilian, Italian, English, and to a smaller degree, French. The official languages of Malta are Maltese and English.\n\nMaltese became an official language of Malta in 1934, replacing Italian and joining English. There are an estimated 371,900 speakers in Malta of the language, with statistics citing that 100% of the people are able to speak Maltese, 88% English, 66% Italian and 17% French, showing a greater degree of linguistic capabilities than most other European countries.  In fact multilingualism is a common phenomenon in Malta, with English, Maltese and on occasion Italian, used in everyday life. Whilst Maltese is the national language, it has been suggested that with the ascendancy of English language shift may begin;  however, this has been discredited by contemporary studies. \n\nReligion\n\nThe Constitution of Malta provides for freedom of religion but establishes Roman Catholicism as the state religion.\n\nMalta is described in the Book of Acts ( and ) as the place where Paul the Apostle was shipwrecked on his way to Rome, awaiting trial. Freedom House and the World Factbook report that 98% of the Maltese are Roman Catholic, making the nation one of the most Catholic countries in the world. \n\nMaltese emigration and expatriation\n\nIn the nineteenth century, most migration from Malta was to North Africa and the Middle East, although rates of return migration to Malta were high.  Nonetheless, Maltese communities formed in these regions. By 1900, for example, British consular estimates suggest that there were 15,326 Maltese in Tunisia. \n\nMalta experienced significant emigration as a result of the collapse of a construction boom in 1907 and after World War II, when the birth rate increased significantly, but in the twentieth century most emigrants went to destinations in the New World, particularly the United States and Australia. After World War II, Malta's Emigration Department would assist emigrants with the cost of their travel. Between 1948 and 1967, 30 per cent of the population emigrated. Between 1946 and the late 1970s, over 140,000 people left Malta on the assisted passage scheme, with 57.6 per cent migrating to Australia, 22 per cent to the UK, 13 per cent to Canada and 7 per cent to the United States. \n\n46,998 Maltese-born residents were recorded by the 2001 Australian Census, 30,178 by the 2001 UK Census, 9,525 by the 2001 Canadian Census and 9,080 by the 2000 United States Census. \n\nEmigration dropped dramatically after the mid-1970s and has since ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance. However, since Malta joined the EU in 2004 expatriate communities emerged in a number of European countries particularly in Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\nGenetics\n\nY-DNA haplogroups are found at the following frequencies in Malta: R1  (35.55% including 32.2% R1b), J (28.90% including 21.10% J2 and 7.8% J1), I (12.20%), E (11.10% including 8.9% E1b1b), F (6.70%), K (4.40%), P (1.10%).  Haplogroup R1, I and J2 are typical in European populations and E, K, F haplogroups consist of lineages with differential distribution within the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. The study by Capelli et al. has concluded that the contemporary males of Malta most likely originated from Southern Italy.   The study clustered the male Maltese genetic markers with those of Sicilians and Calabrians, while showing a minuscule amount of input from the Eastern Mediterranean with genetic affinity to Christian Lebanon. There was also little genetic input found from North Africa. \nAnother study carried out by geneticists Spencer Wells and Pierre Zalloua of the American University of Beirut showed that more than 50% of Y-chromosomes from Maltese men could have Phoenician origins.  However, it has been noted that this latter study was published as an interview in a popular magazine which is not a peer-reviewed academic journal and its conclusions disagree with the findings of the previously mentioned major peer-reviewed studies. The study by Capelli et al. indicates that Malta was barely inhabited at the turn of the tenth century and was likely to have been repopulated by settlers from Sicily and Calabria who spoke Siculo-Arabic. \n.\n\nPopulation links\n\nThe first settlers of Malta were from the island of Sicily. However, the result of the influences on the population after this have been fiercely debated among historians and geneticists. The origins question is complicated by numerous factors, including Malta's turbulent history of invasions and conquests, with long periods of depopulation followed by periods of immigration to Malta and intermarriage with the Maltese by foreigners from the Mediterranean, Western and Southern European countries that ruled Malta.\n\nThe many demographic influences on the island include:\n* The Phoenician colonisation around 800-700 BC.\n* The exile to Malta of the entire male population of the town of Celano (Italy) in 1223\n* The stationing of Swabian and Sicilian Italian troops on Malta in 1240\n* The removal of all remaining Arabs from Malta in 1224 \n* The arrival of several thousands Aragonese (Spain) soldiers in 1283 to 1425.\n* Further waves of European repopulation throughout the 13th century \n* The settlement in Malta of noble families from Sicily (Italy) and Aragon (Spain) between 1372 and 1450\n* The arrival of several thousand Greek Rhodian sailors, soldiers and slaves with the Knights of St. John\n* The introduction of several thousand Sicilian laborers in 1551 and again in 1566\n* The emigration of some 891 Italian exiles to Malta during the Risorgimento in 1849\n* The posting of some 22,000 British servicemen in Malta from 1807 to 1979,  as well as other British and Irish that settled in Malta over the decades\n* The mass emigration occurring after World War II and well into the 1960s and 70s. Many Maltese left the island for the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the USA. Following Malta's accession to the EU in 2004 expatriate communities grew in European countries such as the one in Belgium.\n\nHistorical accounts\n\nOver time, the various rulers of Malta published their own view of the ethnicity of the population.  The Knights of Malta downplayed the role of Islam in Malta and promoted the idea of a continuous Roman Catholic presence,  and the British colonial rule disregarded a genetic and cultural connection between the Maltese and Italians in an attempt to counteract growing Fascist power in the area."

                "Daniel \"Dan\" Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author of thriller fiction who is best known for the 2003 bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code.  Brown's novels are treasure hunts set in a 24-hour period,Brown. Witness statement; Pages 17 & 21. and feature the recurring themes of cryptography, keys, symbols, codes, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 52 languages, and as of 2012, sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), and Inferno (2013), have been or are being adapted into films.\n\nBrown's novels that feature the lead character Robert Langdon also include historical themes and Christianity as motifs, and as a result, have generated controversy. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian, though he is on a 'constant spiritual journey' himself, and says that his book The Da Vinci Code is simply \"an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate\" and suggests that the book may be used \"as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith.\"\n\nEarly life\n\nDan Brown was born and raised in Exeter, New Hampshire, the eldest of three children. He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement in 1997.  Brown's parents are singers and musicians, having served as church choir masters, with his mother, Constance serving as church organist.   Brown was raised an Episcopalian,Paulson, Michael., [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles_of_faith/2009/09/dan_brown_on_re.html \"Dan Brown on religion and writing\"] Boston.com, September 20, 2009. but has stated he had drifted away from Christianity before finding a renewed interest in religion. \n\nBrown's interest in secrets and puzzles stems from their presence in his household as a child, where codes and ciphers were the linchpin tying together the mathematics, music, and languages in which his parents worked. The young Brown spent hours working out anagrams and crossword puzzles, and he and his siblings participated in elaborate treasure hunts devised by their father on birthdays and holidays. On Christmas, for example, Brown and his siblings did not find gifts under the tree, but followed a treasure map with codes and clues throughout their house and even around town to find the gifts. Brown's relationship with his father inspired that of Sophie Neveu and Jacques Saunière in The Da Vinci Code, and Chapter 23 of that novel was inspired by one of his childhood treasure hunts. \n\nAfter graduating from Phillips Exeter, Brown attended Amherst College, where he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity. He played squash, sang in the Amherst Glee Club, and was a writing student of visiting novelist Alan Lelchuk. Brown spent the 1985 school year abroad in Seville, Spain, where he was enrolled in an art history course at the University of Seville. Brown graduated from Amherst in 1986.

Creating Connections: A Campaign for Amherst. Amherst College; retrieved August 9, 2012.\n\nSongwriter and pop singer\n\nAfter graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a synthesizer, and self-producing a children's cassette entitled SynthAnimals, which included a collection of tracks such as \"Happy Frogs\" and \"Suzuki Elephants\"; it sold a few hundred copies. He then formed his own record company called Dalliance, and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled Perspective, targeted to the adult market, which also sold a few hundred copies. In 1991 he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as singer-songwriter and pianist. To support himself, he taught classes at Beverly Hills Preparatory School.  \n\nHe also joined the National Academy of Songwriters, and participated in many of its events. It was there that he met Blythe Newlon, a woman 12 years his senior, who was the Academy's Director of Artist Development. Though it was not officially part of her job, she took on the seemingly unusual task of helping to promote Brown's projects; she wrote press releases, set up promotional events, and put him in contact with people who could be helpful to his career. She and Brown also developed a personal relationship, though this was not known to all of their associates until 1993, when Brown moved back to New Hampshire, and it was learned that Newlon would accompany him. They married in 1997, at Pea Porridge Pond, near Conway, New Hampshire.Walters, Joanna and Alice O'Keeffe. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1729079,00.html How Dan Brown's wife unlocked the code to bestseller success], observer.guardian.co.uk, March 12, 2006.\n\nIn 1994 Brown released a CD titled Angels & Demons. Its artwork was the same ambigram by artist John Langdon which he later used for the novel Angels & Demons. The liner notes also again credited his wife for her involvement, thanking her \"for being my tireless cowriter, coproducer, second engineer, significant other, and therapist.\" The CD included songs such as \"Here in These Fields\" and the religious ballad, \"All I Believe\". \nBrown and his wife, Blythe, moved to his home town in New Hampshire in 1993. Brown became an English teacher at his alma mater Phillips Exeter, and gave Spanish classes to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at Lincoln Akerman School, a small school for K–8th grade with about 250 students, in Hampton Falls. \n\nWriting career\n\nWhile on vacation in Tahiti in 1993, Brown read Sidney Sheldon's novel The Doomsday Conspiracy, and was inspired to become a writer of thrillers.   He started work on Digital Fortress, setting much of it in Seville, where he had studied in 1985. He also co-wrote a humor book with his wife, 187 Men to Avoid: A Survival Guide for the Romantically Frustrated Woman, under the pseudonym \"Danielle Brown\". The book's author profile reads, \"Danielle Brown currently lives in New England: teaching school, writing books, and avoiding men.\" The copyright is attributed to Dan Brown.\n\nIn 1996 Brown quit teaching to become a full-time writer. Digital Fortress was published in 1998. His wife, Blythe, did much of the book's promotion, writing press releases, booking Brown on talk shows, and setting up press interviews. A few months later, Brown and his wife released The Bald Book, another humor book. It was officially credited to his wife, though a representative of the publisher said that it was primarily written by Brown. Brown subsequently wrote Angels & Demons and Deception Point, released in 2000 and 2001 respectively, the former of which was the first to feature the lead character, Harvard symbology expert Robert Langdon.\n\nBrown's first three novels had little success, with fewer than 10,000 copies in each of their first printings. His fourth novel, The Da Vinci Code, became a bestseller, going to the top of the New York Times Best Seller list during its first week of release in 2003. It is now credited with being one of the most popular books of all time, with 81 million copies sold worldwide as of 2009.   Its success has helped push sales of Brown's earlier books. In 2004 all four of his novels were on the New York Times list in the same week,  and in 2005 he made Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of the year. Forbes magazine placed Brown at No. 12 on their 2005 \"Celebrity 100\" list, and estimated his annual income at US$76.5 million. The Times estimated his income from Da Vinci Code sales as $250 million.\n\nBrown's third novel featuring Robert Langdon, The Lost Symbol, was released on September 15, 2009.  According to the publisher, on its first day the book sold over one million in hardcover and e-book versions in the US, the UK and Canada, prompting the printing of 600,000 hardcover copies in addition to the five million first printing.  The story takes place in Washington D.C. over a period of 12 hours, and features the Freemasons. Brown's promotional website states that puzzles hidden in the book jacket of The Da Vinci Code, including two references to the Kryptos sculpture at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, give hints about the sequel. This repeats a theme from some of Brown's earlier work. \n\nBrown's fourth novel featuring Robert Langdon, Inferno is a mystery thriller novel released on May 14, 2013, by Doubleday.  It immediately became a bestseller. \n\nIn a 2006 interview, Brown stated that he had ideas for about 12 future books featuring Robert Langdon. \n\nCharacters in Brown's books are often named after real people in his life. Robert Langdon is named after John Langdon, the artist who created the ambigrams used for the Angels & Demons CD and novel. Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is named after \"On A Claire Day\" cartoonist friend Carla Ventresca. In the Vatican archives,  Langdon recalls a wedding of two people named Dick and Connie, which are the names of his parents. Robert Langdon's editor Jonas Faukman is named after Brown's real life editor Jason Kaufman. Brown also said that characters were based on a New Hampshire librarian, and a French teacher at Exeter, André Vernet. Cardinal Aldo Baggia, in Angels & Demons, is named after Aldo Baggia, instructor of modern languages at Phillips Exeter Academy. \n\nIn interviews, Brown has said his wife, Blythe, is an art historian and painter. When they met, she was the Director of Artistic Development at the National Academy for Songwriters in Los Angeles. During the 2006 lawsuit over alleged copyright infringement in The Da Vinci Code, information was introduced at trial that showed that Blythe did research for the book.  In one article, she was described as \"chief researcher.\" \n\nInfluences and habits\n\nIn addition to Sidney Sheldon, Brown has been quite vocal about a number of other literary influences who have inspired his writing. He has named his six favorite literary works as Gödel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter, Codes Ciphers & Other Cryptic & Clandestine Communication by Fred Wrixon, Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, Wordplay: Ambigrams and Reflections on the Art of Ambigrams by John Langdon, Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing and The Puzzle Palace by James Bamford. Commenting on Much Ado About Nothing, Brown says, \"I didn't understand how funny this play Much Ado About Nothing truly was until I became an English teacher and had to teach it. There is no wittier dialogue anywhere.\" Speaking of Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Trilogy, he states, \"Ludlum's early books are complex, smart, and yet still move at a lightning pace. This series got me interested in the genre of big-concept, international thrillers.\" [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?cid\n1040938 \"Meet the Writers: Dan Brown\"], barnesandnoble.com; retrieved September 8, 2013. His other favorite books include Kane and Abel by Jeffrey Archer, Plum Island by Nelson DeMille and The Elements of Style by Strunk and White. Recurring elements that Brown prefers to incorporate into his novels include a simple hero pulled out of their familiar setting and thrust into a new one with which they are unfamiliar, strong female characters, travel to interesting locations, and a 24-hour time frame in which the story takes place.\n\nBecause of the research-intensive nature of his novels, Brown can spend up to two years writing them. To remain focused on such projects, Brown ensures that when he chooses a theme for the novel (what he refers to as the \"big idea\"), and its subject, that they be those that can hold his interest. In Brown's view, the ideal topic does not have an easily defined right or wrong view, but presents a moral grey area that can lend itself to debate. Because his favorite subjects include codes, puzzles, treasure hunts, secretive organizations and academic lectures on obscure topics, he tends to incorporate those into his novels. Because Brown considers writing to be a discipline that requires constant practice, he has developed a routine to maintain his abilities. He wakes up at 4:00 am when there are no distractions (a practice he began with Digital Fortress when he had two daytime teaching jobs) and when he feels most productive, in order to give symbolic importance to the first order of business each day. He keeps an antique hourglass on his desk, so that he can stop briefly every hour to do push-ups, sit-ups and stretching exercises to keep his blood flowing.  Brown does his writing in his loft. He has also told fans that he uses inversion therapy to help with writer's block. He uses gravity boots and says, \"hanging upside down seems to help me solve plot challenges by shifting my entire perspective.\" \n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 2006 Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code was released as a film by Columbia Pictures, with director Ron Howard. It was widely anticipated and launched the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, though it received overall poor reviews. It currently has a 24% rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, derived from 165 negative reviews of the 214 counted.  It was later listed as one of the worst films of 2006 on Ebert & Roeper,  but also the second highest grossing film of the year, pulling in  US$750 million worldwide.  Brown was listed as one of the executive producers of the film The Da Vinci Code, and also created additional codes for the film. One of his songs, \"Phiano,\" which Brown wrote and performed, was listed as part of the film's soundtrack. In the film, Brown and his wife can be seen in the background of one of the early book signing scenes.\n\nThe next film, Angels & Demons, was released on May 15, 2009, with Howard and Hanks returning. It, too, garnered mostly negative reviews, though critics were kinder to it than to its predecessor. , it has a 37% meta-rating at Rotten Tomatoes. \n\nFilmmakers expressed interest in adapting The Lost Symbol into a film as well.   The screenplay was being written by Danny Strong, with pre-production expected to begin in 2013. According to a January 2013 article in the Los Angeles Times the final draft of the screenplay was due sometime in February, but in July 2013, Sony Pictures announced they would instead adapt Inferno for an October 14, 2016  release date with Ron Howard as director, David Koepp adapting the screenplay and Tom Hanks reprising his role as Robert Langdon. \n\nImagine Entertainment is set to produce a television series based on Digital Fortress, to be written by Josh Goldin and Rachel Abramowitz. \n\nCopyright infringement cases\n\nIn August 2005 author Lewis Perdue unsuccessfully sued Brown for plagiarism, on the basis of claimed similarity between The Da Vinci Code and his novels, The Da Vinci Legacy (1983) and Daughter of God (2000). Judge George Daniels said, in part: \"A reasonable average lay observer would not conclude that The Da Vinci Code is substantially similar to Daughter of God.\" \n\nIn April 2006 Brown's publisher, Random House, won a copyright infringement case brought by authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, who claimed that Brown stole ideas from their 1982 book Holy Blood Holy Grail for his 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code. It was in the book Holy Blood Holy Grail that Baigent, Leigh, and co-author Henry Lincoln had advanced the theory that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had a child and that the bloodline continues to this day. Brown apparently alluded to the two authors' names in his book. Leigh Teabing, a lead character in both the novel and the film, uses Leigh's name as the first name, and anagrammatically derives his last name from Baigent's. Mr Justice Peter Smith found in Brown's favor in the case, and as a private amusement, embedded his own Smithy code in the written judgment. \n\nOn March 28, 2007, Brown's publisher, Random House, won an appeal copyright infringement case. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales rejected the efforts from Baigent and Leigh, who became liable for paying legal expenses of nearly US$6 million. \n\nCharity work\n\nIn October 2004, Brown and his siblings donated US$2.2 million to Phillips Exeter Academy in honor of their father, to set up the Richard G. Brown Technology Endowment to help \"provide computers and high-tech equipment for students in need.\" \n\nBrown and his wife Blythe are supporters of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation. \n\nOn April 14, 2011, Dan and Blythe Brown created an eponymous scholarship fund to celebrate his 25th reunion from Amherst College, a permanently endowed scholarship fund at the college whose income provides financial aid to students there, with preference for incoming students with an interest in writing.\n\nOn June 16, 2016, Dan Brown donated US$337,000 to the Ritman Library in Amsterdam to digitize a collection of ancient books. \n\nCriticism\n\nBrown's prose style has been criticized as clumsy,   with The Da Vinci Code being described as 'committing style and word choice blunders in almost every paragraph'.  Much of the criticism was centered on Brown's claim found in its preface that the novel is based on fact in relation to Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion, and that \"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in [the] novel are accurate.\"  \n\nIn an interview with Matt Lauer on The Today Show in September 2009, Brown responded by saying, \"I do something very intentional and specific in these books. And that is to blend fact and fiction in a very modern and efficient style, to tell a story.

He is a Harvard University professor of religious iconology and symbology (a fictional field related to the study of historic symbols, which is not methodologically connected to the actual discipline of Semiotics).\n\nTom Hanks portrayed Robert Langdon in the 2006 film adaptation of The Da Vinci Code, reprised the role in the 2009 film adaptation of Angels & Demons, and will play the role again in the 2016 film adaptation of Inferno. \n\nCharacter development\n\nDan Brown created the character as a fictional alter ego of himself or \"the man he wishes he could be\".  Brown himself was born June 22, 1964 in Exeter, New Hampshire, and the fictional Langdon is described as having been born on June 22, also in Exeter, and attending the same school as Brown did, Phillips Exeter Academy. Initially it is established that Langdon is a successful scholar who Brown named after John Langdon, a professor of typography at Drexel University who is known for his creation of ambigrams. An example of Langdon's ambigrams appeared on the cover of the first edition of Brown’s novel Angels & Demons, and other ambigrams featured throughout that novel were also designed by Langdon. On the acknowledgments page, Brown calls Langdon \"one of the most ingenious and gifted artists alive … who rose brilliantly to my impossible challenge and created the ambigrams for this novel\". John Langdon also created the logo for the fictional Depository Bank of Zurich, which appears in The Da Vinci Code film.\n\nIn an interview, Brown said that Joseph Campbell was an inspiration for the character of Langdon:\n\nStoryline\n\nRobert Langdon, born in Exeter, New Hampshire, United States, is described as looking like \"Harrison Ford in Harris tweed\",  with his standard attire being a turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers, which he wears in all instances, from lectures to social events.  A frequently referred to accessory is his Mickey Mouse watch, a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday.  He drives an automatic Saab 900S.  \n\nLangdon was a diver at Phillips Exeter Academy in prep school and played water polo at Princeton University where he went for college. He suffers from claustrophobia, as he fell into a well when he was 7 years old. His father died when he was 12, and his new mentor father-figure became Peter Solomon,  Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. \n\nKnown for a brilliant problem-solving mind and his genius, Langdon has an eidetic memory.  As professor at Harvard University, he teaches religious iconology and the fictional field of symbology.  As a hobby it is specifically mentioned that Langdon is a great swimmer and swam laps (50) daily, a \"morning ritual,\" at Harvard's athletic facilities (hence the lap swimming scene in the Angels and Demons movie). Langdon also mentions he was raised a Catholic, but that he will never understand God; in A&D, he mentions to the Camerlengo that faith is a gift he has yet to receive.\n\nIn the books, the events of TDC follow those of A&D; this was reversed in the movies, where A&D is portrayed as a sequel to the previous movie.\n\nAngels & Demons\n\nIn Angels & Demons, Robert Langdon is called to CERN headquarters in Switzerland to find about the religious symbological implications of the death of CERN's finest and best-known physicist, Leonardo Vetra, a Catholic priest who has been branded with the Illuminati symbol. When he starts to investigate the murder, his obsession for the subject history comes into play. Langdon is later joined in the investigation by Vittoria Vetra (Leonardo's adopted daughter) and they start their journey to the Vatican to unlock the mystery behind the Illuminati, an anti-Catholic secret society which, according to the plot, has deeply infiltrated many global institutions, political, economical and religious. Langdon and Vetra solve the mystery of the Illuminati by following the Path of Illumination  and in so doing explain the disappearances of four Cardinals during a papal conclave, the murder of Leonardo Vetra, and the theft of antimatter (a substance that can be used for mass destruction). At the end of the novel Langdon ends up having a relationship with Vittoria Vetra. In the last few sentences of Angels & Demons, Vittoria Vetra asks him if he has ever had a divine experience. When he replies in the negative, Vittoria slips off her terrycloth robe, saying, \"You've never been to bed with a yoga master, have you?\" Their relationship, however, is only referred to in The Da Vinci Code, mentioning the fact that Langdon had last seen Vittoria a year previously.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code\n\nIn the beginning of 2003's The Da Vinci Code, Robert Langdon is in Paris to give a lecture on his work. Having made an appointment to meet with Jacques Saunière, the curator of the Louvre, he is startled to find the French police at his hotel room door. They inform him that Saunière has been murdered and they would like his immediate assistance at the Louvre to help them solve the crime. Unknown to Langdon, he is in fact the prime suspect in the murder and has been summoned to the scene of the crime so that the police may extract a confession from him. While he is in the Louvre, he meets Sophie Neveu, a young cryptologist from the DCPJ. When Langdon and Sophie get the chance to talk in private, he finds out that Jacques Saunière is her grandfather. Saunière instructs Sophie to 'find Robert Langdon', according to the message he left for her in the floor. Hence, Sophie believes he is innocent of her grandfather's murder.\n\nHe spends the rest of the novel dodging the police and trying to solve the mystery of an ancient secret society, the Priory of Sion, which was once headed by Leonardo da Vinci. At the end of the novel, Langdon uncovers the mystery behind Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail also called Sangreal, derived from either the Spanish \"San Greal\" (the Holy Grail), or the French \"Sang real\"(royal blood). He also seems to fall in love with Sophie Neveu at the end of the book, his \"love of bachelorhood (having been) severely shook up\".\n\nThe Lost Symbol\n\nIn The Lost Symbol, Robert Langdon has an adventure with the concepts of Freemasonry in Washington D.C. Tricked into visiting the nation's Capitol, Robert Langdon spends twelve hours racing through the monuments and buildings of the USA's forefathers, searching for the truth about the secret society of the Masons. Behind new doors lie secrets that promise to change the way people view science and politics, now threatened by Zachary Solomon, the renegade, estranged son of Robert Langdon's friend, Peter Solomon, who has himself been kidnapped by Zachary, now going by the name Mal'akh. Robert Langdon is the last line of defense. With help from Katherine Solomon (Peter's younger sister), Warren Bellamy (the Architect of the Capitol) and Inoue Sato (the director of the CIA).\n\nInferno\n\nIn Inferno, Langdon wakes up in an Italian hospital with no memory of the events that led him to be in Italy. Soon he realizes that someone is trying to kill him. Langdon travels to Florence, Venice, and Istanbul with Doctor Sienna Brooks to prevent a biological attack by looking for a deadly virus that was planted by a client of a shadowy consulting group called The Consortium. In the course of this, Langdon must decipher clues employing allusions to the works of Sandro Botticelli and Dante Alighieri, the writer of The Divine Comedy, and, more importantly, Dante's Inferno.\n\nBibliography\n\nBetween The Da Vinci Code, The Lost Symbol, and Inferno, Langdon is said to have written six books:\n\n*The Symbology of Secret Sects\n*The Art of the Illuminati: Part 1\n*The Lost Language of Ideograms\n*Religious Iconology\n*Symbols of the Lost Sacred Feminine\n*Christian Symbols in the Muslim World\n\nAt that same point in the trilogy, Langdon is preparing the manuscript for his fifth book, to be titled Symbols of the Lost Sacred Feminine. It is later revealed in The Lost Symbol that Symbols of the Lost Sacred Feminine was published and created 'quite a scandal'."

                "A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 · 3, 1 · 1 · 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.\n\nThe property of being prime (or not) is called primality. A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division. It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and \\sqrt{n}. Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers. These include the Miller–Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small probability of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers. , the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits.\n\nThere are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. There is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes, that is to say, the statistical behaviour of primes in the large, can be modelled. The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability that a given, randomly chosen number  is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n.\n\nMany questions regarding prime numbers remain open, such as Goldbach's conjecture (that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes), and the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2). Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains, mainly algebra, such as prime elements and prime ideals.\n\nDefinition and examples\n\nA natural number (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a prime number (or a prime) if it has exactly two positive divisors, 1 and the number itself.  Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite.\n\nAmong the numbers 1 to 6, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are the prime numbers, while 1, 4, and 6 are not prime. 1 is excluded as a prime number, for reasons explained below. 2 is a prime number, since the only natural numbers dividing it are 1 and 2. Next, 3 is prime, too: 1 and 3 do divide 3 without remainder, but 3 divided by 2 gives remainder 1. Thus, 3 is prime. However, 4 is composite, since 2 is another number (in addition to 1 and 4) dividing 4 without remainder:\n4 = 2 · 2.\n5 is again prime: none of the numbers 2, 3, or 4 divide 5. Next, 6 is divisible by 2 or 3, since\n6 = 2 · 3.\nHence, 6 is not prime.  The image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime: . No even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition, any such number  has at least three distinct divisors, namely 1, 2, and . This implies that  is not prime. Accordingly, the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2. Similarly, when written in the usual decimal system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5.\n\nIf  is a natural number, then 1 and  divide  without remainder. Therefore, the condition of being a prime can also be restated as: a number is prime if it is greater than one and if none of\ndivides  (without remainder). Yet another way to say the same is: a number  is prime if it cannot be written as a product of two integers  and , both of which are larger than 1:\n.\nIn other words,  is prime if  items cannot be divided up into smaller equal-size groups of more than one item.\n\nThe set of all primes is often denoted by .\n\nThe first 168 prime numbers (all the prime numbers less than 1000) are:\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541, 547, 557, 563, 569, 571, 577, 587, 593, 599, 601, 607, 613, 617, 619, 631, 641, 643, 647, 653, 659, 661, 673, 677, 683, 691, 701, 709, 719, 727, 733, 739, 743, 751, 757, 761, 769, 773, 787, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 827, 829, 839, 853, 857, 859, 863, 877, 881, 883, 887, 907, 911, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947, 953, 967, 971, 977, 983, 991, 997 .\n\nFundamental theorem of arithmetic\n\nThe crucial importance of prime numbers to number theory and mathematics in general stems from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes in a way that is unique except for the order of the prime factors.  Primes can thus be considered the “basic building blocks” of the natural numbers. For example:\n\nAs in this example, the same prime factor may occur multiple times. A decomposition:\n\nof a number  into (finitely many) prime factors , , ... to  is called prime factorization of . The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can be rephrased so as to say that any factorization into primes will be identical except for the order of the factors. So, albeit there are many prime factorization algorithms to do this in practice for larger numbers, they all have to yield the same result.\n\nIf  is a prime number and  divides a product  of integers, then  divides  or  divides . This proposition is known as Euclid's lemma.   It is used in some proofs of the uniqueness of prime factorizations.\n\nPrimality of one\n\nMost early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number,  so they could not consider it to be a prime. By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number.[https://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/one.html Why is the number one not prime? (from the Prime Pages' list of frequently asked questions) by Chris K. Caldwell.] In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler; however, Euler himself did not consider 1 to be a prime number.   In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime. For example, Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956,  started with 1 as its first prime.  Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime.  By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to arrive at the consensus that 1 is not a prime number, but rather forms its own special category as a \"unit\".\n\nA large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime, but Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic (mentioned above) would not hold as stated. For example, the number 15 can be factored as  and ; if 1 were admitted as a prime, these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers, so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified. Similarly, the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime: a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number 1. Furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function. \n\nHistory\n\nThere are hints in the surviving records of the ancient Egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers: the Egyptian fraction expansions in the Rhind papyrus, for instance, have quite different forms for primes and for composites. However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks. Euclid's Elements (circa 300 BC) contain important theorems about primes, including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime. The Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to Eratosthenes, is a simple method to compute primes, although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way.\n\nAfter the Greeks, little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century. In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated (without proof) Fermat's little theorem (later proved by Leibniz and Euler).  Fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime (they are called Fermat numbers) and he verified this up to n = 4 (or 216 + 1). However, the very next Fermat number 232 + 1 is composite (one of its prime factors is 641), as Euler discovered later, and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime.  The French monk Marin Mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p − 1, with p a prime.  They are called Mersenne primes in his honor.\n\nEuler's work in number theory included many results about primes.  He showed the infinite series Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges| is divergent.\nIn 1747 he showed that the even perfect numbers are precisely the integers of the form 2p−1(2p − 1), where the second factor is a Mersenne prime.\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, Legendre and Gauss independently conjectured that as x tends to infinity, the number of primes up to x is asymptotic to x/ln(x), where ln(x) is the natural logarithm of x.   Ideas of Riemann in his 1859 paper on the zeta-function sketched a program that would lead to a proof of the prime number theorem. This outline was completed by Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin, who independently proved the prime number theorem in 1896.\n\nProving a number is prime is not done (for large numbers) by trial division. Many mathematicians have worked on primality tests for large numbers, often restricted to specific number forms. This includes Pépin's test for Fermat numbers (1877), Proth's theorem (around 1878), the Lucas–Lehmer primality test (originated 1856),  and the generalized Lucas primality test. More recent algorithms like APRT-CL, ECPP, and AKS work on arbitrary numbers but remain much slower.\n\nFor a long time, prime numbers were thought to have extremely limited application outside of pure mathematics.  This changed in the 1970s when the concepts of public-key cryptography were invented, in which prime numbers formed the basis of the first algorithms such as the RSA cryptosystem algorithm.\n\nSince 1951 all the largest known primes have been found by computers. The search for ever larger primes has generated interest outside mathematical circles. The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and other distributed computing projects to find large primes have become popular, while mathematicians continue to struggle with the theory of primes.\n\nNumber of prime numbers\n\nThere are infinitely many prime numbers. Another way of saying this is that the sequence\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...\nof prime numbers never ends. This statement is referred to as Euclid's theorem in honor of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, since the first known proof for this statement is attributed to him. Many more proofs of the infinitude of primes are known, including an analytical proof by Euler, Goldbach's proof based on  Fermat numbers,  Furstenberg's proof using general topology,  and Kummer's elegant proof. \n\nEuclid's proof\n\nEuclid's proof (Book IX, Proposition 20 ) considers any finite set S of primes.  The key idea is to consider the product of all these numbers plus one:\n\n N = 1 + \\prod_{p\\in S} p. \n\nLike any other natural number, N is divisible by at least one prime number (it is possible that N itself is prime).\n\nNone of the primes by which N is divisible can be members of the finite set S of primes with which we started, because dividing N by any one of these leaves a remainder of 1.  Therefore, the primes by which N is divisible are additional primes beyond the ones we started with.  Thus any finite set of primes can be extended to a larger finite set of primes.\n\nIt is often erroneously reported that Euclid begins with the assumption that the set initially considered contains all prime numbers, leading to a contradiction, or that it contains precisely the n smallest primes rather than any arbitrary finite set of primes.   Today, the product of the smallest n primes plus 1 is conventionally called the nth Euclid number.\n\nEuler's analytical proof\n\nEuler's proof uses the partial sums of the reciprocals of primes,\n\nS(p) = \\frac 1 2 + \\frac 1 3 + \\frac 1 5 + \\frac 1 7 + \\cdots + \\frac 1 p.\n\nFor any arbitrary real number x, there exists a prime p for which this partial sum is bigger than x.  This shows that there are infinitely many primes, because if there were finitely many primes the sum would reach its maximum value at the biggest prime rather than being unbounded. More precisely, the growth rate of S(p) is doubly logarithmic, as quantified by Mertens' second theorem.  For comparison, the sum\n\n\\frac 1 {1^2} + \\frac 1 {2^2} + \\frac 1 {3^2} + \\cdots + \\frac 1 {n^2} \\sum_{i\n1}^n \\frac 1 {i^2}\n\ndoes not grow to infinity as n goes to infinity (see Basel problem). In this sense, prime numbers occur more often than squares of natural numbers. Brun's theorem states that the sum of the reciprocals of twin primes,\n\n \\left( {\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5}} \\right) + \\left( {\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{7}} \\right) + \\left( {\\frac{1} + \\frac{1}} \\right) +  \\cdots = \\sum\\limits_{ \\begin{smallmatrix} p \\text{ prime, } \\\\ p + 2 \\text { prime} \\end{smallmatrix}} {\\left( {\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}} \\right)}, \nis finite. Because of Brun's theorem, it is not possible to use Euler's method to solve the twin prime conjecture, that there exist infinitely many twin primes.\n\nTesting primality and integer factorization\n\nThere are various methods to determine whether a given number n is prime. The most basic routine, trial division, is of little practical use because of its slowness. One group of modern primality tests is applicable to arbitrary numbers, while more efficient tests are available for particular numbers. Most such methods only tell whether n is prime or not. Routines also yielding one (or all) prime factors of n are called factorization algorithms.\n\nTrial division\n\nThe most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division. This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer, then n is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if na b is composite (with a and b ≠ 1) then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most \\sqrt{n}. For example, for  n \n 37 , the trial divisions are by  None of these numbers divides 37, so 37 is prime. This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to \\sqrt{n} is known—then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime. For example, to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary (m = 2, 3, and 5), given that 4 and 6 are composite.\n\nWhile a simple method, trial division quickly becomes impractical for testing large integers because the number of possible factors grows too rapidly as n increases. According to the prime number theorem explained below, the number of prime numbers less than \\sqrt{n} is approximately given by \\sqrt{n} / \\ln(\\sqrt{n}), so the algorithm may need up to this number of trial divisions to check the primality of n. For , this number is 450 million—too large for many practical applications.\n\nSieves\n\nAn algorithm yielding all primes up to a given limit, such as required in the primes-only trial division method, is called a prime number sieve. The oldest example, the sieve of Eratosthenes (see above), is still the most commonly used. The sieve of Atkin is another option. Before the advent of computers, lists of primes up to bounds like 107 were also used. \n\nPrimality testing versus primality proving\n\nModern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes, probabilistic (or \"Monte Carlo\") and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not.  For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite.  Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way.  For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number.  If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime.  On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.\n\nA particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test, which relies on the fact (Fermat's little theorem) that np≡n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number.  If we have a number b that we want to test for primality, then we work out nb (mod b) for a random value of n as our test. A flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers (the Carmichael numbers) that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime, so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers.  Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers, though, so this test can be useful for practical purposes.  More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test, such as the Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, and Solovay-Strassen tests, are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number.\n\nDeterministic algorithms do not erroneously report composite numbers as prime. In practice, the fastest such method is known as elliptic curve primality proving. Analyzing its run time is based on heuristic arguments, as opposed to the rigorously proven complexity of the more recent AKS primality test. Deterministic methods are typically slower than probabilistic ones, so the latter ones are typically applied first before a more time-consuming deterministic routine is employed.\n\nThe following table lists a number of prime tests. The running time is given in terms of n, the number to be tested and, for probabilistic algorithms, the number k of tests performed. Moreover, ε is an arbitrarily small positive number, and log is the logarithm to an unspecified base. The big O notation means that, for example, elliptic curve primality proving requires a time that is bounded by a factor (not depending on n, but on ε) times log5+ε(n).\n\nSpecial-purpose algorithms and the largest known prime\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned tests applying to any natural number n, a number of much more efficient primality tests is available for special numbers. For example, to run Lucas' primality test requires the knowledge of the prime factors of , while the Lucas–Lehmer primality test needs the prime factors of  as input. For example, these tests can be applied to check whether\nn! ± 1 = 1 · 2 · 3 · ... · n ± 1\nare prime. Prime numbers of this form are known as factorial primes. Other primes where either p + 1 or p − 1 is of a particular shape include the Sophie Germain primes (primes of the form 2p + 1 with p prime), primorial primes, Fermat primes and Mersenne primes, that is, prime numbers that are of the form , where p is an arbitrary prime. The Lucas–Lehmer test is particularly fast for numbers of this form. This is why the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime since the dawn of electronic computers.\n\nThe following table gives the largest known primes of the mentioned types. Some of these primes have been found using distributed computing. In 2009, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project was awarded a US$100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation also offers $150,000 and $250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits, respectively.  Some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form (that is, no simple formula such as that of Mersenne primes) have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data, converting it to a number n, multiplying it by 256k for some positive integer k, and searching for possible primes within the interval [256kn + 1, 256k(n + 1) − 1].\n\nInteger factorization\n\nGiven a composite integer n, the task of providing one (or all) prime factors is referred to as factorization of n. Elliptic curve factorization is an algorithm relying on arithmetic on an elliptic curve.\n\nDistribution\n\nIn 1975, number theorist Don Zagier commented that primes both\n\nThe distribution of primes in the large, such as the question how many primes are smaller than a given, large threshold, is described by the prime number theorem, but no efficient formula for the n-th prime is known.\n\nThere are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive non-primes, as for every positive integer n the n consecutive integers from (n+1)! + 2 to (n+1)! + n + 1 (inclusive) are all composite (as (n+1)! + k is divisible by k for k between 2 and n + 1).\n\nDirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, in its basic form, asserts that linear polynomials\np(n) = a + bn\\,\nwith coprime integers a and b take infinitely many prime values. Stronger forms of the theorem state that the sum of the reciprocals of these prime values diverges, and that different such polynomials with the same b have approximately the same proportions of primes.\n\nThe corresponding question for quadratic polynomials is less well-understood.\n\nFormulas for primes\n\nThere is no known efficient formula for primes. For example, Mills' theorem and a theorem of Wright assert that there are real constants A>1 and μ such that\n\\left \\lfloor A^{3^{n}}\\right \\rfloor \\text{ and } \\left \\lfloor 2^{\\dots^{2^{2^\\mu}}} \\right \\rfloor\nare prime for any natural number n. Here \\lfloor - \\rfloor represents the floor function, i.e., largest integer not greater than the number in question. The latter formula can be shown using Bertrand's postulate (proven first by Chebyshev), which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n  3. However, computing A or μ requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with.  Another formula is based on Wilson's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.\n\nThere is no non-constant polynomial, even in several variables, that takes only prime values. However, there is a set of Diophantine equations in 9 variables and one parameter with the following property: the parameter is prime if and only if the resulting system of equations has a solution over the natural numbers. This can be used to obtain a single formula with the property that all its positive values are prime. \n\nNumber of prime numbers below a given number\n\nThe prime counting function π(n) is defined as the number of primes not greater than n. For example, π(11) = 5, since there are five primes less than or equal to 11. There are known algorithms to compute exact values of π(n) faster than it would be possible to compute each prime up to n. The prime number theorem states that π(n) is approximately given by\n\\pi(n) \\approx \\frac n {\\ln n},\nin the sense that the ratio of π(n) and the right hand fraction approaches 1 when n grows to infinity. This implies that the likelihood that a number less than n is prime is (approximately) inversely proportional to the number of digits in n. A more accurate estimate for π(n) is given by the offset logarithmic integral\n\\operatorname{Li}(n) = \\int_2^n \\frac{dt}{\\ln t}.\n\nThe prime number theorem also implies estimates for the size of the n-th prime number pn (i.e., p1 2, p2 \n 3, etc.): up to a bounded factor, pn grows like .  In particular, the prime gaps, i.e. the differences  of two consecutive primes, become arbitrarily large. This latter statement can also be seen in a more elementary way by noting that the sequence  (for the notation n! read factorial) consists of  composite numbers, for any natural number n.\n\nArithmetic progressions\n\nAn arithmetic progression is the set of natural numbers that give the same remainder when divided by some fixed number q called modulus. For example,\n3, 12, 21, 30, 39, ...,\nis an arithmetic progression modulo . Except for 3, none of these numbers is prime, since  so that the remaining numbers in this progression are all composite. (In general terms, all prime numbers above q are of the form q#·n + m, where 0 n^2 + n + 41\\,\nyields prime numbers for ,   a fact leading into deep algebraic number theory: more specifically, Heegner numbers. For greater n, the expression also produces composite values. The Hardy-Littlewood conjecture F makes an asymptotic prediction about the density of primes among the values of quadratic polynomials (with integer coefficients a, b, and c),\nf(n) = a x^2 + bx + c ,\nin terms of Li(n) and the coefficients a, b, and c. However, progress has been difficult. No quadratic polynomial (with ) is known to take infinitely many prime values. The Ulam spiral depicts all natural numbers in a spiral-like way. Primes cluster on certain diagonals and not others, suggesting that some quadratic polynomials take prime values more often than others.\n\nOpen questions\n\nZeta function and the Riemann hypothesis\n\nThe Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is defined as an infinite sum\n\\zeta(s)\\sum_{n\n1}^\\infin \\frac{1}{n^s},\nwhere s is a complex number with real part bigger than 1. It is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that this sum agrees with the infinite product\n\\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} \\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}.\nThe zeta function is closely related to prime numbers. For example, the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function: if there were only finitely many primes then ζ(1) would have a finite value. However, the harmonic series  diverges (i.e., exceeds any given number), so there must be infinitely many primes. Another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity (Basel problem), due to Euler,\n\\zeta(2) \\prod_{p} \\frac{1}{1-p^{-2}}\n \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}.\nThe reciprocal of ζ(2), 6/π2, is the probability that two numbers selected at random are relatively prime.  \n\nThe unproven Riemann hypothesis, dating from 1859, states that except for  all zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal to 1/2. The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible. From a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise. From a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes (about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes, the prime number theorem) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x (for intervals near x). This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct. In particular, the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason.\n\nOther conjectures\n\nIn addition to the Riemann hypothesis, many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed. Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades: all four of Landau's problems from 1912 are still unsolved. One of them is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes. , this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to .  Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes. Also, any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes.  The branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory.\n\nOther conjectures deal with the question whether an infinity of prime numbers subject to certain constraints exists. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Fibonacci primes  and infinitely many Mersenne primes, but not Fermat primes.  It is not known whether or not there are an infinite number of Wieferich primes and of prime Euclid numbers.\n\nA third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture). Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n.  It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1.  These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n. It is implied by the stronger Cramér's conjecture.\n\nApplications\n\nFor a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly. In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.  However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms. Prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.\n\nSome rotor machines were designed with a different number of pins on each rotor, with the number of pins on any one rotor either prime, or coprime to the number of pins on any other rotor. This helped generate the full cycle of possible rotor positions before repeating any position.\n\nThe International Standard Book Numbers work with a check digit, which exploits the fact that 11 is a prime.\n\nArithmetic modulo a prime and finite fields\n\nModular arithmetic modifies usual arithmetic by only using the numbers\n\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1 \\}, \\,\nwhere n is a fixed natural number called modulus.\nCalculating sums, differences and products is done as usual, but whenever a negative number or a number greater than n − 1 occurs, it gets replaced by the remainder after division by n. For instance, for n = 7, the sum 3 + 5 is 1 instead of 8, since 8 divided by 7 has remainder 1. This is referred to by saying \"3 + 5 is congruent to 1 modulo 7\" and is denoted\n3 + 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7.\nSimilarly, 6 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7), 2 − 5 ≡ 4 (mod 7), since −3 + 7 = 4, and 3 · 4 ≡ 5 (mod 7) as 12 has remainder 5. Standard properties of addition and multiplication  familiar from the integers remain valid in modular arithmetic. In the parlance of abstract algebra, the above set of integers, which is also denoted Z/nZ, is therefore a commutative ring for any n.\nDivision, however, is not in general possible in this setting. For example, for n = 6, the equation\n\n3 \\cdot x \\equiv 2 \\pmod 6,\n\na solution x of which would be an analogue of 2/3, cannot be solved, as one can see by calculating 3 · 0, ..., 3 · 5 modulo 6. The distinctive feature of prime numbers is the following: division is possible in modular arithmetic if and only if n is a prime. Equivalently, n is prime if and only if all integers m satisfying  are coprime to n, i.e. their only common divisor is one. Indeed, for n = 7, the equation\n3 \\cdot x \\equiv 2 \\ \\ (\\operatorname{mod}\\ 7),\nhas a unique solution, . Because of this, for any prime p, Z/pZ (also denoted Fp) is called a field or, more specifically, a finite field since it contains finitely many, namely p, elements.\n\nA number of theorems can be derived from inspecting Fp in this abstract way. For example, Fermat's little theorem, stating\na^{p-1} \\equiv 1 (\\operatorname{mod}\\ p)\nfor any integer a not divisible by p, may be proved using these notions. This implies\n\\sum_{a=1}^{p-1} a^{p-1} \\equiv (p-1) \\cdot 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod p.\nGiuga's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime. Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is  or a divisor of .  The fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p − 1)! + 1 is divisible by p. Moreover, an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n − 1)! is divisible by n.\n\nFermat primes and constructible polygons\n\nFermat primes are primes of the form\n,\nwith k a natural number. They are named after Pierre de Fermat, who conjectured that all such numbers are prime. This was based on the evidence of the first five numbers in this series—3, 5, 17, 257, and 65,537—being prime. However, F5 is composite and so are all other Fermat numbers that have been verified as of 2015. A regular n-gon is constructible using straightedge and compass if and only if the odd prime factors of n (if any) are distinct Fermat primes.\n\nOther mathematical occurrences of primes\n\nMany mathematical domains make great use of prime numbers. An example from the theory of finite groups are the Sylow theorems: if G is a finite group and pn is the highest power of the prime p that divides the order of G, then G has a subgroup of order pn. Also, any group of prime order is cyclic (Lagrange's theorem).\n\nPublic-key cryptography\n\nSeveral public-key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA and the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (2048-bit primes are common). RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (i.e., more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers x and y than to calculate x and y (assumed coprime) if only the product xy is known. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation, while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to be a hard problem.\n\nPrime numbers in nature\n\nThe evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada make use of prime numbers.  These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas.  If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.  Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.\n\nThere is speculation that the zeros of the zeta function are connected to the energy levels of complex quantum systems. \n\nGeneralizations\n\nThe concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, \"prime\" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name.  Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.  Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.\n\nPrime elements in rings\n\nPrime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring R, an algebraic structure where addition, subtraction and multiplication are defined: prime elements and irreducible elements. An element p of R is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a unit (i.e., does not have a multiplicative inverse) and satisfies the following requirement: given x and y in R such that p divides the product xy, then p divides x or y. An element is irreducible if it is not a unit and cannot be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units. In the ring Z of integers, the set of prime elements equals the set of irreducible elements, which is\n\n\\{ \\dots, -11, -7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \\dots \\}\\, .\n\nIn any ring R, any prime element is irreducible. The converse does not hold in general, but does hold for unique factorization domains.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains. An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers Z[i], that is, the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes. Not every prime (in Z) is a Gaussian prime: in the bigger ring Z[i], 2 factors into the product of the two Gaussian primes (1 + i) and (1 − i). Rational primes (i.e. prime elements in Z) of the form 4k + 3 are Gaussian primes, whereas rational primes of the form 4k + 1 are not.\n\nPrime ideals\n\nIn ring theory, the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal. Prime ideals, which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals (0), (2), (3), (5), (7), (11), … The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the Lasker–Noether theorem, which expresses every ideal in a Noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals, which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers. \n\nPrime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects, via the notion of the spectrum of a ring.  Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry. Such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations\nx^2 \\equiv p \\ \\ (\\text{mod } q),\\,\nwhere x is an integer and p and q are (usual) prime numbers.  Early attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem climaxed when Kummer introduced regular primes, primes satisfying a certain requirement concerning the failure of unique factorization in the ring consisting of expressions\na_0 + a_1 \\zeta + \\cdots + a_{p-1} \\zeta^{p-1}\\, , \nwhere a0, ..., ap−1 are integers and ζ is a complex number such that root of unity|. \n\nValuations\n\nValuation theory studies certain functions from a field K to the real numbers R called valuations.   Every such valuation yields a topology on K, and two valuations are called equivalent if they yield the same topology. A prime of K (sometimes called a place of K) is an equivalence class of valuations. For example, the p-adic valuation of a rational number q is defined to be the integer vp(q), such that\nq = p^{v_p(q)} \\frac {r}{s},\nwhere both r and s are not divisible by p. For example,  The p-adic norm is defined asSome sources also put \\left| q \\right|_p :\n e^{-v_p(q)}. \\,.\n\\left| q \\right|_p := p^{-v_p(q)}. \\,\nIn particular, this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p, in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime). While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |−|p yields the field of p-adic numbers.  These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q, by Ostrowski's theorem. Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed (or local) fields. This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.\n\nIn the arts and literature\n\nPrime numbers have influenced many artists and writers.  The French composer Olivier Messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through \"natural phenomena\". In works such as La Nativité du Seigneur (1935) and Quatre études de rythme (1949–50), he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47  and 53 appear in the third étude, \"Neumes rythmiques\". According to Messiaen this way of composing was \"inspired by the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations\". \n\nIn his science fiction novel Contact, NASA scientist Carl Sagan suggested that prime numbers could be used as a means of communicating with aliens, an idea that he had first developed informally with American astronomer Frank Drake in 1975.  In the novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon, the narrator arranges the sections of the story by consecutive prime numbers. \n\nMany films, such as Cube, Sneakers, The Mirror Has Two Faces and A Beautiful Mind reflect a popular fascination with the mysteries of prime numbers and cryptography.  Prime numbers are used as a metaphor for loneliness and isolation in the Paolo Giordano novel The Solitude of Prime Numbers, in which they are portrayed as \"outsiders\" among integers."

                "question 1B: October 2010\nExamine the history of the development of the atom. We have already discussed the\nmajor players in the development of the atom. Pick out at least 8 major players who\nhelped aid in the development of the concept of the atom. Then explain each\nexperiment in a concise explanation. Then explain how each one aided in the\ndevelopment of the next or how their concept assisted in the further development of the current quantum model of the atom.\nJ.J. Thomson\nBeginning in 1895 physicist J. J. Thomson theorized that cathode rays produced in Crookes' tubes must be composed of what he called \"corpuscles\", a single type of negatively charged particle. In 1897, applying his own vacuum technique to the study of these then-mysterious rays, Thomson made a convincing argument for composition based on sub-atomic particles, \"this matter being the substance from which all the chemical elements are built up\".\nTo make sense of this theory he proposed a \"plum pudding model\" of the atom, which was debated for several years and disproved by his former student, Ernest Rutherford. Thomson also showed a stream of channel rays could be separated into two or more parts through exposure to electrical and magnetic fields, leading eventually to the invention of the mass spectrograph and discovery of isotopes by another of Thomson's students, Francis W. Aston. Thomson won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906, and his son, physicist George Paget Thomson, won the same honor in 1937.\nTHOMSON’S FIRST CATHODE RAY EXPERIMENT\nThomson had an inkling that the ‘rays’ emitted from the electron gun were inseparable from the latent charge, and decided to try and prove this by using a magnetic field.\nHis first experiment was to build a cathode ray tube with a metal cylinder on the end. This cylinder had two slits in it, leading to electrometers, which could measure small electric charges.\nHe found that by applying a magnetic field across the tube, there was no activity recorded by the electrometers and so the charge had been bent away by the magnet. This proved that the negative charge and the ray were inseparable and intertwined.\nTHOMSON’S CATHODE RAY SECOND EXPERIMENT\nLike all great scientists, he did not stop there, and developed the second stage of the experiment, to prove that the rays carried a negative charge. To prove this hypothesis, he attempted to deflect them with an electric field.\nEarlier experiments had failed to back this up, but Thomson thought that the vacuum in the tube was not good enough, and found ways to improve greatly the quality.\nFor this, he constructed a slightly different cathode ray tube, with a fluorescent coating at one end and a near perfect vacuum. Halfway down the tube were two electric plates, producing a positive anode and a negative cathode, which he hoped would deflect the rays.\nAs he expected, the rays were deflected by the electric charge, proving beyond doubt that the rays were made up of charged particles carrying a negative charge. This result was a major discovery in itself, but Thomson resolved to understand more about the nature of these particles.\nTHOMSON’S THIRD EXPERIMENT\nThe third experiment was a brilliant piece of scientific deduction and shows how a series of experiments can gradually uncover truths.\nMany great scientific discoveries involve performing a series of interconnected experiments, gradually accumulating data and proving a hypothesis.\nHe decided to try to work out the nature of the particles. They were too small to have their mass or charge calculated directly, but he attempted to deduce this from how much the particles were bent by electrical currents, of varying strengths.\nThomson found out that the charge to mass ratio was so large that the particles either carried a huge charge, or were a thousand time smaller than a hydrogen ion. He decided upon the latter and came up with the idea that the cathode rays were made of particles that emanated from with the atoms themselves, a very bold and innovative idea.\nLATER DEVELOPMENTS\nThomson came up with the initial idea for the structure of the atom, postulating that it consisted of these negatively charged particles swimming in a sea of positive charge. His pupil, Rutherford, developed the idea and came up with the theory that the atom consisted of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by orbiting tiny negative particles, which he called electrons.\nQuantum physics has shown things to be a little more complex than this but all quantum physicists owe their legacy to Thomson. Although atoms were known about, as apparently indivisible elementary particles, he was the first to postulate that they had a complicated internal structure.\nThomson’s greatest gift to physics was not his experiments, but the next generation of great scientists who studied under him, including Rutherford, Oppenheimer and Aston. These great minds were inspired by him, marking him out as one of the grandfathers of modern physics.\nJohn Dalton\nIt was in the early 1800s that John Dalton, an observer of weather and discoverer of color blindness among other things, came up with his atomic theory. Let's set the stage for Dalton's work. Less than twenty years earlier, in the 1780's, Lavoisier ushered in a new chemical era by making careful quantitative measurements which allowed the compositions of compounds to be determined with accuracy. By 1799 enough data had been accumulated for Proust to establish the Law of Constant Composition ( also called the Law of Definite Proportions). In 1803 Dalton noted that oxygen and carbon combined to make two compounds. Of course, each had its own particular weight ratio of oxygen to carbon (1.33:1 and 2.66:1), but also, for the same amount of carbon, one had exactly twice as much oxygen as the other. This led him to propose the Law of Simple Multiple Proportions, which was later verified by the Swedish chemist Berzelius. In an attempt to explain how and why elements would combine with one another in fixed ratios and sometimes also in multiples of those ratios, Dalton formulated his atomic theory.\nThe idea of atoms had been proposed much earlier. The ancient Greek philosophers had talked about atoms, but Dalton's theory was different in that it had the weight of careful chemical measurements behind it. It wasn't just a philosophical statement that there are atoms because there must be atoms. His atomic theory, stated that elements consisted of tiny particles called atoms. He said that the reason an element is pure is because all atoms of an element were identical and that in particular they had the same mass. He also said that the reason elements differed from one another was that atoms of each element were different from one another; in particular, they had different masses. He also said that compounds consisted of atoms of different elements combined together. Compounds are pure substances (remember they cannot be separated into elements by phase changes) because the atoms of different elements are bonded to one another somehow, perhaps by hooks, and are not easily separated from one another. Compounds have constant composition because they contain a fixed ratio of atoms and each atom has its own characteristic weight, thus fixing the weight ratio of one element to the other. In addition he said that chemical reactions involved the rearrangement of combinations of those atoms.\nSo that, briefly, is Dalton's theory. With modifications, it has stood up pretty well to the criteria that we talked about earlier. It did not convince everyone right away however. Although a number of chemists were quickly convinced of the truth of the theory, it took about a half century for the opposition to die down, or perhaps I should say die off.\nLet me point out again the difference between a model of atoms and a theory of atoms. A model focuses on describing what the atoms are like, whereas the theory not only talks about what the atoms are like but how they interact with one another and so forth. Dalton's model was that the atoms were tiny, indivisible, indestructible particles and that each one had a certain mass, size, and chemical behavior that was determined by what kind of element they were. We will use that model of an atom for now, but we will modify it considerably in a later lesson.\nErnest Rutherford\nThe Discovery of Radioactivity (Ernest Rutherford)- In 1899 Ernest Rutherford studied the absorption of radioactivity by thin sheets of metal foil and found two components: alpha (a) radiation, which is absorbed by a few thousandths of a centimeter of metal foil, and beta (b) radiation, which can pass through 100 times as much foil before it was absorbed. Shortly thereafter, a third form of radiation, named gamma (g) rays, was discovered that can penetrate as much as several centimeters of lead.\nThe Gold Foil Experiment (Ernest Rutherford)- Rutherford began his graduate work by studying the effect of x-rays on various materials. Shortly after the discovery of radioactivity, he turned to the study of the -particles emitted by uranium metal and its compounds.\nBefore he could study the effect of -particles on matter, Rutherford had to develop a way of counting individual -particles. He found that a screen coated with zinc sulfide emitted a flash of light each time it was hit by an -particle. Rutherford and his assistant, Hans Geiger, would sit in the dark until his eyes became sensitive enough. They would then try to count the flashes of light given off by the ZnS screen. (It is not surprising that Geiger was motivated to develop the electronic radioactivity counter that carries his name.)\nRutherford found that a narrow beam of -particles was broadened when it passed through a thin film of mica or metal. He therefore had Geiger measure the angle through which these -particles were scattered by a thin piece of metal foil. Because it is unusually ductile, gold can be made into a foil that is only 0.00004 cm thick. When this foil was bombarded with -particles, Geiger found that the scattering was small, on the order of one degree.\nThese results were consistent with Rutherford's expectations. He knew that the -particle had a considerable mass and moved quite rapidly. He therefore anticipated that virtually all of the -particles would be able to penetrate the metal foil, although they would be scattered slightly by collisions with the atoms through which they passed. In other words, Rutherford expected the -particles to pass through the metal foil the way a rifle bullet would penetrate a bag of sand.\nOne day, Geiger suggested that a research project should be given to Ernest Marsden, who was working in Rutherford's laboratory. Rutherford responded, \"Why not let him see whether any -particles can be scattered through a large angle?\" When this experiment was done, Marsden found that a small fraction (perhaps 1 in 20,000) of the -particles were scattered through angles larger than 90o (see Figure 6.7a). Many years later, reflecting on his reaction to these results, Rutherford said: \"It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.\"\nRutherford concluded that there was only one way to explain these results. He assumed that the positive charge and the mass of an atom are concentrated in a small fraction of the total volume and then derived mathematical equations for the scattering that would occur. These equations predicted that the number of -particles scattered through a given angle should be proportional to the thickness of the foil and the square of the charge on the nucleus, and inversely proportional to the velocity with which the -particles moved raised to the fourth power. In a series of experiments, Geiger and Marsden verified each of these predictions.\nWhen he published the results of these experiments in 1911, Rutherford proposed a model for the structure of the atom that is still accepted today. He concluded that all of the positive charge and essentially all of the mass of the atom is concentrated in an infinitesimally small fraction of the total volume of the atom, which he called the nucleus (from the Latin for little nut).\nMost of the -particles were able to pass through the gold foil without encountering anything large enough to significantly deflect their path. A small fraction of the -particles came close to the nucleus of a gold atom as they passed through the foil. When this happened, the force of repulsion between the positively charged -particle and the nucleus deflected the -particle by a small angle. Occasionally, an -particle traveled along a path that would eventually lead to a direct collision with the nucleus of one of the 2000 or so atoms it had to pass through. When this happened, repulsion between the nucleus and the -particle deflected the -particle through an angle of 90o or more.\nBy carefully measuring the fraction of the -particles deflected through large angles, Rutherford was able to estimate the size of the nucleus. According to his calculations, the radius of the nucleus is at least 10,000 times smaller than the radius of the atom. The vast majority of the volume of an atom is therefore empty space.\nNaming the Proton (Ernest Rutherford)- Shortly after the World War I, in 1920, Rutherford proposed the name proton for the positively charged particles in the nucleus of an atom.\nProposing the Neutron (Ernest Rutherford)- At the same time that Rutherford proposed the name proton for the positively charged particle in the nucleus of an atom, he proposed that the nucleus also contained a neutral particle, eventually named the neutron. It was not until 1932, however, that James Chadwick was able to prove that these neutral particles exist.\nPierre and Marie Curie\nPierre and Marie Curie are best known for their pioneering work in the study of radioactivity, which led to their discovery in 1898 of the elements radium and polonium. He discovered the phenomenon of piezoelectricity, whereby changes in the volume of certain crystals excite small electric potentials. Along with work on crystal symmetry, Pierre Curie studied the magnetic properties of materials and constructed a torsion balance with a tolerance of 0.01 mg. He discovered that the magnetic susceptibility of paramagnetic materials is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (Weiss-Curie's law) and that there exists a critical temperature above which the magnetic properties disappear (Curie temperature). Marie measured the strength of the radiation emitted from uranium compounds and found it proportional to the uranium content, constant over a long period of time, and uninfluenced by external conditions. She detected a similar immutable radiation in the compounds of thorium. While checking these results, she made the unexpected discovery that uranium pitchblende and the mineral chalcolite emitted about four times as much radiation as could be expected from their uranium content. In 1898 she therefore drew the revolutionary conclusion that pitchblende contains a small amount of an unknown radiating element.\nNiels Bohr\nA model of the atom, first described by Niels Bohr, that explains the emission and absorption of radiation as transitions between stationary electronic states in which the electron orbits the nucleus at a definite distance. The Bohr model violates the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, since it postulates definite paths and momenta for electrons as they move around the nucleus. Modern theories usually use atomic orbitals to describe the behavior of electrons in atoms. The Bohr Model is probably familar as the \"planetary model\" of the atom illustrated in the adjacent figure that, for example, is used as a symbol for atomic energy (a bit of a misnomer, since the energy in \"atomic energy\" is actually the energy of the nucleus, rather than the entire atom). In the Bohr Model the neutrons and protons (symbolized by red and blue balls in the adjacent image) occupy a dense central region called the nucleus, and the electrons orbit the nucleus much like planets orbiting the Sun (but the orbits are not confined to a plane as is approximately true in the Solar System). The adjacent image is not to scale since in the realistic case the radius of the nucleus is about 100,000 times smaller than the radius of the entire atom, and as far as we can tell electrons are point particles without a physical extent. This similarity between a planetary model and the Bohr Model of the atom ultimately arises because the attractive gravitational force in a solar system and the attractive Coulomb (electrical) force between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons in an atom are mathematically of the same form. (The form is the same, but the intrinsic strength of the Coulomb interaction is much larger than that of the gravitational interaction; in addition, there are positive and negative electrical charges so the Coulomb interaction can be either attractive or repulsive, but gravitation is always attractive in our present Universe.)\nHenry Mosley\nBefore Moseley and his created law, atomic numbers had been thought of as a semi-arbitrary ordering number, vaguely increasing with atomic weight but not strictly defined by it. Moseley redefined the idea of atomic numbers from its previous status as an ad hoc numerical tag to help sorting the elements, in particular in the Periodic Table, into a real and objective whole-number quantity that was experimentally measurable. Furthermore, as noted by Bohr, Moseley's law provided a reasonably complete experimental set of data that supported the conception by Ernest Rutherford and Antonius Van den Broek of the atom, with a positively-charged nucleus surrounded by negatively-charged electrons in which the atomic number is understood to be the exactly physical number of positive charges in the central atomic nuclei of the elements. Simple modification of Rydberg's and Bohr's formulas were found to give theoretical justification for Moseley's empirically-derived law for determining atomic numbers. The atomic number is one of the most important things of an atom. It has helped us understand so much about current atoms. His discovery was a very important and useful discovery.\nJames Chadwick\nIn 1932, English Physicist James Chadwick, after a decade-long struggle to track down this tricky particle (all the methods available at the time were used only to detect charged particles), performed tests on a new type of radiation which had been baffling physicists for years, and which had previously been mistaken for “gamma rays” (a form of radiation consisting of high-energy photons).\nThe test, to simplify as much as possible, went like this:\nA sample of Beryllium was bombarded with alpha particles (another type of naturally occurring radiation which are technically just ionized helium nuclei), which causes it to emit this mysterious radiation. It was then discovered by Irene Joliot-Curie (daughter of Marie and Pierre Curie) and her husband Frederic Joliot-Curie that this radiation, upon striking a proton-rich surface (paraffin was the preferred example), would discharge some of the protons, which could then be detected using a Geiger counter (a device that measures radiation).\nThis was the premise, and from here, Chadwick simply had to play detective and put all the pieces of the puzzle together. For instance, he could tell that the mysterious radiation in question was neutral due to the fact that it was not affected by proximity to a magnetic field, and, unlike standard gamma radiation, did not invoke the photoelectric effect (when photons, such as gamma rays, strike certain surfaces, they discharge electrons, which can be simply measured), but rather discharged protons, which meant that the particles had to be more massive than previously expected.\nIn the end, Chadwick finally solved the puzzle and officially discovered the neutron in 1932, thus vindicating Rutherford’s original theory (not that Rutherford needed any more accomplishments in his already prolific scientific career). For his efforts, Chadwick received the Nobel Prize in 1935.\nDemocritus\nThe ancient philosopher, Heraclitus, maintained that everything is in a state of flux. Nothing escapes change of some sort (it is impossible to step into the same river). On the other hand, Parmenides argued that everything is what it is, so that it cannot become what is not (change is impossible because a substance would have to transition through nothing to become something else, which is a logical contradiction). Thus, change is incompatible with being so that only the permanent aspects of the Universe could be considered real.\nAn ingenious escape was proposed in the fifth century B.C. by Democritus. He hypothesized that all matter (plus space and time) is composed of tiny indestructible units, called atoms. This idea seems motivated by the question of how finely one can go on cutting up matter. While Democritus performed no experiments and had only the flimsiest evidence for postulating the existence of atoms, his theory was kept alive by the Roman poet Lucretius which survived the Dark Ages to be discovered in 1417. The atoms in Democritus theory themselves remain unchanged, but move about in space to combine in various ways to form all macroscopic objects. Early atomic theory stated that the characteristics of an object are determined by the shape of its atoms. So, for example, sweet things are made of smooth atoms, bitter things are made of sharp atoms.\nIn this manner permanence and flux are reconciled and the field of atomic physics was born. Although Democritus' ideas were to solve a philosophical dilemma, the fact that there is some underlying, elemental substance to the Universe is a primary driver in modern physics, the search for the ultimate subatomic particle.\nPosted by\nDustin George\nDemocritus:\nA Greek philosopher who theorized that all matter consisted of tiny particles that he called atoms, a name derived from two Greek words meaning indivisible. He proposed the earliest views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms. He reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded to the shape of the atoms involved. Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials. Democritus was the main proponent of this view. Using analogies from our sense experiences, he gave a picture or an image of an atom that distinguished them from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts. Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with hooks and eyes others with balls and sockets.\nHis contributions broke open the world of the atom.\nJoseph Proust:\nA French chemist and apothecary who came up with the Law of Definite Proportions which states that a chemical compound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by mass. Proust studied copper carbonate, the two tin oxides,and the two iron sulfides to prove this law. He did this by making artificial copper carbonate and comparing it to natural copper carbonate. With this he showed that each had the same proportion of weights between the three elements involved (Cu, C, O). Between the two types of the other compounds, Proust showed that no intermediate indeterminate compounds exist between them.\nHis law was adapted as part of Dalton's Theory.\nJohn Dalton:\nAn English chemist, meteorologist, and physicist who theorized that:\n1.Elements are made of tiny particles called atoms.\n2.The atoms of a given element are different from those of any other element; the atoms of different elements can be distinguished from one another by their respective relative atomic weights.\n3.All atoms of a given element are identical.\n4.Atoms of one element can combine with atoms of other elements to form chemical compounds; a given compound always has the same relative numbers of types of atoms.\n5.Atoms cannot be created, divided into smaller particles, nor destroyed in the chemical process; a chemical reaction simply changes the way atoms are grouped together.\nHe reached this theory after a series of experiments that included the analysis of a number of pure compounds and the study of gases.\nJohn Dalton contributed an early understanding of the behavior of atoms that has had to be refined a little bit sense his stating it.\nJ.J. Thomson:\nA British physicist who discovered the electron in 1897, the first subatomic particle discovered. Thomson discovered this through his explorations on the properties of cathode rays. Thomson found that the rays could be deflected by an electric field . By comparing the deflection of a beam of cathode rays by electric and magnetic fields he was able to measure the particle's mass. This showed that cathode rays were matter, but he found that the particles were about 2000 times lighter than the mass of the lightest atom, hydrogen. He concluded that the rays were composed of very light negatively charged particles which he called \"corpuscles\".\nHis experiments were the first to introduce a subatomic particle, opening the way for more.\nErnest Rutherford :\nA New Zealand-British chemist and physicist who discovered Protons. He discovered this through an experiment where a beam of alpha particles, generated by the radioactive decay of radium, was directed normally onto a sheet of very thin gold foil. The gold foil was surrounded by a circular sheet of zinc sulfide (ZnS) which was used as a detector: the ZnS sheet would light up when hit with alpha particles. Under the prevailing plum pudding model, the alpha particles should all have been deflected by, at most, a few degrees; measuring the pattern of scattered particles was expected to provide information about the distribution of charge within the atom. However they observed that a very small percentage of particles were deflected through angles much larger than 90 degrees. Through this experiment he was able to say that there had to be a nucleus where a large amount of the atom's charge and mass is concentrated into a very physically-small (as compared with the size of the atom) region. He also theorized about the existence of neutrons.\nHis discovery of the proton opened the way for a neutrally charged particle to balance it.\nJames Chadwick:\nAn Englishman who discovered the neutron. His experiment was based on the 1930 discovery that Beryllium, when bombarded by alpha particles, emitted a very energetic stream of radiation. This stream was originally thought to be gamma radiation. However, further investigations into the properties of the radiation revealed contradictory results. Like gamma rays, these rays were extremely penetrating and since they were not deflected upon passing through a magnetic field, neutral. However, unlike gamma rays, these rays did not discharge charged electroscopes (the photoelectric effect). Irene Curie and her husband discovered that when a beam of this radiation hit a substance rich in protons, for example paraffin, protons were knocked loose which could be easily detected by a Geiger counter.\nIn 1932, Chadwick proposed that this particle was Rutherford's neutron. Using kinematics, Chadwick was able to determine the velocity of the protons. Then through conservation of momentum techniques, he was able to determine that the mass of the neutral radiation was almost exactly the same as that of a proton.\nHis discovery completed the knowledge of the main subatomic particles in the atom today.\nNiels Bohr:\nA Danish physicist who made fundamental contributions to understanding atomic structure, he is most credited with the Bohr Atomic Model. He published this model introducing the theory of electrons traveling in orbits around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of the element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits. He reached this model by adapting Rutherford's nuclear structure to Max Planck's quantum theory.\nHis model of the atom is still used as a basic model today and started the process toward the Quantum Model.\nCarl David Anderson :\nAn American physicist who discovered the positron. He began investigations into cosmic rays during the course of which he encountered unexpected particle tracks in his cloud chamber photographs that he correctly interpreted as having been created by a particle with the same mass as the electron, but with opposite electrical charge. This discovery, announced in 1932 and later confirmed by others, validated Paul Dirac's theoretical prediction of the existence of the positron. Anderson obtained the first direct proof that positrons existed by shooting gamma rays produced by the natural radioactive nuclide ThC'' (208Tl) into other materials, resulting in creation of positron-electron pairs.\nHis contributions proved the existance of antimatter and adds to the understanding of how atoms behave.\nPosted by\nLindsey Kunze\nExamine the history of the development of the atom. We have already discussed the major players in the development of the atom. Pick out at least 8 major players who helped aid in the development of the concept of the atom. Then explain each experiment in a concise explanation. Then explain how each one aided in the development of the next or how their concept assisted in the further development of the current quantum model of the atom.\nDemocritus: He opposed the atomic theory, but in doing so he summarized its principal doctrines. Thus he attributed to Leucippus the ideas that the atoms are \"infinite in number and imperceptible because of the minuteness of their size. They move about in empty space (for there is empty space) and by joining together they produce perceptible objects, which are destroyed when the atoms separate. according to Democritus, the atom was the irreducibly minimal quantity of matter. The concept of the infinite divisibility of matter was flatly contradicted by the atomic theory, since within the interior of the atom there could be no physical parts or unoccupied space. Every atom was exactly like every other atom as a piece of corporeal stuff. But the atoms differed in shape, and since their contours showed an infinite variety and could be oriented in any direction and arranged in any order, the atoms could enter into countless combinations. In their solid interior there was no motion, while they themselves could move about in empty space. Thus, for the atomic theory, the physical universe had two basic ingredients: impenetrable atoms and penetrable space. For Democritus, space was infinite in extent, and the atoms were infinite in number. By their very nature the atoms were endowed with a motion that was eternal and not initiated by any outside force. Since the atoms were not created at any time in the past and would never disintegrate at any time in the future, the total quantity of matter in the universe remained constant: this fundamental principle of Democritus's atomic theory implies the conservation of matter, the sum total of which in the universe neither increases nor diminishes. Though Democritus's conception of the atom has been modified in several essential respects in modern times, his atomic theory remains the foundation of modern science.

He said that the reason an element is pure is because all atoms of an element were identical and that in particular they had the same mass. He also said that the reason elements differed from one another was that atoms of each element were different from one another; in particular, they had different masses. He also said that compounds consisted of atoms of different elements combined together.

Compounds have constant composition because they contain a fixed ratio of atoms and each atom has its own characteristic weight, thus fixing the weight ratio of one element to the other. In addition he said that chemical reactions involved the rearrangement of combinations of those atoms.\nDmitri Mendeleev: Mendeleev's original work covered a wide range, from questions in applied chemistry to the most general problems of chemical and physical theory. His name is best known for his work on the Periodic Law. Various chemists had traced numerical sequences among the atomic weights of some of the elements and noted connections between them and the properties of the different substances; but it was left to him to give a full expression to the generalization, and to treat it not merely as a system of classifying the elements according to certain observed facts, but as a \"law of nature\" which could be relied upon to predict new facts and to disclose errors in what were supposed to be old facts. Thus in 1871 he was led by certain gaps in his tables to assert the existence of three new elements so far unknown to the chemist, and to assign them definite properties. These three he called ekaboron, ekaaluminium, and ekasilicon; and his prophecy was completely vindicated within fifteen years by the discovery of gallium in 1871, scandium in 1879, and germanium in 1886. Again, in several cases he ventured to question the correctness of the \"accepted atomic weights\", on the ground that they did not correspond with the Periodic Law, and here also he was justified by subsequent investigation. In 1902, in an attempt at a chemical conception of the ether, he put forward the hypothesis that there are in existence two elements of smaller atomic weight than hydrogen, and that the lighter of these is a chemically inert, exceedingly mobile, all-penetrating and all-pervading gas, which constitutes the \"aether.\" Mendeleev also devoted much study to the nature of such \"indefinite\" compounds as solutions, which he looked upon as homogeneous liquid systems of unstable dissociating compounds of the solvent with the substance dissolved, holding the opinion that they are merely an instance of ordinary definite or atomic compounds, subject to John Dalton's laws. In another department of physical chemistry he investigated the expansion of liquids with heat, and devised a formula for its expression similar to Gay-Lussac's law of the uniformity of the expansion of gases, while so far back as 1861 he anticipated T. Andrews's conception of the critical temperature of gases by defining the absolute boiling-point of a substance as the temperature at which cohesion and heat of vaporization become equal to zero and the liquid changes to vapor, irrespective of the pressure and volume. Mendeleev wrote largely on chemical topics, his most widely known book probably being The Principles of Chemistry, which was written in 1868-70, and has gone through many subsequent editions in various languages. For his work on the Periodic Law he was awarded in 1882, at the same time as L. Meyer, the Davy medal of the Royal Society, and in 1905 he received its Copley medal. He died at St. Petersburg on the 2nd of February 1907.\nPierre and Marie Curie: Pierre and Marie Curie are best known for their pioneering work in the study of radioactivity, which led to their discovery in 1898 of the elements radium and polonium. He discovered the phenomenon of piezoelectricity, whereby changes in the volume of certain crystals excite small electric potentials. Along with work on crystal symmetry, Pierre Curie studied the magnetic properties of materials and constructed a torsion balance with a tolerance of 0.01 mg. He discovered that the magnetic susceptibility of paramagnetic materials is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (Weiss-Curie's law) and that there exists a critical temperature above which the magnetic properties disappear (Curie temperature). Marie measured the strength of the radiation emitted from uranium compounds and found it proportional to the uranium content, constant over a long period of time, and uninfluenced by external conditions. She detected a similar immutable radiation in the compounds of thorium. While checking these results, she made the unexpected discovery that uranium pitchblende and the mineral chalcolite emitted about four times as much radiation as could be expected from their uranium content. In 1898 she therefore drew the revolutionary conclusion that pitchblende contains a small amount of an unknown radiating element.\nErnest Rutherford: In 1899 Ernest Rutherford studied the absorption of radioactivity by thin sheets of metal foil and found two components: alpha (a) radiation, which is absorbed by a few thousandths of a centimeter of metal foil, and beta (b) radiation, which can pass through 100 times as much foil before it was absorbed. Shortly thereafter, a third form of radiation, named gamma (g) rays, was discovered that can penetrate as much as several centimeters of lead. The three kinds of radiation also differ in the way they are affected by electric and magnetic fields. Rutherford began his graduate work by studying the effect of x-rays on various materials. Shortly after the discovery of radioactivity, he turned to the study of the -particles emitted by uranium metal and its compounds. Before he could study the effect of -particles on matter, Rutherford had to develop a way of counting individual -particles.

Rutherford responded, \"Why not let him see whether any -particles can be scattered through a large angle?\" When this experiment was done, Marsden found that a small fraction (perhaps 1 in 20,000) of the -particles were scattered through angles larger than 90o (see Figure 6.7a). Many years later, reflecting on his reaction to these results, Rutherford said: \"It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life.

Occasionally, an -particle traveled along a path that would eventually lead to a direct collision with the nucleus of one of the 2000 or so atoms it had to pass through. When this happened, repulsion between the nucleus and the -particle deflected the -particle through an angle of 90o or more. By carefully measuring the fraction of the -particles deflected through large angles, Rutherford was able to estimate the size of the nucleus. According to his calculations, the radius of the nucleus is at least 10,000 times smaller than the radius of the atom. The vast majority of the volume of an atom is therefore empty space.\nNaming the Proton (Ernest Rutherford)\nShortly after the World War I, in 1920, Rutherford proposed the name proton for the positively charged particles in the nucleus of an atom.\nProposing the Neutron (Ernest Rutherfor)\nAt the same time that Rutherford proposed the name proton for the positively charged particle in the nucleus of an atom, he proposed that the nucleus also contained a neutral particle, eventually named the neutron. It was not until 1932, however, that James Chadwickwas able to prove that these neutral particles exist.\nJ.J. Thomson: He discovered the electron in a series of experiments designed to study the nature of electric discharge in a high-vacuum cathode-ray tube, an area being investigated by numerous scientists at the time. Thomson interpreted the deflection of the rays by electrically charged plates and magnets as evidence of \"bodies much smaller than atoms\" that he calculated as having a very large value for the charge-to-mass ratio. Later he estimated the value of the charge itself. In 1904 Thomson suggested a model of the atom as a sphere of positive matter in which electrons are positioned by electrostatic forces. His efforts to estimate the number of electrons in an atom from measurements of the scattering of light, X, beta, and gamma rays initiated the research trajectory along which his student Ernest Rutherford moved. Thomson's last important experimental program focused on determining the nature of positively charged particles. Here his techniques led to the development of the mass spectrograph. His assistant, Francis Aston, developed Thomson's instrument further and with the improved version was able to discover isotopes—atoms of the same element with different atomic weights—in a large number of nonradioactive elements.\nHenry Mosley: British physicist who first established the atomic numbers of the elements by studying their X-ray spectra. This led to a complete classification of the elements, and also provided an experimental basis for an understanding of the structure of the atom. he made discoveries which were of fundamental importance to the development of both physics and chemistry. When he joined Rutherford's group in 1910, Rutherford was researching the phenomena associated with natural radioactivity. Moseley at first helped Rutherford in this work, but when reports of the diffraction of X-rays by Max von Laue (1879-1960) reached him in 1912, Moseley persuaded Rutherford to allow him to study X-ray spectra. He received instruction in X-ray diffraction from Lawrence Bragg (1890-1971) and in 1913 Moseley introduced X-ray spectroscopy to determine the X-ray spectra of the elements. In a series of brilliant investigations, Moseley allowed the X-rays produced from various substances used as a target in an X-ray tube to be diffracted by a crystal of potassium ferrocyanide. The glancing angles were measured accurately and the position of the diffracted beams determined to obtain the wavelengths and frequencies of the X-rays emitted. Moseley examined metals from aluminum to gold and he found that their X-ray spectra were similar but with a deviation that changed regularly through the series. He found that a graph of the square root of the frequency of each radiation against the number representing the element's position in the periodic table gave a straight line. He called this number the atomic number of the element, which has since been shown to be the positive charge on the nucleus and thus the number of protons in the nucleus. Since the atom is electrically neutral, the atomic number is also the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus. It was as a direct result of this work that atomic numbers were placed on a sound experimental foundation. Moseley found that when the elements are arranged in the periodic table according to their atomic numbers, all irregularity caused in the older system of grouping elements by their atomic weight disappeared. Now that the elements were numbered, the rare earth elements could be sorted out, a process that Moseley began at Oxford towards the end of his life. The numbering system also enabled Moseley to predict that several more elements would be discovered, namely those with atomic numbers of 43, 61, 72, 75, 87 and 91. These were all found in due course. Although the number of elements which Moseley was able to examine was limited, the equation relating the square root of the frequency to the atomic number has been found to hold in all cases. The equation is known as Moseley's Law. It has enabled scientists to identify a total of 105 elements in a continuous series of atomic numbers. Any further elements that might be produced by nuclear reactions can only have greater atomic numbers. In 1913 and 1914, the young physicist published his findings in two remarkable papers in the Philosophical Magazine and entitled them The High-Frequency Spectra of the Elements. Moseley's discovery told how many electrons were present in any element, and tied in nicely with the quantum theory of the hydrogen atom which was published in 1913 by Niels Bohr (1885-1962). Moseley's fundamental discovery was a milestone in our knowledge of the constitution of the atom, and we are left to ponder on what this great brain might have discovered had he not been so tragically killed at so young an age.\nJames Chadwick: James Chadwick proved the existence of neutrons, the elementary particle without any electrical charge and a fundamental building block of the atom's nucleus. One of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century, it effectively solved the jigsaw puzzle of the atom, and earned Chadwick the 1935 Nobel Prize for Physics. Following Chadwick's breakthrough, he and other scientists began experimenting on all types of materials with neutrons, leading to the discovery of nuclear fission when uranium is bombarded with neutrons, and the eventual development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power production. Chadwick proofs the existence of the neutron in 1932 what accelerated the research in nuclear physics immensely. Chadwick's own research focused on radioactivity. In 1919 Rutherford developed a theory on the atom's nucleus and theorized on the existence of a neuron, a non charged particle within the atom's nucleus. But they and other researchers were finding that the neutron did not seem to be the only particle in the nucleus. As they studied atomic disintegration, they kept seeing that the atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus, equivalent to the positive charge of the atom) was less than the atomic mass (average mass of the atom). For example, a helium atom has an atomic mass of 4, but an atomic number (or positive charge) of 2. Since electrons have almost no mass, it seemed that something besides the protons in the nucleus were adding to the mass. One leading explanation was that there were electrons and additional protons in the nucleus as well -- the protons still contributed their mass but their positive charge was canceled out by the negatively charged electrons. So in the helium example, there would be four protons and two electrons in the nucleus to yield a mass of 4 but a charge of only 2. Rutherford also put out the idea that there could be a particle with mass but no charge. He called it a neutron, and imagined it as a paired proton and electron. There was no evidence for any of these ideas. Chadwick kept the problem in the back of his mind while working on other things. Experiments in Europe caught his eye, especially those of Frederic and Irene Joliot-Curie. They used a different method for tracking particle radiation. Chadwick repeated their experiments but with the goal of looking for a neutral particle -- one with the same mass as a proton, but with zero charge. His experiments were successful. He was able to determine that the neutron did exist and that its mass was about 0.1 percent more than the proton's. He published his findings with characteristic modesty in a first paper entitled \"Possible Existence of Neutron.\" In 1935 he received the Nobel Prize for his discovery. His findings were quickly accepted and Werner Heisenberg then showed that the neutron could not be a proton-electron pairing, but had to be its own unique particle -- the third piece of the atom to be found. This new idea dramatically changed the picture of the atom and accelerated discoveries in atomic physics. Physicists soon found that the neutron made an ideal \"bullet\" for bombarding other nuclei. Unlike charged particles, it was not repelled by similarly-charged particles and could smash right into the nucleus. Before long, neutron bombardment was applied to the uranium atom, splitting its nucleus and releasing the huge amounts of energy predicted by Einstein's equation E = mc2.\nPosted by\nKayly Adams\nQuestion 1B?\nErnest Rutherford: Known as the father of nuclear physics. he discovered the concept of radioactive half life, proved that radioactivity involved the transmutation of one chemical element to another, and also differentiated and named alpha and beta radiation. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 \"for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances\". he postulated that atoms have their positive charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model, or planetary, model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering in his gold foil experiment. He is widely credited with first splitting the atom in 1917, and leading the first experiment to \"split the nucleus\" in a controlled manner by two students under his direction, one being John Cockcroft..\nJohn Cockcroft: A British physicist, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for splitting the atomic nucleus with Ernest Walton, and was instrumental in the development of nuclear power. In 1928, he began to work on the acceleration of protons with Ernest Walton. In 1932, they bombarded lithium with high energy protons and succeeded in transmuting it into helium and other chemical elements. This was one of the earliest experiments to change the atomic nucleus of one element to a different nucleus by artificial means. In 1951, Cockcroft, along with Walton, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in the use of accelerated particles to study the atomic nucleus.\nErnest Walton: He was an Irish physicist and Nobel laureate for his work with John Cockcroft with atom-smashing experiments done at Cambridge University in the early 1930s. Walton is the only Irishman to have won a Nobel Prize in science.Walton and John Cockcroft collaborated to build an apparatus that split the nuclei of lithium atoms by bombarding them with a stream of protons accelerated inside a high-voltage tube (700 kilovolts). The splitting of the lithium nuclei produced helium nuclei. This was experimental verification of theories about atomic structure that had been proposed earlier by Rutherford, George Gamow, and others.\nErwin Schrodinger: He was an Austrian theoretical physicist who was one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, and is famous for a number of important contributions to physics. Especially his experiment, Schrodinger equation, for which he received the Noble Prize in Physics for in 1933. In 1935, after much correspondence with his friend ALBERT EINSTEIN, he proposed the Schrodinger's Cat Thought Experiment.\nPosted by\nEmail This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest\nExamine the history of the development of the atom. We have already discussed the major players in the development of the atom. Pick out at least 8 major players who helped aid in the development of the concept of the atom. Then explain each experiment in a concise explanation. Then explain how each one aided in the development of the next or how their concept assisted in the further development of the current quantum model of the atom.\nDemocritus- The material cause of all things that exist is the coming together of atoms and void. Atoms are too small to be perceived by the senses. They are eternal and have many different shapes, and they can cluster together to create things that are perceivable. Differences in shape, arrangement, and position of atoms produce different things. By aggregation they provide bulky objects that we can perceive with our sight and other senses. We see changes in things because of the rearrangement of atoms, but atoms themselves are eternal. Words such as ‘nothing’, ‘the void’, and ‘the infinite’ describe space. Individual atoms are describable as ‘not nothing’, ‘being’, and ‘the compact’. There is no void in atoms, so they cannot be divided. I hold the same view as Leucippus regarding atoms and space: atoms are always in motion in space.\nJohn Dalton- He proposed the Atomic Theory in 1803 which stated that (1) all matter was composed of small indivisible particles termed atoms, (2) atoms of a given element possess unique characteristics and weight, and (3) three types of atoms exist: simple (elements), compound (simple molecules), and complex (complex molecules). Dalton's theory was presented in New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808-1827). This work identified chemical elements as a specific type of atom, therefore rejecting Newton's theory of chemical affinities. Instead, Dalton inferred proportions of elements in compounds by taking ratios of the weights of reactants, setting the atomic weight of hydrogen to be identically one. Following Richter, he proposed that chemical elements combine in integral ratios. Despite the importance of the work as the first view of atoms as physically real entities and introduction of a system of chemical symbols, New System of Chemical Philosophy devoted almost as much space to the caloric theory as to atomism.\nDmitiri Mendeleev- He is best known for his work on the periodic table; arranging the 63 known elements into a Periodic Table based on atomic mass, which he published in Principles of Chemistry in 1869. His first Periodic Table was compiled on the basis of arranging the elements in ascending order of atomic weight and grouping them by similarity of properties.  He predicted the existence and properties of new elements and pointed out accepted atomic weights that were in error. This organization surpassed attempts at classification by Beguyer de Chancourtois and Newlands and was published a year before the work of Lothar Meyer. Mendeleev provided for variance from strict atomic weight order, left space for new elements, and predicted three yet-to-be-discovered elements including eke-silicon and eke-boron. His table did not include any of the Noble Gases, however, which had not yet been discovered. The original table has been modified and corrected several times, notably by Mosley, but it had accommodated the discovery of isotopes, rare gases, etc. Mendeleev anticipated Andrews' concept (1869) of the critical temperature of gases. He also investigated the thermal expansion of liquids, and studied the nature and origin of petroleum. He was considered one of the greatest teachers of his time. In 1890 he resigned his professorship and in 1893 became director of the bureau of weights and measures in St. Petersburg, where he remained until his death in 1907.\nJ.J. Thompson- At the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, Thomson was experimenting with currents of electricity inside empty glass tubes. He was investigating a long-standing puzzle known as \" cathode rays\". His experiments prompted him to make a bold proposal: these mysterious rays are streams of particles much smaller than atoms, they are in fact minuscule pieces of atoms. He called these particles \"corpuscles,\" and suggested that they might make up all of the matter in atoms. It was startling to imagine a particle residing inside the atom--most people thought that the atom was indivisible, the most fundamental unit of matter. Thomson's speculation was not unambiguously supported by his experiments. It took more experimental work by Thomson and others to sort out the confusion. The atom is now known to contain other particles as well. Yet Thomson's bold suggestion that cathode rays were material constituents of atoms turned out to be correct. The rays are made up of electrons: very small, negatively charged particles that are indeed fundamental parts of every atom. Modern ideas and technologies based on the electron, leading to television and the computer and much else, evolved through many difficult steps.\nEarnest Rutherford- Rutherford, Ernest (1871-1937): Born in New Zealand, Rutherford studied under J. J. Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory in England. His work constituted a notable landmark in the history of atomic research as he developed Bacquerel's discovery of Radioactivity into an exact and documented proof that the atoms of the heavier elements, which had been thought to be immutable, actually disintegrate (decay) into various forms of radiation.Rutherford was the first to establish the theory of the nuclear atom and to carry out a transmutation reaction (1919) (formation of hydrogen and and oxygen isotope by bombardment of nitrogen with alpha particles). Uranium emanations were shown to consist of three types of rays, alpha (helium nuclei) of low penetrating power, beta (electrons), and gamma, of exceedingly short wavelength and great energy.Ernest Rutherford also discovered the half-life of radioactive elements and applied this to studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206. He also used alpha particles as atomic bullets, probed the atoms in a piece of thin (0.00006 cm) gold foil. He established that the nucleus was: very dense,very small and positively charged. He also assumed that the electrons were located outside the nucleus.\nH.G.J. Moseley-  Henry Moseley's research career lasted only forty months before tragically ending with his death on a Gallipoli battlefield in World War I. But in his classic study of the x-ray spectra of elements, he established the truly scientific basis of the Periodic Table by arranging chemical elements in the order of their atomic numbers. During this time period the first coherent theory of the structure of the atom was just then being developed by Rutherford and his research group, which, besides Moseley, included Niels Bohr, Hans Geiger, Kasimir Fajans, and others. The nature of x rays was also receiving new interest because of the discovery by the German physicist Max von Laue in 1912 that they were diffracted by their passage through crystals and therefore possessed a wave nature. Succeeding experiments by William L. Bragg the same year showed that similar results could be obtained by the reflection of x rays from the face of a crystal. Moseley persuaded Rutherford to allow him and a colleague, C. S. Darwin, to further study the nature of x rays. Their work demonstrated that the spectral line of platinum, which they were using as the anticathode in their x-ray tube, was characteristic of that element alone. Moseley returned to Oxford, and despite the experimental deficiencies of his laboratories, measured the x-ray spectral lines of nearly all the elements from aluminum to gold. The results of his study showed a clear and simple progression of the elements that was based on the number of protons in the atomic nucleus, rather than the order based on atomic weights that was then the basis of the Periodic Table.\nNiels Bohr- Bohr began to work on the problem of the atom's structure. Ernest Rutherford had recently suggested the atom had a miniature, dense nucleus surrounded by a cloud of nearly weightless electrons. There were a few problems with the model, however. For example, according to classical physics, the electrons orbiting the nucleus should lose energy until they spiral down into the center, collapsing the atom. Bohr proposed adding to the model the new idea of quanta put forth by Max Planck in 1901. That way, electrons existed at set levels of energy, that is, at fixed distances from the nucleus. If the atom absorbed energy, the electron jumped to a level further from the nucleus; if it radiated energy, it fell to a level closer to the nucleus. His model was a huge leap forward in making theory fit the experimental evidence that other physicists had found over the years. A few inaccuracies remained to be ironed out by others over the next few years, but his essential idea was proved correct. He received the Nobel Prize for this work in 1922, and it's what he's most famous for. But he was only 37 at the time, and he didn't stop there. Among other things, he put forth the theory of the nucleus as a liquid drop, and the idea of \"complementarity\" -- that things may have a dual nature (as the electron is both particle and wave) but we can only experience one aspect at a time. After Hitler took power in Germany, Bohr was deeply concerned for his colleagues there, and offered a place for many escaping Jewish scientists to live and work. He later donated his gold Nobel medal to the Finnish war effort. In 1939 Bohr visited the United States with the news from Lise Meitner (who had escaped German-occupied Austria) that German scientists were working on splitting the atom. This spurred the United States to launch the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. Shortly after Bohr's return home, the German army occupied Denmark. Three years later Bohr's family fled to Sweden in a fishing boat. Then Bohr and his son Aage left Sweden traveling in the empty bomb rack of a British military plane. They ultimately went to the United States, where both joined the government's team of physicists working on atomic bomb at Los Alamos. Bohr had qualms about the consequences of the bomb. He angered Winston Churchill by wanting to share information with the Soviet Union and supporting postwar arms control. Bohr went on to organize the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1955.\nSchrodinger- In 1920 he took up an academic position as assistant to Msx Wein, followed by positions at Stuttgart (extraordinary professor), Breslau (ordinary professor), and at the University of Zurich (replacing von Laue) where he settled for six years. In later years Schrödinger looked back to his Zurich period with great pleasure - it was here that he enjoyed so much the contact and friendship of many of his colleagues, among whom were Hermann Weyl and Peter Debye. It was also his most fruitful period, being actively engaged in a variety of subjects of theoretical physics. His papers at that time dealt with specific heats of solids, with problems of thermodynamics (he was greatly interested in Boltzmann's probability theory) and of atomic spectra; in addition, he indulged in physiological studies of colour (as a result of his contacts with Kohlrausch and Exner, and of Helmholtz's lectures). His great discovery, Schrödinger's wave equation, was made at the end of this epoch-during the first half of 1926.It came as a result of his dissatisfaction with the quantum condition in Bohr's orbit theory and his belief that atomic spectra should really be determined by some kind of eigenvalue problem. Shrodinger viewed electrons as continuous clouds and introduced \"wave mechanics\" as a mathematical model of the atom.For this work he shared with Dirac the Nobel Prize for 1933.\nPosted by\nQuestion 1B\nNiels Bohr- A model of the atom, first described by Niels Bohr, that explains the emission and absorption of radiation as transitions between stationary electronic states in which the electron orbits the nucleus at a definite distance. The Bohr model violates the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, since it postulates definite paths and momenta for electrons as they move around the nucleus. Modern theories usually use atomic orbitals to describe the behavior of electrons in atoms.\nErnest Rutherford- Ernest Rutherford explains his atomic theory describing the atom as having a central positive nucleus surrounded by negative orbiting electrons. This model suggested that most of the mass of the atom was contained in the small nucleus, and that the rest of the atom was mostly empty space. Rutherford came to this conclusion following the results of his famous gold foil experiment. This experiment involved the firing of radioactive particles through minutely thin metal foils (mostly gold) and detecting them using screens coated with zinc sulfide (a scintillator). Rutherford found that although the vast majority of particles passed straight through the foil approximately 1 in 8000 were deflected leading him to his theory that most of the atom was made up of 'empty space'. His model didn't make any headway in the explanation of the electrons but just kinda helped in the understanding of the past and present atomic structures.\nWilliam Crookes- This fascinating scientist discovered the phenomenon upon which depends the action of the well-known little instrument, the Crookes radiometer, in which a system of vanes, each blackened on one side and polished on the other, is set in rotation when exposed to radiant energy. He did not, however, provide the true explanation of this apparent attraction and repulsion resulting from radiation. Of more fundamental importance were his researches on the passage of the electrical discharge through rarefied gases. He found that as the attenuation of the gas was made greater the dark space round the negative electrode extended, while rays, now known as cathode rays, proceed from the electrode. He investigated the properties of the rays, showing that they travel in straight lines, cause phosphorescence in objects upon which they impinge, and by their impact produce great heat. He believed that he had discovered a fourth state of matter, which he called \"radiant matter\". But his theoretical views on the nature of \"radiant matter\" proved to be mistaken. He believed the rays to consist of streams of particles of ordinary molecular magnitude. It remained for J. J. Thomson to discover their subatomic nature, and to prove that cathode rays consist of streams of negative electrons, that is, of negatively electrified particles whose mass is only 1/1,800 that of the atom of hydrogen.\nJ.J. Thompson-Thomson's work suggested that the atom was not an \"indivisible\" particle as John Dalton had suggested but, a jigsaw puzzle made of smaller pieces.\nThomson's notion of the electron came from his work with a nineteenth century scientific curiosity: the cathode ray tube. For years scientists had known that if an electric current was passed through a vacuum tube, a stream of glowing material could be seen; however, no one could explain why. Thomson found that the mysterious glowing stream would bend toward a positively charged electric plate. Thomson theorized, and was later proven correct, that the stream was in fact made up of small particles, pieces of atoms that carried a negative charge. These particles were later named electrons. The present day atom has electrons in it so that has not changed. His discovery played a huge part in the constructing of the present day model.\nJohn Dalton-a study of Dalton's own laboratory notebooks, discovered in the rooms of the Lit & Phil, concluded that so far from Dalton being led by his search for an explanation of the law of multiple proportions to the idea that chemical combination consists in the interaction of atoms of definite and characteristic weight, the idea of atoms arose in his mind as a purely physical concept, forced upon him by study of the physical properties of the atmosphere and other gases. Dalton proceeded to print his first published table of relative atomic weights. Six elements appear in this table, namely hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, and phosphorus, with the atom of hydrogen conventionally assumed to weigh 1. Dalton provided no indication in this first paper how he had arrived at these numbers. However, in his laboratory notebook under the date 6 September 1803 there appears a list in which he sets out the relative weights of the atoms of a number of elements, derived from analysis of water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, etc. by chemists of the time. His discoveries led to the discovery of a few elements his atomic theory has also played a major role in the new discoveries.\nH.G.J Mosley-Before Moseley and his created law, atomic numbers had been thought of as a semi-arbitrary ordering number, vaguely increasing with atomic weight but not strictly defined by it. Moseley redefined the idea of atomic numbers from its previous status as an ad hoc numerical tag to help sorting the elements, in particular in the Periodic Table, into a real and objective whole-number quantity that was experimentally measurable. Furthermore, as noted by Bohr, Moseley's law provided a reasonably complete experimental set of data that supported the conception by Ernest Rutherford and Antonius Van den Broek of the atom, with a positively-charged nucleus surrounded by negatively-charged electrons in which the atomic number is understood to be the exactly physical number of positive charges in the central atomic nuclei of the elements. Simple modification of Rydberg's and Bohr's formulas were found to give theoretical justification for Moseley's empirically-derived law for determining atomic numbers. The atomic number is one of the most important things of an atom. It has helped us understand so much about current atoms. His dicovery was a very important and useful discovery.\nDmitri Mendeleev- Developed the first periodic table when trying to classify elements not by accidental or instinctive reasons, but by a set principle. He believed it should be numerical in nature to eliminate any margin of arbitrariness. The trend of increasing atomic mass allowed him to discover a periodicity of elemental properties. The first model used vertical columns and showed that there were some missing places where there could be undiscovered elements.\nJames Chadwick- discovered a third type of subatomic particle, which he named the neutron. Neutrons help stabilize the protons in the atom's nucleus. Because the nucleus is so tightly packed together, the positively charged protons would tend to repel each other normally. Neutrons help to reduce the repulsion between protons and stabilize the atom's nucleus. Neutrons always reside in the nucleus of atoms and they are about the same size as protons. However, neutrons do not have any electrical charge; they are electrically neutral.\nAtoms are electrically neutral because the number of protons + charges is equal to the number of electrons - charges and thus the two cancel out. As the atom gets larger, the number of protons increases, and so does the number of electrons in the neutral state of the atom. The illustration linked below compares the two simplest atoms, hydrogen and helium. The present day model still consists of the protons. His discovery is still a very important factor today and for the present day atom.\nPosted by\nExamine the history of the development of the atom.

Of the mass of atoms, Democritus said \"The more any indivisible exceeds, the heavier it is.\" But their exact position on weight of atoms is disputed.\nIssac Newton: Newton laid the foundation for differential and integral calculus. His work on optics and gravitation make him one of the greatest scientists the world has known. Newton's greatest achievement was his work in physics and celestial mechanics, which culminated in the theory of universal gravitation. By 1666 Newton had early versions of his three laws of motion. He had also discovered the law giving the centrifugal force on a body moving uniformly in a circular path. However he did not have a correct understanding of the mechanics of circular motion.\njohn dalton:John Dalton developed the first useful atomic theory of matter around 1803. In the course of his studies on meteorology, Dalton concluded that evaporated water exists in air as an independent gas. He wondered how water and air could occupy the same space at the same time, when obviously solid bodies can't. If the water and air were composed of discrete particles, Dalton reasoned, evaporation might be viewed as a mixing of water particles with air particles. He performed a series of experiments on mixtures of gases to determine what effect properties of the individual gases had on the properties of the mixture as a whole. While trying to explain the results of those experiments, Dalton developed the hypothesis that the sizes of the particles making up different gases must be different.\nJ.J. Thomson: J J Thomson experimented on cathode rays. In Britain, physicists had argued these rays were particles, but German physicists disagreed, thinking they were a type of electromagnetic radiation. Thomson showed that cathode rays were particles with a negative electric charge and much smaller than an atom. He also thought all atoms contained them. These particles were later named electrons.\nmicheal faraday:Faraday's introduction of the concept of lines of force was rejected by most of the mathematical physicists of Europe, since they assumed that electric charges attract and repel one another, by action at a distance, making such lines unnecessary. Faraday had demonstrated the phenomenon of electromagnetism in a series of experiments, however. This experimental necessity probably led the physicist James Clerk Maxwell to accept the concept of lines of force and put Faraday's ideas into mathematical form, thus giving birth to modern field theory.\nDmitri Mendeleev: Arranged elements into 7 groups with similar properties. He discovered that the properties of elements \"were periodic functions of the their atomic weights\". This became known as the Periodic Law.\nalbert einstein:Einstein's contributions to physics began in 1905 with three major results: the explanation of Brownian motion in terms of molecules; the explanation of the photoelectric effect in terms of the quantum; and the special theory of relativity that links time to space and energy to matter. From 1907 to 1915 Einstein developed general relativity, a theory of gravity more accurate than Newton's; it became the basis of theoretical cosmology. In failed efforts in the 1930s to refute the interpretation of quantum theory in terms of probability, Einstein contributed to the theoretical basis for what is sometimes called teleportation of photons (which Einstein called \"spooky action at a distance\"). His last major effort was an attempt to unify electromagnetism and gravity into a single unified field theory, still an active problem of physics.\nniels bohr:Niels Bohr was a Danish physicist who made fundamental contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum mechanics, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. He was also part of the team of physicists working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr married Margrethe Nørlund in 1912, and one of their sons, Aage Niels Bohr, grew up to be an important physicist, who like his father received the Nobel prize, in 1975. Bohr is widely considered to be the one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century.\nPosted by\nquestion 1B\nExamine the history of the development of the atom.

Of the mass of atoms, Democritus said \"The more any indivisible exceeds, the heavier it is.\" But their exact position on weight of atoms is disputed. These were the things that composed all matter and the only differences were the size, shape, and weight. There was much speculation and without a clear way to prove the idea, they largely ignored his ramblings because they didn't have the technology to further study it. They didn’t look at this again for about 2000 years.\nJohn Dalton: Credited with developing the atomic theory. His theory is as follows. 1. Matter is composed of small particles called atoms. 2. All atoms of an element are identical, but are different from those of any other element. 3. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 4. Atoms always combine in whole number multiples of each other. Dalton proceeded to print his first published table of relative atomic weights. Six elements appear in this table, namely hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, and phosphorus, with the atom of hydrogen conventionally assumed to weigh 1. Dalton provided no indication in this first paper how he had arrived at these numbers. However, in his laboratory notebook under the date 6 September 1803[4] there appears a list in which he sets out the relative weights of the atoms of a number of elements, derived from analysis of water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, etc. by chemists of the time.\nDmitri Mendeleev: Developed the first periodic table when trying to classify elements not by accidental or instinctive reasons, but by a set principle. He believed it should be numerical in nature to eliminate any margin of arbitrariness. The trend of increasing atomic mass allowed him to discover a periodicity of elemental properties. The first model used vertical columns and showed that there were some missing places where there could be undiscovered elements. On 6 March 1869, Mendeleev made a formal presentation to the Russian Chemical Society, entitled The Dependence between the Properties of the Atomic Weights of the Elements, which described elements according to both atomic weight and valence. This presentation stated that 1.The elements, if arranged according to their atomic weight, exhibit an apparent periodicity of properties. 2.Elements which are similar in regards to their chemical properties have atomic weights which are either of nearly the same value (e.g., Pt, Ir, Os) or which increase regularly (e.g., K, Rb, Cs). 3. The arrangement of the elements in groups of elements in the order of their atomic weights corresponds to their so-called valencies, as well as, to some extent, to their distinctive chemical properties; as is apparent among other series in that of Li, Be, B, C, N, O, and F. 4.The elements which are the most widely diffused have small atomic weights. 5. The magnitude of the atomic weight determines the character of the element, just as the magnitude of the molecule determines the character of a compound body. 6. We must expect the discovery of many yet unknown elements–for example, two elements, analogous to aluminum and silicon, whose atomic weights would be between 65 and 75. 7. The atomic weight of an element may sometimes be amended by knowledge of those of its contiguous elements. Thus the atomic weight of tellurium must lie between 123 and 126, and cannot be 128. Here Mendeleev seems to be wrong as the \"atomic mass\" of tellurium (127.6) remains higher than that of iodine (126.9) as displayed on modern periodic tables, but this is due to the way atomic masses are calculated, based on a weighted average of all of an element's common isotopes, not just the one-to-one proton/neutron-ratio version of the element to which Mendeleev was referring. 8. Certain characteristic properties of elements can be foretold from their atomic weights\nPierre and Marie Curie: These two worked in the discovery of radioactivity by following the notes of Henri Becquerel. In 1896 Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy, but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Becquerel had, in fact, discovered radioactivity. Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis. She used a clever technique to investigate samples. Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had invented the electrometer, a sensitive device for measuring electrical charge. Using the Curie electrometer, she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity. Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present. She had shown that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules, but must come from the atom itself. In scientific terms, this was the most important single piece of work that she conducted.\nErnest Rutherford: Determined that radiation was emitted from two different components of uranium. He unsuccessfully attempted to separate the two by using prisms of glass, aluminum, and paraffin wax. Using two positively charged plates, he identified the components as positive particles and lighter mass negative particles. During the investigation of radioactivity he coined the terms alpha and beta in 1899 to describe the two distinct types of radiation emitted by thorium and uranium. These rays were differentiated on the basis of penetrating power. From 1900 to 1903 he was joined at McGill by the young Frederick Soddy and they collaborated on research into the transmutation of elements. Rutherford had demonstrated that radioactivity was the spontaneous disintegration of atoms. He noticed that a sample of radioactive material invariably took the same amount of time for half the sample to decay—its \"half-life\"—and created a practical application using this constant rate of decay as a clock, which could then be used to help determine the age of the Earth, which turned out to be much older than most of the scientists at the time believed. In 1903, Rutherford realized that a type of radiation from radium discovered (but not named) by French chemist Paul Villard in 1900 must represent something different from alpha rays and beta rays, due to its very much greater penetrating power. Rutherford gave this third type of radiation its name also: the gamma ray.\nJ.J. Thomson: Until 1897, scientists believed atoms were indivisible; the ultimate particles of matter, but Thomson proved them wrong when he discovered that atoms contained particles known as electrons. Thomson discovered this through his explorations on the properties of cathode rays. Thomson found that the rays could be deflected by an electric field (in addition to magnetic fields, which was already known). By comparing the deflection of a beam of cathode rays by electric and magnetic fields he was able to measure the particle's mass. This showed that cathode rays were matter, but he found that the particles were about 2000 times lighter than the mass of the lightest atom, hydrogen. He concluded that the rays were composed of very light negatively charged particles which he called \"corpuscles\". Thomson believed that the corpuscles emerged from the atoms of the trace gas inside his cathode ray tubes. He thus concluded that atoms were divisible, and that the corpuscles were their building blocks. To explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge; this was the plum pudding model as the electrons were embedded in the positive charge like plums in a plum pudding (although in Thomson's model they were not stationary).\nHenry Mosley: Before Moseley's discovery, the atomic numbers (or elemental number) of an element had been thought of as a semi-arbitrary sequential number, based on the sequence of atomic masses, but modified somewhat where chemists found this to be desirable, such as by the great Russian chemist, Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev. In his invention of the Periodic Table of the Elements, Mendeleev had interchanged the orders of a few pairs of elements in order to put them in more appropriate places in this table of the elements. For example, the metals cobalt and nickel had been assigned the atomic numbers 27 and 28, respectively, based on their known chemical and physical properties, even though they have nearly the same atomic masses. In fact, the atomic mass of cobalt is slightly larger than that of nickel, which would have placed them in backwards order if they had been placed in the Periodic Table blindly according to atomic mass. Moseley's experiments in X-ray crystallography showed directly from their physics that cobalt and nickel have the different atomic numbers, 27 and 28, and that they are placed in the Periodic Table correctly by Moseley's objective measurements of their atomic numbers. Hence, Moseley's discovery demonstrated that the atomic numbers of elements are not just rather arbitrary numbers based on chemistry and the intuition of chemists, but rather, they have a firm experimental basis from the physics of their X-ray spectra.\nJames Chadwick: He solved the problem of the extra nuclear mass when he identified the neutron. This occurred while studying the radiation resulting from bombarding of beryllium with alpha particles. He noted a particle with approximately the same mass as a proton being released. He determined that, since the particle was not bent by electrical fields and was highly penetrating, it was electrically neutral. In 1932, Chadwick discovered a previously unknown particle in the atomic nucleus. This particle became known as the neutron because of its lack of electric charge. Chadwick's discovery was crucial for the fission of uranium 235. Unlike positively charged alpha particles, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms, neutrons do not need to overcome any Coulomb barrier and can therefore penetrate and split the nuclei of even the heaviest elements. For this discovery he was awarded the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society in 1932 and the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1935. Chadwick’s discovery made it possible to create elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory. His discovery particularly inspired Enrico Fermi, Italian physicist and Nobel laureate, to discover nuclear reactions brought by slowed neutrons, and led Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, German radio chemists in Berlin, to the revolutionary discovery of “nuclear fission”.\nPosted by",

Thomson\n3 3 Structure History Plum-Pudding Model Thomson developed his “plum-pudding” model - Model is named after a traditional English dessert - The atom consisted of a positively charged electric field throughout which electrons were suspended - The atom consisted of mostly empty space with its mass being due to the electrons\n4 4 Structure History Born Died 1950 Hantaro Nagaoka Proposed a “Saturnian Model” of the atom Japanese physicist - A flat ring of electrons that revolve around a positively charged particle\n5 5 Structure History Born Died Gold Foil Experiment Awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 for investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances - Shot alpha particles at a thin piece of gold foil - He expected the alpha particles to pass straight through the foil because of their large mass Ernest Rutherford - Experiments were performed by his students, Hans Geiger and Earnest Marsden New Zealand chemist\n6 6 Structure History Contrary to Rutherford’s prediction, the results showed that some of the particles were deflected to the side of the foil while a small few bounced off the foil. - He said that the alpha particles bouncing off the gold foil was the equivalent of a cannon ball bouncing off a piece of tissue paper. - The particles that bounced off must have been hitting objects with a very small volume but a very large mass. alpha particle beam gold foil screen alpha particle emitter\n7 7 Structure History Planetary Model The atom contains a tiny dense center called the nucleus. The nucleus is essentially the entire mass of the atom. The nucleus is positively charged. This positive charge balances out the negative charge of the electrons making the atom neutral. Electrons move around in the empty space surrounding the nucleus much like the way the planets orbit the sun. Based on the results of this experiment, Rutherford proposed his Planetary Model of the atom:\n8 8 Structure History Planetary Model Electrons are held in their orbits by the electric force that attracts negatively charged electrons to the positively charged nucleus One problem - This model of the atom is not stable when applied to the rules of classical physics - Classical electromagnetic theory says that any charged particle that is not at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line will emit energy as electromagnetic radiation - As they lose energy they will spiral towards the nucleus and collide with it - Therefore the electrons in the planetary model will be emitting electromagnetic radiation\n9 9 Structure History Bohr developed a model of the hydrogen atom that would explain its line spectrum. Born Died 1962 Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922 for the investigation of the structure of atoms and the radiation emanating from them.

Balmer developed a formula into which the wavelengths of the four visible lines of the hydrogen spectrum would fit. Balmer’s formula was modified five years later by J.R. Rydberg and is now known as the Balmer-Rydberg equation. Rydberg Constant x nm -1\n11 11 Structure History Bohr borrowed Planck’s idea that energies are quantized and proposed that only orbits of certain radii, corresponding to defined energies, are permitted. - An electron orbiting in an allowed orbit will not radiate energy and therefore will not spiral into the nucleus. Bohr agreed with Rutherford’s idea that the electrons orbit the nucleus. He assumed that the classical laws of physics were inadequate to describe the nature of the atom. The classical ideas state that a negative electron should spiral into the positive nucleus. He came up with a simple formula for the energies of these orbits: Rydberg Constant 2.18 x J\n12 12 Structure History A photon is absorbed when an electron moves to an orbit with a higher energy state and is emitted when an electron moves to an orbit with a lower energy state. The integer n is called the principal quantum number and each orbit corresponds to a different value of n. - As the value of n increases, the radius of the orbit increases. Bohr assumed that electrons could “quantum jump” from one allowed orbit to another by absorbing or emitting photons of light with specific frequencies. Bohr’s model states that only photons of specific frequencies can be absorbed or emitted by the atom. - These frequencies must correspond to the energy difference between two orbits.\n13 13 Structure History Energy of final orbit Energy of initial orbit Planck’s constant 6.63 x J. s Frequency(s -1 ) Substituting the energy formula above into Bohr’s equation gives the relationship between the frequency of the absorbed or emitted light and the principal quantum number of the two states. Previous formula:\n14 14 Structure History n f > n i ; photon is absorbed n f < n i ; photon is emitted Important note! - A calculated negative value only means that light is being emitted during the transition. However, the frequency of that photon of light is still positive. Bohr’s model was important because it introduced the idea of using quantized energy states for electrons in atoms. However, his model is only accurate for atoms or ions with a single electron. H, He +, Li 2+\n15 15 Structure History Protons Rutherford discovered that he could change nitrogen atoms into oxygen atoms by striking them with energetic alpha particles Rutherford and other physicists realized that upon transmuting one atom into another a hydrogen nuclei would be emitted. This process is known as transmutation. By comparing nuclear masses to charge, it was realized that the positive charge of any nucleus could be accounted for by an integer number of hydrogen nuclei. The hydrogen nucleus was said to be an elementary particle and given the name proton by Rutherford. The term proton first appeared in print in 1920.\n16 16 Structure History Rutherford predicted the existence of a neutral particle, with the approximate mass of a proton, that could result from the capture of an electron by a proton German physicists Walter Bothe and Herbert Becker shot alpha particles at beryllium. The beryllium emitted a neutral radiation which they believed to be high energy gamma rays Irene and Frederick Joliet-Curie put a block of paraffin wax in front of these beryllium rays and observed high speed protons coming from the paraffin. They knew gamma rays could eject electrons from metals and assumed the same phenomena was occurring with the protons in the paraffin. Neutrons\n17 17 Structure History Proved that the beryllium emissions contained a neutral component approximately equal to that of the proton. He called this neutral component a neutron Franz Curie proves that the neutron are NOT the result of the binding of an electron to a proton but an elementary particle, like electrons and protons. Born Died 1974 British physicist Knighted in 1945 Student and colleague of Rutherford Chadwick is awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the neutron. James Chadwick\n18 18 Structure History De Broglie proposed that an electron in its orbit around the nucleus has associated with it a particular wavelength. Born Died 1987 Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929 for discovery of the wave nature of electrons. Louis de Broglie French physicist Wave nature of the electron was experimentally proven through electron diffraction by Davisson and Germer. - An electron microscope uses the wave characteristics of electrons in the same manner as an optical microscope (like in school science labs) uses the wave behavior of light. Light microscope magnify up to 1,000X Electron microscope magnify up to 300,000X\n19 19 Structure History Werner Heisenberg Born Died 1976 German physicist Awarded the Nobel Prize in 1932 for the creation of quantum mechanics Uncertainty Principle It is impossible to know both the exact momentum of an electron and its exact location in space at the same time. Therefore, it is wrong to say that the electrons move in defined orbits around the nucleus.\n20 20 Structure History Erwin Schrodinger Born Died 1961 Austrian physicist Wave Equation Wave function Planck’s constant Total energy of the particle Potential energy function of the particle mass Awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for the development of his wave equation. Time Independent Schrodinger Wave Equation\n21 21 Structure History Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle states that if we know the momentum of the electron, we cannot know the exact location of the electron in its orbit. The square of the wave function,, provides information about the electron’s location when it is in an allowed energy state. Therefore, represents the probability that an electron will be in a certain place at a given instant of time. Schrodinger’s wave equation includes both the wavelike and particle-like behavior of the electron.\n22 22 Structure History Subatomic Particles Experiments, which began in the 1930’s, using particle accelerators and other tools have shown the existence of hundreds of different subatomic particles. Scientists were also able to prove that the proton and the neutron are not elementary particles. - They are composed of elementary particles called quarks (up, down, charmed, strange, top and bottom). - A proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark. - A neutron consists of one up quark and two down quarks.\n23 23 Structure History Born Died 1981 Japanese physicist Yukawa predicted the existence of the meson in 1935 Hideki Yukawa The proton and neutron belong to a family of particles called baryons. Baryons, as well as another group of particles called mesons, make up a larger family of particles known as hadrons. The defining characteristic of all hadrons is that the are made up of only quarks.\n24 24 Structure History",

The purpose of  the series is to publish timely, comprehensive books developed from the ACS  sponsored symposia based on current scientific research. Occasionally, books are  developed from symposia sponsored by other organizations when the topic is of  keen interest to the chemistry audience.   Before agreeing to publish a book, the proposed table of contents is reviewed  for appropriate and comprehensive coverage and for interest to the audience. Some  papers may be excluded to better focus the book; others may be added to provide  comprehensiveness. When appropriate, overview or introductory chapters are  added. Drafts of chapters are peer-reviewed prior to final acceptance or rejection,  and manuscripts are prepared in camera-ready format.   As a rule, only original research papers and original review papers are  included in the volumes. Verbatim reproductions of previous published papers  are not accepted.

Giunta*   Department of Chemistry and Physics, Le Moyne College,  Syracuse, NY 13214   *giunta@lemoyne.edu   200 Years of Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Atoms to  Nanotechnology   This volume contains presentations from a symposium titled \"200 Years of  Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Atoms to Nanotechnology,\" held at the 236th  national meeting of ACS in Philadelphia in August 2008. The occasion was the  200th anniversary of the publication of John Dalton's A New System of Chemical  Philosophy (1).   Dalton's theory of the atom is generally considered to be what made the atom  a scientifically fruitful concept in chemistry. To be sure, by Dalton's time the atom  had already had a two-millenium history as a philosophical idea, and corpuscular  thought had long been viable in natural philosophy (that is, in what we would today  call physics).   John Dalton (1766-1844) lived and worked most of his life in Manchester,  and he was a mainstay of that city's Literary and Philosophical Society. He had a  life-long interest in the earth's atmosphere. Indeed, it was this interest that led him  to study gases, out of which study grew his atomic hypothesis (2). His experiments  on gases also led to a result now known as Dalton's law of partial pressures (3).  Dalton's name is also linked to color blindness, sometimes called daltonism, a  condition he described from firsthand experience.   The laws of definite and multiple proportions are also associated with  Dalton, for they can be explained by his atomic hypothesis. The law of definite  proportions or of constant composition had previously been proposed in the work  of Jeremias Richter and Joseph-Louis Proust. The law of multiple proportions  came to be regarded as an empirical law quite independent of its relation to  the atomic hypothesis or perhaps as an empirical law that inspired the atomic  hypothesis; however, Roscoe and Harden have shown that in Dalton's mind it  was a testable prediction which followed from the atomic hypothesis (4).   Dalton's 1808 New System (1) contains a detailed and mature presentation of  his atomic theory. It is not, however, the first published statement of his atomic   Â© 2010 American Chemical Society  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nideas or the first table of his atomic weights. A \"Table of the relative weights  of the ultimate particles of gaseous and other bodies\" appears in reference (2),  published in 1805 after having been read in 1803. Thomas Thomson's account of  Dalton's theory (5) also preceded the publication of Dalton's bookâwith Dalton's  permission.   Thus, 2008 was perhaps an arbitrary year to celebrate 200 years of Dalton's  theory, but as good a year as any. The Symposium Series volume appears in  2010, which is 200 years after the publication of Part II of Dalton's New System.  Readers interested in learning more about Dalton's life and work are directed to  Arnold Thackray 's 1972 volume which remains authoritative even after nearly four  decades (6).   As originally envisioned, the symposium was to examine episodes in the  evolution of the concept of the atom, particularly in chemistry, from Dalton's  day to our own. Clearly, many of Dalton's beliefs about atoms are not shared by  21^-century scientists. For example, the existence of isotopes contradicts Dalton's  statement that \"the ultimate particles of all homogeneous bodies are perfectly  alike in weight, figure, &c.\"(7) Other properties long attributed to atoms, such  as indivisibility and permanence have also been discarded over the course of the  intervening two centuries.   One property that remains in the current concept of atom is discreteness.  If anything, evidence for the particulate nature of matter has continued to  accumulate over that time, notwithstanding the fact that particles can display  wavelike phenomena such as diffraction and regardless of their ultimate nature  (quarks? multidimensional strings? something else?).   Images that resolve discrete atoms and molecules became available in the  1980s, with the invention of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). Its inventors,  Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, submitted their first paper on STM in fall 1981.  Five years later, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. Before long,  other scientists at IBM turned an STM into a device that could pick up and place  individual atoms, in effect turning atoms into individual \"bricks\" in nanofabricated  structures.   STM was the first of a class of techniques known as scanning probe  microscopy. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), invented later in the 1980s, is  currently the most widely used of these techniques. Both STM and AFM depend  on probes with atomically sharp tips; these probes are maneuvred over the surface  of the sample to be imaged, maintaining atom-scale distances between the probe  and sample. Both techniques are capable of picking up atoms individually and  placing them precisely on surfaces (7).   Scanning probe microscopy and manipulation lie at the intersection of  2H-century nano techno logy and 19th-century Daltonian atomism. Never mind  the fact that the devices depend on quantum mechanical forces: the devices  also require atomic-scale engineering to make sharp tips and to steer the probes  closely over sample surfaces. But more importantly, they make visible individual  discrete atoms and are capable of manipulating them. As originally conceived,  the symposium would have had a presentation on applications of atomism to  nanotechnology to bring the coverage up to the presentâor even the future. Alas,  that presentation never materialized, but hints of what it might have covered   2  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nremain in the introduction of this volume to give a sense of the sweep of the topic  and its continued relevance to current science.   Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex  Atoms and Beyond   As already noted, the symposium did not include atoms in nanotechnology.  Neither did it treat the quantum-mechanical atom. So the near end of the historical  span actually included in the symposium extended to the first half of the 20*  century. The far end of that span turned out to be closer to two millenia ago than  two centuries. As a result, the title of the symposium series volume is Atoms in  Chemistry: From Dalton 's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond.   William B. Jensen begins the volume with an overview of scientific atomic  theories from the 17* through 20* centuries. He mentions ancient atomism, but he  begins in earnest analyzing corpuscular theories of matter proposed or entertained  by natural philosophers in the 17* century. He describes the dominant flavors of  atomic notions over four centuries, from the mechanical through the dynamical,  gravimetric, and kinetic, to the electrical. Jensen is Oesper Professor of Chemical  Education and History of Chemistry at the University of Cincinnati and was the  founding editor of the Bulletin for the History of Chemistry.   Leopold May goes back even further in time to outline a variety of atomistic  ideas from around the world. His chapter \"Atomism before Dalton\" concentrates  on conceptions of matter that are more philosophical or religious than scientific,  ranging from ancient Hindu, to classical Greek, to alchemical notions, before  touching on a few concepts from the period of early modern science. May  is Professor of Chemistry, Emeritus, at the Catholic University of America in  Washington, DC.   The next two chapters jump to the middle of the 19* century, a time when  many chemists were using atomic models while avowing a strict agnosticism about  the physical nature or even physical reality of atoms.   David E. Lewis presents a sketch of 19*-century organic structural theories  in a chapter entitled \"150 Years of Organic Structures.\" Fifty years after Dalton,  Friedrich August Kekule and Archibald Scott Couper independently published  representations of organic compounds that rationalized their chemisty and even  facilitated the prediction of new compounds. The investigators did not assign  any physical meaning to their structures, much less assert anything about the  arrangement of atoms in space. Yet the models were inherently atomistic because  they relied on the atomistic picture of bonding put forward by Dalton (that is,  bonding atom to atom). Organic compounds behaved as //the carbon in them  formed chains (i.e., as if they were connected to each other atom to atom) and was  tetravalent. Lewis is Professor of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Eau  Claire.   William H. Brock describes episodes from the second half of the 19* century  in which chemists debated the truth of the atomic-molecular theory. In both cases,  doubts about the physical reality of atoms led chemists to question the soundness  of chemical atomism. The two central figures in this chapter are Benjamin Brodie,   3  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nwho proposed a non-atomic calculus of chemical operations in 1866, and Wilhelm  Ostwald, who proposed to base chemistry on energetics in the 1890s. Brock is  Professor Emeritus of History of Science at the University of Leicester in the  United Kingdom. He is the author of numerous books and papers on the history  of chemistry, including The Norton History of Chemistry.   The next two chapters turn to the physical evidence accumulated in the late  19* and early 20* centuries that suggested that atoms were actually real, even if  they were not exactly as Dalton envisioned them.   The first of these chapters, by Carmen Giunta, concentrates on the evidence  that atoms are compositeânot the ultimate particles of matter. Evidence for the  divisibility and impermanence of atoms was collected even while some chemists  and physicists continued to doubt their very existence. The chapter focuses on  discoveries of the electron, the nucleus, and the heavy particles of the nucleus.  Giunta is Professor of Chemistry at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York,  and he maintains the Classic Chemistry website.   The latter chapter, written by Gary Patterson, focuses on converging lines of  evidence for the physical existence of atoms. By the early decades of the 20*  century, through the efforts of Jean Perrin and others, skepticism over the physical  existence of atoms was practically eliminated. Patterson describes evidence from  X-rays, radioactivity, quantum theory, spectroscopy, and moreâall converging  on the physical existence of atoms and molecules. Gary Patterson is Professor of  Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania.   The final chapter, by Jim and Jenny Marshall, takes the reader beyond  the atom itself to some of the places associated with the history of scientific  atomism. \"Rediscovering Atoms: An Atomic Travelogue\" takes the reader to  several sites in Europe and North America where important work was done on the  development of chemical atomism. The authors include photos of atom-related  sites from their extensive DVD travelogue Rediscovery of the Elements. Jim  Marshall is Professor of Chemistry at the University of North Texas in Denton,  Texas, and Jenny Marshall is an independent contractor of computer services.   To physically visit the sites described by the Marshalls requires a passport. It  is hoped that this volume itself can serve as a passport to important episodes from  the more than 200-year history of atoms in chemistry.   References   1. Dalton, J.

Jensen*   Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, P.O. Box 210172,  Cincinnati, OH 45221   *jensenwb@ucmail.uc.edu   Introductory Apology  It might seem oddly perverse to give a lecture entitled \"400 Years of Atomic   Theory\" at a symposium entitled \"200 Years of Atoms in Chemistry.\" No one  questions, of course, that the 19th- and 20th-centuries were the heyday of chemical  atomism and historians of chemistry have long agreed that Dalton's work was the  starting point for our current quantitative views on this subject. Less well known,  however, is the fact that atomism had been slowly seeping into chemical thought  for nearly two centuries before Dalton and, that while these earlier variants of  chemical atomism did not lead to a significant breakthrough in chemical theory,  they nonetheless gradually produced a significant qualitative reorientation in the  way in which chemists thought about chemical composition and reactivityâa  qualitative reorientation which formed an essential foundation for the rise of a  quantified gravimetric atomism based on Dalton's concept of atomic weight.   My task in this overview lecture is to give you both a feel for this qualitative  pre-Daltonian foundation and to properly interface this prehistory with the later  developments of the 19th and 20th centuries, which will be the focus of the other  talks in this symposium. I hope do this by presenting a very broad overview of  how each century tended to focus on a different atomic parameter and how this  changing focus was reflected in the chemical thought of the period.

Ancient Atomism   Before beginning our four-century survey, however, it is necessary to  first say a little about ancient atomismâand by ancient atomism I mean the  reductionistic mechanical atomism of Leucippus, Democritus and Epicurus rather  than the nonreductionistic pseudo-corpuscularism associated with the \"seeds\"  of Anaxagoras or the \"natural minima\" of Aristotle. Only secondary and often  critical accounts of the atomic doctrines of Leucippus and Democritus have  survived (e.g. in the writings of Aristotle), whereas four Epicurean documents  have survived: three short letters on various topics reproduced by the 3rd-century  AD writer Diogenes Laertius in his Lives of Eminent Philosophers, and a major  Latin prose poem, On the Nature of Things, by the 1st century BC Roman author,  Titus Lucretius Cams.   Epicurean atomism was predicated on five basic assumptions:   a. There is an absolute lower limit to particle divisibilityâi.e., true minimal  particles called \"atoms\" which are not only indivisible but also immutable  and thus permanent.   b. There is an interparticle vacuum or void.  c. All interparticle interaction is due to collision and mechanical   entanglement.  d. The only fundamental atomic properties are size, shape, and motionâall   others are secondary psychological responses to various atomic  complexes.   8  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\ne. There is no dichotomy between mind and matter, thus implying that the  soul is both material and mortal.   Thus we see that Epicurean atomism was both materialistic and strongly  reductionistic. Given that, within the broader context of Epicurean philosophy,  this strong naturalistic tendency was also coupled with an overt attack on both  religion and superstition, it comes as little surprise that Epicurean atomism was  an anathema to early Christianity and that this philosophical school essentially  disappeared after 500 AD. Indeed it is remarkable that anything managed to  survive at all.   Though often applied to physical processes, such as weathering, evaporation  and filtration, there are no examples of the application of ancient atomism to  phenomena that we would today classify as chemical and hence our survey of its  gradual modification and influence on chemistry does not truly begin until the  17th century.

Pines, Shlomo (1997), Studies in Islamic Atomism, Magnes Press:  Jerusalem.   17th-Century Mechanical Atomism  While printed editions of both Diogenes Laertius and Lucretius were available   by the 15th centuryâthe first editions appearing in 1472 and 1473 respectivelyâit  was not until the 17th century that atomism began to seriously impact on European  science. A necessary prerequisite for this process was the \"Christianization\" of  Epicurean atomism through elimination of its more objectionable assumptions,  much as Thomas Aquinas and the scholastics had done four centuries earlier for the  writings of Aristotle. This task was undertaken by the French priest and scientist,  Pierre Gassendi, and by his English imitator, Walter Charleton, in the period 1640- 1660. Atoms were no longer self-existent entities whose fortuitious collisions led  to the creation of both the universe and man himself, but rather were instead created  by God and directed by him for his own predetermined purposes. Boyle did much  the same by the simple expedient of dissociating atomism from the despised names  of both Epicurus and Lucretius and referring to it instead as either the \"corpuscular  doctrine\" or the \"Phoenician doctrine.\"   The revival of atomism in the 17th century is actually quite complex and  involved not only the true mechanical atomism of Epicurus, but also various  hybridized versions based largely on the reification and atomization of the older  Aristotelian and Platonic theories of forms and seminal principles. Within   9  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nthese hybridized versions, atoms could act as the inherent carriers of such  secondary properties as color, taste, acidity, hotness and even coldness. These  corpuscularized qualities would eventually evolve into the imponderable fluids  much beloved of the 18th- and early 19th-century theorist, of which phlogiston  and caloric are perhaps the best known examples.   In addition, several new forms of atomism or corpuscularism were also  introduced, the most famous of which were Descartes' plenum theory and  Newton's dynamic atomism, both of which rejected one or more of the basic  assumptions of Epicurean atomism. Thus Descartes rejected both a lower limit  to particle divisibility and the existence of an interparticle vacuum or void,  as well as insisting on a strong dichotomy between matter and soul, whereas  Newton replaced mechanical entanglement with short-range interparticle forces  of attraction and repulsion.   It is well known that Robert Boyle was the major proponent of the application  of particulate or corpuscular theories to chemical phenomena in the 17th-century,  though neither he nor his contemporaries were able to develop a specific form  of the theory which could be meaningfully related to quantitative chemical data.  As a consequence, the true impact of mechanical corpuscularism on 17th-century  chemistry was largely indirect and is best illustrated, as J. E. Marsh observed many  years ago, in terms of its application to the acid-alkali theory of salt formation.   The reaction between various acids and various alkalis or metallic carbonates  first attracted the attention of iatrochemical writers as a possible chemical model  for the processes of digestion. Ignoring the carbon dioxide gas that was generated,  which they misinterpreted as a violent churning or mechanical motion of the  interacting particles, they viewed this reaction as a simple addition:   acid + alkali = salt   Acids were thought to have sharp, pointed particles, which accounted for their sour  taste and ability to attack or corrode substances, whereas alkalis were thought to  have porous particles. Neutralization and salt formation consisted in the points  of the acid particles becoming mechanically wedged in the pores of the alkali  particles, thus blunting or neutralizing their properties (Figure 1).   The importance of this theory for chemistry, however, did not lie in this  mechanical mechanism for neutralization, but rather in the fact that it gradually  accustomed chemists to the idea of characterizing salts in terms of their component  acid and alkali particles rather than in terms of property-bearing principles and  to looking at acid-alkali reactions as exchanges between preexisting material  components, rather than in terms of the generation and corruption of alternative  abstract forms or essences. This newer way of looking at neutralization reactions  can be found in the writing of many 17th-century chemists, including Glauber,  Lemery, Sylvius, Tachenius, and especially John Mayow, who would cite a  laboratory example of the analysis and synthesis of various nitrate salts interpreted  in terms of the separation and addition of their component acids and alkali  particles.   10  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 1.

However, it was not until the first decade of the 18th century  that this new dynamic or force model was first specifically applied to chemical  phenomena by the British chemists, John Freind and John Keill, and by Newton  himself in the finalized version of the 31st query appended to the 1717 and later  editions of his famous treatise on optics, where he succinctly summarized his new  particulate program for chemistry:   There are therefore Agents in Nature able to make the Particles of Bodies  stick together by strong Attractions.

Geoffroy's 1718 affinity table for single displacement reactions  interpreted as particle interchanges.   Meanwhile the particulate approach to chemical reactions, first realized in  the 17th-century theory of acid-alkali neutralizations, was applied to chemical  reactions in general, which were now being routinely classified as simple additions,  simple decompositions, single displacements, and double displacementsâan  advance difficult to imagine within the older context of the theory of forms  and essences which had dominated chemical thought for centuries. In addition,  empirical observations concerning the observed outcomes of single displacement  reactions were being tabulated, starting with the work of Geoffroy in 1718, in the  form of so-called \"affinity tables\" (Figure 2), as well as in a series of textbook  statements known as the \"laws of chemical affinity\" (e.g, Macquer 1749).   It was not long before this empirical concept of chemical affinity became  associated with the concept of Newtonian short-range interparticle forces, an  identification best expressed in Bergman's 1775 monograph, A Dissertation on  Elective Attractions, and in attempts, now known to be flawed, by such chemists  as Guyton de Morveau, Wenzel, and Kirwan to quantitatively measure these  forcesâattempts which also culminated in an early precursor of the chemical  equation known as an \"affinity diagram\" (Figure 3).   12  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nSulfate  of   fotafli.

As the concept of the Newtonian force atom came to dominate 18th-century  chemical atomism, the parameter of atomic shape, so important to 17th-century  mechanical atomism, faded and chemists and physicists came to more and more  think of atoms as sphericalâa view which reached its most extreme form in Roger  Boscovitch's 1763 monograph, Theoria philosophiae naturalis, in which the atom  was reduced to an abstract point for the convergence of a series of complex centro- symmetric force fields (Figure 4).   13  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nSelect Bibliography of Books Dealing with Eighteenth-Century  Dynamic Atomism   â¢ Duncan, Alistair (1996), Laws and Order in Eighteenth-Century  Chemistry, Clarendon: Oxford.

By the end of the 18th century it was possible to characterize the chemical  composition of a species at the molar level in terms of its composition by weight,  or, in the case of gases, by its composition by volume. Thus one could speak of  water as being composed of 11.11% hydrogen and 88.89% oxygen by weight or  of 66.67% hydrogen and 33.33% oxygen by volume. With the introduction of  the atomic weight concept, however, one could now characterize the composition  of a species at the molecular level in terms of the relative number of component  atoms and so speak of water as composed of molecules containing a ratio of two  hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom.   The key to Dalton's compositional revolution was the ability to link atomic  weights at the molecular level with gravimetric composition measured at the molar  level using his so-called \"rules of simplicity.\" These, however, were soon shown to  be operationally flawed and nearly a half century would pass before this problem  was finally solved in a satisfactory manner by Cannizzaro in 1858 and accepted by  the chemical community at the Karlsruhe conference of 1860. This final resolution  of the problem of chemical composition was, of course, soon brilliantly elaborated  by the rise of chemical structure theory and classical stereochemistry during the  last quarter of the 19th century. The story of these advances is, of course, far more  complex and nuanced then suggested by this brief summary and aspects of it will  no doubt be covered in greater detail by other speakers in this symposium.   14  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nSelect Bibliography of Books Dealing with Nineteenth-Century  Gravimetric Atomism   â¢ Bradley, John (1992), Before and After Cannizzaro: A Philosophical  Commentary on the Development of the Atomic and Molecular Theories,  Whittles Publishing: Caithness, UK.

Atomic motion was, of course, always a part of the atomic  theory from ancient atomism onward. However, it functioned primarily as a  way of explaining diffusion and providing a means for bringing about sufficient  contact between particles to facilitate either mechanical entanglement or the  engagement of short-range forces of attraction and repulsion. Aside from this  minimal function, motion played little role in explaining the properties of things in  either 17th-century mechanical atomism or in 18th-century dynamical atomism.   Thus, within the context of the Newtonian force atom and the caloric theory  of heat, solids, liquids, and gases were all viewed as organized arrays of particles  produced by a static equilibrium between the attractive interparticle forces, on the  one hand, and the repulsive intercaloric forces, on the other. The sole difference  was that the position of equilibrium became greater as one passed from the solid to  the liquid to the gas, due to the increasing size of the caloric envelopes surrounding  the component atoms (Figures 5 and 6).   Likewise, Berthollet's original concept of chemical equilibrium, introduced  in the years 1799-1803, was also based on the concept of a static equilibrium  between those forces favoring the formation of the products versus those favoring  the formation of the reactants. As is well known, this static model made it very  difficult to rationalize the law of mass action without coming into conflict with  the law of definite composition. This static view of both states of matter and  chemical equilibrium, viewed as a competition between chemical affinity and  caloric repulsions, continued to dominate chemical thought throughout the first  half of the 19th century.   15  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nMatter I  Combined Caloric  Uncombined Calorl   M  (Solid) (Liquid) (Gas)   Figure 5.

The first known attempt to envision gas pressure in terms of a kinetic  model of atoms and molecules. (From D. Bernoulli, Hydrodynamica, 1738).   Though a kinetic model of gases had been proposed by Bernoulli as early  as 1738 (Figure 7) and was unsuccessfully revived by Herapath (1821) and  Waterson (1845) in the first half of the 19th century, it was not until the 1850s and  1860s that it began to attract widespread acceptance through the work of Kronig  (1856) and Clausms (1857) in Germany and Joule (1848) and Maxwell (1859)  in England. Heat was no longer a self-repulsive imponderable fluid but rather a  measure of the average kinetic energy of molecular motions. States of matter were  no longer the result of a static equilibrium between attractive interparticle forces  and repulsive intercaloric forces, but rather the result of a dynamic equilibrium  between attractive interparticle forces and disruptive thermal motions. Solids,  liquids and gases no longer shared a common structure, differing only in their  distance of intermolecular equilibration, but now differed in terms of both their  degree of intermolecular organization and their freedom of motion. Chemical  equilibrium and mass action were no longer a static equalization of opposing  forces, but rather a dynamic equilibrium based on relative collision frequencies  and differing threshold energies for reactionâa view first qualitatively outlined  by the Austrian physicist, Leopold Pfaundler, in 1867.   Thus by 1895, the German chemist, Lothar Meyer, would conclude the short  version of his textbook of theoretical chemistry with the observation that:   Chemical theories grow more and more kinetic.   a trend which would culminate in the development of classical statistical  mechanics by Boltzmann and Gibbs by the turn of the century and which would  continue unabated throughout the 20th century.   17  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nSelect Bibliography of Books Dealing with Nineteenth-Century  Kinetic Atomism   â¢ Brush, Stephen (2003), The Kinetic Theory of Gases: An Anthology of  Classic Papers with Historical Commentary, Imperial College Press:  River Edge, NJ.   â¢ Brush, Stephen (1986), The Kind of Motion We Call Heat: A History of  the Kinetic Theory of Gases in the 19th Century, 2 Vols., North Holland;  Amsterdam.   20th-century Electrical Atomism  With the advent of the 20th-century we see the solid, impenetrable, billard-  ball atom of the previous centuries replaced by the diffuse, quantized electrical  atom (Figures 8 and 9). Nevertheless the various atomic parameters emphasized  by earlier variants of atomism have all retained their importance in one way or  another:   Like 17th-century mechanical atomism, modern atomism also recognizes the  importance of shapeâat the level of individual atoms in terms of the concept of  orbital hybridization and directional bondingâand at the molecular level in terms  of the lock and key model of intermolecular interactions.   Like 18th-century dynamical atomism, modern atomism also recognizes  the importance of short-range interparticle forcesânow interpreted in terms of  electrical forces of attraction and repulsion between negatively charged electrons  and positively charged nuclei.

A modern statistical picture of the electron cloud of a hydrogen atom.   Like 19th-century gravimetric atomism, the concept of atomic weight and the  laws of stoichiometry are still the cornerstones of chemical compositionâalbeit  now modified to accommodate the concepts of isotopes and relativistic mass  effects.   Like 19th-century kinetic atomism, molecular motion still forms the  cornerstone of our modern understanding of heat, thermodynamics, kinetics, and  statistical mechanics, but now also plays a key role in our understanding of the  internal structure of the atom itself, via the concept of quantized electron motions.

Kanada developed  an atomic theory in India where five elements were known,  air, water, fire, earth, and space. In the Mediterranean (Greek)  region, Democritus and Leucippus are considered to be the  founders of the atomism in the fifth century BCE. Aristotle did  not accept the atomic theory but did accept the four elements,  air, water, earth, and fire. Among the Arab alchemists, there was  little interest except for followers of Kalam who developed an  atomic theory. In Europe, the Aristotelian view dominated until  the sixteenth century CE. The four elements of Empedocles  (earth, air, water, fire) or the three principles of Paracelsus  (mercury, sulfur, salt) were not included in Lavoisier's Table of  Simple Substances in 1789 CE. In the eighteenth century, there  was the revival of the ancient Greek atomism in the guise of  corpuscularism preceding the atomism of John Dalton.   The notion of atoms arrived in the East, ancient India, prior to its appearance  in the West, the ancient Mediterranean (Greek) world. Both societies were  polytheistic, and philosopher-chemists dominated the study of chemistry. Atomic  concepts were based upon philosophical considerations and not experimental  observations. No exchange on atomism between these two regions in this  ancient time has been detected, indicating that these concepts were developed  independently (1). These developments occurred during Period I of the Ancient  Regime of Chemistry (-10,000 BCE - -100 BCE), which may be called the   Â© 2010 American Chemical Society  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nera of Philosophical Chemistry because the philosophers of the time were the  theoretical chemists. Of course, there were other forms of chemistry that were  practiced. For example, the first recorded industrial chemists were two women,  Tapputi-Belatekallim, the Perfumeress and .. .Ninu, the Perfumeress, in Babylonia  in about 2000 BCE. The full name of ...Ninu is not known due to lacunae in a  cuneiform tablet, which was written in Akkadian, the language of Mesopotamia  during the reign of Tukulti-Ninurti I (1256-1209 BCE) (2).   Indian Atomism   The atomic concept developed differently in the various religions prevalent  in ancient India. These views survived until after the British conquest in the  18th century when the educational system was revamped to emulate the British  educational system.   Hinduism   In the Bhagavad Gita, one of the holy books of Hindus, which was written  between 300 and 500 BCE (3), a reference to atoms appears inverse 9, chapter 8. It  is written in Sanskrit: kavim puranam anusasitaram anor aniyamsam anusmared  yah sarvasya dhataram acintya-rupam aditya-varnam tamasah parastat, where  anor refers to atom. One translation is (4): He who meditates on the one who  is all-perceiving, the ancient, the ruler of all things, smaller than the atom, the  supporter of this universe, whose form is inconceivable, who is as radiant as the  sun beyond the darkness. Swami Prabhupada (5) offfers a different translation:  \"One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything,  as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest,  who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who  is inconceivable, and who is always a person. He is luminous like the sun and,  being transcendental, is beyond this material nature.\" In his commentary on this  verse (5), he states \"He is called the smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme,  He can enter into the atom.\"   Kanada, a Nyaya-Vaisheshika philosopher, who lived -600 BCE, considered  that matter was composed of four types of atoms, earth, fire, air, and water. Atoms  reacted with the aid of an invisible force (adrsta) to form biatomic molecules and  triatomic molecules (6-8). He stated that there were five elements: earth, fire, air,  water, and space. Each atom also had qualities such as odor, taste, color and a  sense of touch (8).   Jainism   In Jaina atomism (-900 BCE), the atom was the indivisible particle of matter.  Each atom had attributes such as color, taste, and odor, as well as tactile qualities  such as roughness or moistness. Atoms existed in space. The combination of  atoms was produced by the differences in attributes such as roughness (8).   22  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nBuddhism   In the Sarvastivadin school of Buddhism (-400 BCE), the minimum  indivisible particle of matter was called the atom, which expresses the nature of  matter. The characteristic atoms were earth (solid), water (liquid), fire (heat), air  (moving), color, taste, odor, and sense of touch, and they existed in space. The  smallest composite unit was considered to be composed of seven characteristic  atoms, which are set at the apices and center of octahedron (8).   Chinese Atomism  Based upon Taoist philosophy, alchemy in China developed. Although there   is not any literature concerning atomism among the ancient Chinese alchemists,  five elements (Wu Xing) were acknowledged in the twelfth century BCE. These  elements were water, fire, wood, gold or metal, and earth. The elements were  frequently associated or matched with other sets of five, such as virtues, tastes,  colors, tones, and the like (9). In about 1910, modern atomism probably came to  China when Sun Yat Sen introduced modern European education.   Mediterranean (Greek) Atomism  On the other side of the Ancient world, thinking about atoms was initiated by   Sanchuniathon of Sidon in Phoenicia around 1200 BCE (10). As first principles,  he considered air and ether. Poseidonios (135-51 BCE) stated that Sanchuniathon  \"originated the ancient opinion about atoms\" according to Strabo, a geographer  and writer in the ancient world (10). Robert Boyle in the seventh century, CE,  noted that Mochus or Moschus of Sidon was the first to devise an \"atomical  hypothesis\" (11). This Moschus should not be confused with the poet of the same  name of Syracuse (12) nor the philosopher of the same name of Elis (13), both  of whom lived at a later period.   Four Elements   North of Phoenicia on the west coast of Asia Minor in the city of Miletus,  Thales (630-550 BCE), the first Greek philosopher, taught that the primary  substance was water on which the earth floats, and all things contain gods (14).  His pupil, Anaximander or Aleximandros (611-545 BCE) replaced water with  apeiron (15). The primary substance according to Anaximenes (585-525 BCE),  who succeeded Anaximander, was air or breath. By condensation, it became  wind, cloud, water, earth, and stone and by rarefaction, fire (16). Fire was the  choice of Heraclitus (540-450 BCE) of Ephesus (Asia Minor) as the primary  substance (17). Xenophanes (550-450 BCE ) of nearby Colophon suggested that  earth was the primary substance (18).   On the island of Sicily in the city of Akragos (Agrigentum), Empedocles (483- 430 BCE) proposed a theory of four primordial substance or roots. He associated  them with deities, the identity of which varied with the source; Zeus (air or fire),  Hera (air or earth), Aidoneus (air, earth, or fire), andNestis (water) (19). Each root   23  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nconsisted of particles that were indivisible, homogeneous, changeless, and eternal  with pores (not void) between the particles. The particles move with Love as the  physical agent for mixing of the particles and for their separation, Strife (19). Until  the end of the eigtheenth century, CE, this theory of four elements (seeds) persisted  with the addition of mercury, sulphur, and salt.   First Defined Atomism   In contrast to Eleatic School (Parmenides and Empedocles), Leucippus of  Miletus (-500-? BCE) and his pupil, Democritus of Abdera (460-370 BCE)  introduced the void as being necessary for the motion of corpuscules or atoms.  Atoms are indivisible, solid, full, and compact with various shapes. They also  were in motion and have weight (20).   Born in Athens, using Pythagorarian concepts, Plato (427-347 BCE), a pupil  of Socrates, conceived geometric bodies for the units or particles of the seeds,  which he called elements. Earth units were cubes, fire units, tetrahedrons, air units,  octahedrons, and water units, icosahedrons (21). He did not accept the void but  thought that space existed inside the units. The units of fire, air, and water were  deformable corpuscles. In his dialogue, Timaeus, he wrote \"God placed water and  air in the mean between fire and earth, and made them to have the same proportion  so far as was possible (as fire is to air so is air to water, and as air is to water so is  water to earth); and thus he bound and put together a visible and tangible heaven.  And for these reasons, and out of such elements, which are in number four, the  body of the world was created\" (22).   Aristotle of Stageiros (384-322 BCE) did not agree with his teacher's  geometric bodies for the different elements. He rejected the Democritian atoms in  which matter was considered a principle but form was a secondary characteristic.  Nor did he accept the existence of a void. According to the Aristotelian view,  the four elements arose from the action on primordial matter by pairs of qualities  (warm + dry, fire, warm + moist, air, cold + dry, earth, cold + moist, water). He  introduced another element, ether, as a divine substance of which the heavens and  stars are made (23).   Lucretius (Titus Lucretius Cams, ~99 BCE - ~55 CE) of Rome wrote a poem,  De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things) (24) in which he described the  atomic theory of Epicurus of Samos (342-271 BCE). For Epicurus, atoms were  indivisible, invisible, and indestructible, and they differ in size, shape and weight.  He believed that a void exists because there can be no motion of the atoms without  it. The motions of atoms included the downward motion of free atoms because of  their weight, \"swerve,\" the deviation of atomic motion from straight downward  paths, and \"blow,\" which results from collisions and motion in compound bodies.  Lucretius called atoms poppy seeds, bodies, principals, and shapes (25).   Galen of Pergamum (129-216 CE) rejected the atomic theory because the  grouping of atoms could not explain why the properties of a compound differed  from the properties of its constituents (26). His rejection effectively exiled  atomism in the Western world in which the views of Aristotle prevailed until the  seventeenth century, CE (27).   24  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nIn 1615 CE, Cardinal Robert Bellarmine in his book, The Mind's Ascent to  God, searched nature for lessons for the soul. No mention of atomism appeared.  Sixty-five years later, Ralph Cudworth summarized a hypothesis of the time called  atomical, corpuscular, or mechanical in his book, The True Intellectual System of  the Universe (28). Atomism had returned. How did this happen?   Alchemy  The second period of the Ancient Regime of Chemistry, alchemy, alchemi,   alchimi or chymistry, began -100 BCE and continued until the end of the  eighteenth century, CE. In Egypt, the priests engaged in secret alchemical  operations. As a result of this association of alchemy with the priests, alchemy  became identified with magic. After Rome conquered Egypt and Emperor  Constantine converted to Christianity, the administration of the empire was  dominated by Christians intolerant of those who did not agree with the official  views. Many of the alchemists were Gnostics exiled from the Roman Empire in  the fifth century, CE. Also expelled were the Nestorians who carried the writings  of the Greek philosophers, which were translated into Syrian in Persia. After  Mohammad's death in 632 CE, his followers from Arabia created an empire  from Persia to Spain. In Persia, the Greek texts including alchemical tracts were  translated into Arabic (29).   Arabian Atomism   There was little interest in atomism except for the followers of the philosophy  of Kalam (Arabic: speech). Among the main proponents were the Mutazilites  (from i'tazala, to separate oneself, to dissent). Of the twelve propositions of  Kalam, the first nine were directly related to atoms. These propositions include:   \"All things are composed of atoms that are indivisible, and when atoms  combine, they form bodies.\"   \"There is a vacuum.\"  \"Time is composed of time-atoms\"  \"Substances cannot exist without accidents\". Accidents are properties such   as color, taste, motion or rest, and combination or separation.  \"Atoms are furnished with accidents and cannot exist without them\"  \"Accidents do not continue in existence during two time-atoms. God creates   substances and the accidents\" (30).   Medieval European Alchemy   In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in Europe, Greek and Arab texts were  translated from Arabic into Latin, the literary language of Europe. The first  translation of an alchemical book from Arabic, The Book of the Composition of  Alchemy, was prepared by Robert of Chester in 1144 CE in Spain (31). To the  Four Elements, air, water, fire, and earth, Arab alchemists added mercury and  sulfur. Paracelsus considered mercury and sulfur as principles along with salt   25  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\n(32). Aristotelian atomism was the only view accepted by the alchemists and  the authorities (Catholic Church). Few if any references to atoms were made by  alchemists in their writings. For example, in The Ordinall of Alchemy (1477) by  Thomas Norton of Bristoll, atoms are mentioned once in the 123 pages (33):   Substance resolving in Attomes with wonder   Sympathizers and Atomists of the Twelfth to the Fourteenth Centuries, CE   The sympathizers, Adelard of Bath (died -1150 CE) and Thierry of Chartres  (died -1155 CE), accepted the four elements of the Greeks and that atoms or  corpuscles were involved with them. Atoms were fundamental constituents of  substances according to Constantine the African of Carthage (twelfth century,  CE). William of Conches (1080-1154 CE) recognized God's action as giving  rise to the laws of nature and regarded atoms as \"first principles\" and \"simple  and extremely small particles\" (34). Critizing Aristotelian physics, William of  Ockham (1399-1350 CE) stated that substance had matter and form; its qualities  result from elementary particles that can be construed to be atoms. In 1340 CE,  his views were condemned by the Church as was those of Nicholas of Autrecourt  (1300-1350 CE) in 1347 CE. Nicholas considered matter to be eternal, consisting  of invisible atoms that are in motion; generation and corruption of substances  occurs by the rearrangement of atoms (34).   In the early fifteenth century (1417 CE), De Rerum Natura by Lucretius was  rediscovered. It was printed fifty-six years later in 1473 CE reintroducing the  Epicurian concept of the atom and void to the western world (35).   Atomists of the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth Centuries, CE   One of the first atomists in the sixteenth century was Jean Bodin (1530-1596  CE) who considered atoms to be indivisible bodies with motion and that an infinite  force was necessary for the division of atoms (36).   Giordano Bruno (1548-1600 CE) was a member of the Dominican order. His  views on atoms had both metaphysical and physical aspects: atoms are both the  ultimate, indeterminate, substance of things and a hypothesis that can be used to  explain variety in the material world (even though only earth, among the four  elements, has atoms). Each kind of being had a \"minimum\" or unit, although only  God is a true monad; the point was the minimum of space, the atom the minimum  of matter. Bruno's atoms are spherical, and their motions due to a soul in each. He  was burnt alive for heresy on February 17, 1600, in Rome (37).   A professor of medicine at Wittenberg, Daniel Sennert (1572-1637 CE)  developed a version of atomism from experimental observations rather than  philosophical considerations. Based upon sublimation, solution, and petrifaction,  for example, the mixtures of gold-silver alloy and silver dissolved in acid, he  concluded that there were corpuscles or \"minima\" that were divisible, and the  four elements had them (36, 38).   The atomism of Sebastian Basso (17th century, CE), a French physician, was  based upon Democritus atomism with no void. He considered all bodies created   26  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nby God to consist of exceedingly small atoms of different natures with the spaces  between particles filled with a subtle spirit. The element fire consisted of fine and  sharp corpuscles (37, 39).   Not an ardent supporter of Democritian atomism, Sir Francis Bacon, first  Viscount St. Alban, (1561-1626 CE) was also a lawyer and member of the English  government. He considered atoms to be true or useful for demonstration but he  did not accept the void. The properties of bodies were explained by the size and  shape of corpuscles and not the indivisible atoms. Force or motion was implanted  by God in the first particles (40).   Isaac Beeckman (1588-1637 CE), a Dutch natural philosopher, proposed a  \"molecular\" theory in his \"scientific diary\". He assumed that there were four kinds  of atoms corresponding to the four elements of the one sole primordial matter.  He considered these atoms to be the cause of the properties of the substances,  for example, color, taste, smell, etc. The molecules of substances were called  homogenea physica (physical homogenea) and were composed of the atoms in  specific spatial structure. His private diary was available to several savants such  as Descartes, who acknowledged these ideas in several books (41).   Another atomist, prosecuted by the Italian church authorities, was Galileo  Galilei (1564-1642 CE). He initially used minimi to describe the smallest parts  of substances but later applied the term to Epicurean atoms separated by a  quantitatively infinite vacuum. The atomic structure of substances was necessary  from mathematical reasoning, and the atom was indivisible without shape and  dimensions. The qualities or properties (color, odor, taste, etc.) of atoms were not  associated with atoms but with their sensory detection by the observer (42).   Two French contemporary students of the atomic theory were Pierre Gassendi  (1592-1655 CE) and Rene Descartes (1596-1650 CE). Gassendi, a priest, was an  atomist for whom atoms were primordial, impenetrable, simple, unchangeable,  and indestructible bodies with shape, size, and weight that were set in motion by  God at creation. In addition, he accepted that a vacuum exists, which Torricelli  demonstrated in 1643 (43). In contrast, Descartes did not believe in the void,  but that the material universe consisted of one infinite and continuous extended  matter created by God. Extended matter consisted of a granulated continuum  made of corpuscles. This corpuscular philosophy involved corpuscles that were  deformable and divisible, having shapes, sizes, and motion (44). The association  of God with atoms (or at least corpuscles) by Descartes and Gassendi was very  instrumental in the return of Epicurean atomism as the basis of the atomic theory,  and in 1678, Cudworth could include atomism in his book, The True Intellectual  System of the Universe (28). Atomism had returned.   Nicholas Lemery (1645-1715 CE) was a corpuscularian who favored a five- element theory (water, spirit, oil, salt, and earth). His acid/alkali theory invoked  spikes on an acid that interacted with the pores of the base. In 1675 CE in Paris, he  published Cours de Chymie, a textbook that was translated into English, German,  Italian, Latin, and Spanish and was popular for more than fifty years. In this book,  he espoused the Cartesian corpuscular mechanism (45).   The corpuscularism of the Honorable Robert Boyle (1627-1691 CE) was  based upon the theories of Descartes and Gassendi. He considered that matter  was composed of corpuscles of different shapes, sizes, motion or rest, and solidity   27  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nor impenetrability that are created by God. The four elements of Empedocles  (earth, air, water, fire) or the three principles of Paracelsus (mercury, sulfur, salt)  were not regarded as elements by him because he did not consider any of these  to be fundamental constituents of existing bodies. However, he did not describe  any elements. He exerted an extremely important influence on the development  of chemistry as a science in the seventeenth century (46).   The prominent physicist, Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727 CE), was also an  alchemist. His theory of matter was in agreement with the atomism of Epicurus  and Boyle including the existence of the void. In Query 31, Book 3, of Opticks,  he wrote \"All these things being consider'd, it seems probable to me, that God  in the Beginning form'd Matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable Particles, of  such Sizes and Figures, and with such other Properties, and in such Proportion  to Space, as most conduced to the End for which he form'd them\" (47). God's  continual presence was also necessary for their continued existence. Newton  assumed that the forces in corpuscles were not only gravitational but also had  electrical, magnetic, attractive, and repulsive components (48).   Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich (1711-1787 CE), a Jesuit priest, replaced  corpuscles with force-atoms (1758 CE) or point-centers of alternating attractive  and repulsive forces. The views of Father Boscovich were similar to those of  Newton, the Hindu atomists of the Nyaya-Vaisheshika, and the Arab followers  oftheKalam(4P).   The Russian atomist, Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov (1711-1765 CE)  believed that changes of matter were due to the motions of constituent particles.  The particles consisted of \"elementa\" that contain no smaller bodies of different  kinds. If a corpuscle (a small mass consisting of aggregates of elementa) consisted  of the same elementa, it was homogeneous. If the components of the corpuscles  were different elementa, the corpuscles were heterogeneous (50).   Bryan Higgins (1737 or 1741-1818) applied Newton's repulsion of atoms  in air to simple and compound gases, and suggested that there were caloric  atmospheres around molecules of compound gases (51). Many of his ideas were  promoted by his nephew, William Higgins (1762/3-1825), who anticipated parts  of Dalton's atomic theory and law of multiple proportions in 1789 (52). In 1814,  he wrote (53):   These considerations gave birth to that doctrine which Mr. Dalton,  eighteen years after I had written, claimed as originating from his own  inventive genius. What his pretensions are will be seen from the sketches  which will soon follow, and which have been taken from my book.   A controversy ensued concerning the awarding of credit with Dalton being  remembered rather than Higgins (54).   In 1789, Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794 CE) published a Table of  Simple Substances (p. 175-176) in his book Traite elementaire cle Chimie,presente  dans un ordre nouveau at d'apres les decouvertes modernes, (55). The subtitle to  the table was \"Simple substances belonging to all the kingdom of nature, which  may be considered as the elements of bodies\". None of the four elements of  Empedocles (earth, air, water, fire) or the three principles of Paracelsus (mercury,   28  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nsulfur, salt) were included except for caloric one of whose old names was fire.  On page xxiv, he wrote that \"if by the term elements, we mean to express those  simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable  we know nothing at all about them.\" Thus, the Ancient Regime of Alchemy was  overthrown, and the science of chemistry replaced it.

Lewis*   Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire,  Eau Claire, WI 54702   iewisd@uwec.edu   In 1858, a pair of papers were published that were to change the  way that organic chemists thought about the compounds they  dealt with. The first to appear was a paper by Friedrich August  Kekule and the second, which appeared only slightly afterward,  was by a brilliant young Scotsman, Archibald Scott Couper.  Three years later, Aleksandr Mikhailovich Butlerov presented  his own form of the theory in a more usable form, and used  it not only to rationalize the chemistry of known compounds,  but to predict the existence of new compounds. Unlike modern  structural theory, none of the principals involved thought of  the structures as having a physical meaning, but, instead,  made a clear distinction between the chemical structure of the  compound, which could be deduced from its bonding affinities,  and its physical structure, which could not.   Introduction  The year 2008 was the sesquicentennial of a major milestone in the   development of organic chemistry. Separated by just a few weeks in 1858,  two papers appeared, setting out the basic principles of what is known today  as the structural theory of organic chemistry. The first paper, chronologically,  was by a young professor at the beginning of his independent career, Friedrich  August Kekule (1829-1896). This paper (1), \"Ueber die Constitution und die  Metamorphosen der chemischen Verbindungen, und iiber die chemische Natur  des Kohlenstoffs,\" was received by the editor of the Annalen der Chemie und  Pharmacie on March 16, 1858, and published in May that year. The second to  appear was a paper by a young Scotsman, Archibald Scott Couper (1831-1892),  who was a student working in the Paris laboratory of Charles Adolphe Wurtz   Â© 2010 American Chemical Society  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\n(1817-1884). This paper (2), \"Surune nouvelle theorie chimique,\" was eventually  presented before the Academie des Sciences by Dumas, and published in the  Comptes rendus on June 14, 1858, six weeks after Kekule's paper appeared.  Wurtz was not a member of the Academie at that time, and therefore could not  present the paper himself without the sponsorship of a member (usually Balard).  Whatever its cause, Wurtz' delay in finding a sponsor brought Couper to a fury,  with far-reaching consequences.   In both papers two key ideas were set forth â 1) the idea of the tetravalent  carbon atom, and 2) the concept of catenation (that carbon atoms could form  chains). Both papers also stated explicitly, for the first time, what became known  as the chemical structure of a compound, and the idea that the properties of the  compounds depended on the properties and arrangement of their component  atoms, rather than the more complex (and less well defined) radicals. The  appearance of these papers also resulted in a polemical interchange over priority  that left Couper a broken man, and boosted Kekule (with the help of Wurtz,  amongst others) to the top echelons of organic chemistry in Europe (3).   Organic Chemistry Prior to 1858: Radicals, Types, and  Substitution   Before we proceed with a discussion of these two papers, it is worthwhile  examining the state of organic chemistry in 1858 - a mere 30 years after Wohler's  serendipitous synthesis of urea while attempting to prepare ammonium cyanate  (4). These three decades had been eventful, seeing, amongst other things, the  first total synthesis of an organic compound from its elements â acetic acid,  by Hermann Kolbe (1818-1884) in 1845 (5) â and the preparation of the first  organometallic compound â diethylzinc, by Edward Frankland (1825-1899) in  1852 (6). (Although Bunsen's cacodyl (7) might be viewed as an organometallic  compound, which would make it the first organometallic compound, arsenic is a  metalloid rather than a true metal like zinc, which makes the claim for diethylzinc  as the first \"truly\" organometallic compound tenable, at least.) At the same time,  progress in organic chemistry was still hampered by the lack of uniformity in  atomic weights during these early years, a situation that was eventually settled  by Stanislao Cannizzarro (1826-1910) in the Karlsruhe Congress of 1860 (8).  Thus, during its developmental stages, much of organic chemistry was described  in terms of equivalent weights, with oxygen having an equivalent weight of 8, and  carbon an equivalent weight of 6. This necessitated the use of \"double atoms\"  of these elements when writing molecular formulas, and barred symbols were  frequently used to represent these atoms. The distinction between an atom and a  molecule had begun with Dalton ((9), although he did not use those explicit terms),  and the distinction between atoms and molecules in gaseous elements had been  made by Amadeo Avogadro (1776-1856) (10) and Andre Marie Ampere (1775- 1836) (11) before their reiterations in 1833 by Ampere's student, Marc Antoine  Augustin Gaudin (1804-1880) (12), and 1846 by Auguste Laurent (1807-1853)  (13); Frankland had introduced the concept of valence in 1852 (14).   36  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nThe first major theory of organic chemistry to follow Wohler's urea synthesis  was his establishment, with his friend Justus von Liebig (1803-1873), of the  concept of the multi-atom organic radical - benzoyl, described in the landmark  paper of 1832 (15). The definition of a radical was further clarified by Liebig in  his 1837 paper, where he defined a radical in terms of three major characteristics  (16):   \"We call cyanogen a radical (1) because it is a non-varying constituent in  a series of compounds, (2) because in these latter it can be replaced by  other simple substances, and (3) because in its compounds with a simple  substance, the latter can be turned out and replaced by equivalents of other  simple substances.\"   In the decade after Liebig and Wohler established the multi-atom radical  as a presence in organic chemistry,the next logical step was being taken by  Laurent (17), Jean-Baptiste Andre Dumas (1800-1884) (18), and Charles Frederic  Gerhardt (1816-1856) (19), who were developing substitution theory, and its  logical offshoot, type theory (20). Dumas, especially, had been struck by the  fact that trichloroacetic acid was, in almost all respects, chemically analogous  to acetic acid, and he suggested that one might be able to substitute hydrogen  in an organic substance by halogen without appreciably affecting its chemistry.  He confirmed this by studies wherein he chlorinated oil of turpentine (21) and  alcohol (22). This was at odds with the dualistic theory of Berzelius (23) and  with the experience of inorganic chemistry, where the substitution of hydrogen  by halogen usually gave rise to dramatic changes in its chemical properties (one  need only compare sodium chloride with sodium hydride). Dumas also expanded  this suggestion to other elements, noting the similarities in the properties of  potassium permanganate and potassium perchlorate. Substitution theory did not  sit well with the German schools of organic chemistry, however, and this led to  the famous (infamous) parody written in French by Wohler, under the pseudonym  S. C. H. Windier (i.e. Schwindler, a swindler or mountebank), in which every  atom of manganous acetate was replaced by chlorine â a reductio ad absurdum  of Dumas' ideas (24). Within a decade, however, the work of Alexander William  Williamson (1824-1904), whose work defined the \"water type,\" (25) and August  Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818-1892), whose work on what he called the volatile  bases defined the \"ammonia type,\" (26) had produced results that validated type  theory, and allowed Gerhardt to publish what became known as the \"Newer Type  Theory,\" (2 7) which today we would probably describe as classification according  to functional group.   1858 - The Pivotal Year   By 1858, the stage was set for the emergence of structure theory. This  involved, as pointed out earlier, a pair of critical insights into the bonding in  carbon compounds â what we now call the tetravalence of carbon, and its  propensity for catenation. It should be pointed out at this stage, also, that neither   37  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nKekule nor Couper intended the structures they wrote to be interpreted as having  any significance as ^physical representation of the molecule. Like Butlerov after  them, they were careful to distinguish between physical and chemical structure.  The caveat implied here was that the structures drawn indicated the chemical  locations of the atoms, and may or may not correspond to the physical positions  of those same atoms in the molecule; atoms close together \"chemically\" were  not necessarily close together physically. In other words, the structures were  actually maps of the linkages between the \"affinities\" of the individual atoms in  the molecule.   Like their contemporaries, none of the major protagonists in the early debates  about chemical structure believed that it was possible (at that time, at least) to  determine or deduce the physical locations of atoms in a molecule or radical. In  some ways, therefore, this clear distinction between the chemical and physical  structure of the molecule may have been a way to temper criticism of the new  ideas by their more conservative contemporaries, and thus render the concept more  palatable to a wider audience of chemists.   Friedrich August Kekule   The first paper to appear during the pivotal year of 1858 was Kekule's paper  in the Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie. Kekule, shown in Figure 1, was born  in Darmstadt. From 1848-1851 he studied architecture at Giessen. Here he came  under the influence of Liebig, who persuaded him to change his focus to chemistry.  He followed his education at Giessen with studies in Paris (1851-1852) and  London (1854-1855). In Paris he studied under August Andre Thomas Cahours  (1813-1891), Charles Adolphe Wurtz (1817-1884), and-significantly-Gerhardt;  in London, he worked in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital laboratory of John  Stenhouse (1809-1880), and met and befriended Williamson and William Odling  (1829-1921). It was during his time in London that he began to develop his  theory of molecular architecture (structure theory). On his return to the continent,  he worked first as a Privatdozent in Heidelberg, and then, in 1858, he moved to  Ghent as professor. In 1867, he moved to a chair at Bonn, and remained there the  rest of his life.   Kekule had actually first set out the concept of the tetravalence of carbon  explicitly in a footnote in a paper published in 1857: \"Carbon is, as may easily  be shown, and as I shall explain in greater detail on a later occasion, tetrabasic or  tetratomic; that is, 1 atom of carbon = C = 12, is equivalent to 4 at. H. The simplest  compound of carbon with an element of the first group, with H or CI for example,  is accordingly: CH4 and CCL\" (28). In his 1858 paper, Kekule expanded on this  idea, and set out explicitly what he intended his theory to accomplish: \"I regard  it as necessary and, in the present state of chemical knowledge, as in many cases  as possible, to explain the properties of chemical compounds by going back to the  elements themselves which compose those compounds. I no longer regard it as  the chief problem of the time, to prove the presence of atomic groups which, on  the strength of certain properties, may be regarded as radicals... I hold that we  must extend our investigation to the constitution of the radicals themselves... As   38  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nmy starting point, I take the views I developed earlier concerning the nature of the  elements and the basicity of atoms\" (29).   In his 1858 paper, Kekule also set forth a notation for representing organic  reactions, in which the reactants and products were shown in the form of type  formulas. In Kekule's notation, the reactants were arranged vertically on the  left, and the products were arranged vertically on the right. Figure 2 illustrates  this notation for the hydrolysis of succinimide to succinamic acid, along with an  interpretation of the original Kekule formulas using lines to indicate bonds and  with the modern representation of the same reaction using full structural formulas.   Kekule's paper specifies four types of reactions, although much of the body of  the paper focuses on metathesis (double decomposition) reactions, implying that  they are most important. In the example above, the reaction is written as just such  a reaction. Kekule's paper specifies, for the first time, that the atoms in radicals are  bound together in an explicit arrangement (in terms of their chemical affinities),  although he did not take the further step to specify that each chemical substance  has a single, unique structure. That was left to the Russian, Butlerov.   The clearest statement of the importance of structure comes towards the end  of Kekule's paper, in a section entitled, \"Constitution der Radikale. Natur des  Kohlenstoffs. [The constitution of radicals and the nature of carbon].\" In this  section, Kekule clearly expounds the ability of carbon to bind to itself, making  the point that carbon is tetravalent (in his terminology, it has four chemical [i.e.  affinity] units) so a C2 unit is hexavalent, and a C5 unit has 12 chemical units, and  so forth; at the end of this same paragraph, he deduces the 2Â«+2 rule for chemical  units associated with n carbon atoms. He then makes the following important  point: \"When, comparisons are made between compounds which have an equal  number of carbon atoms in the molecule and which can be converted into each  other by simple transformations (e.g. alcohol, ethyl chloride, acetaldehyde, acetic  acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid, etc.) the view is reached that the carbon atoms  are arranged in the same way and only the atoms held to the carbon skeleton are  changed\" (29). What is truly remarkable about this paper, given the ferocity with  which Kekule later defended his claim to priority in developing structural theory,  is the way in which he dismisses it in the final paragraph: \"Lastly, I feel bound  to emphasize that I myself attach but a subordinate value to considerations of this  kind... it appears appropriate that these views should be published, because they  seem to me to furnish a simple and reasonably general expression precisely for the  latest discoveries, and because, therefore, their application may perhaps conduce  to the discovery of new facts\" (29).   Archibald Scott Couper   Archibald Scott Couper was born in Kirkintilloch, Scotland, and educated at  home due to his poor health as a child. He followed his early education with study  at the University of Glasgow, where he studied the humanities and languages,  and at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied logic, metaphysics, and  moral philosophy. At some time between 1854 and 1857, he decided to study  chemistry, and he moved to Paris, where he entered the laboratory of Wurtz. Figure  3 shows Couper during his time in Paris. In the space of one year, he published   39  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 1.

Couper's reaction to the delay in finding a  presenter for his paper on structural theory was not temperate, and it resulted in a  serious falling out with Wurtz, and his summary expulsion from Wurtz' laboratory.  (In a letter to Richard Anschiitz, Albert Ladenburg describes Wurtz as having  \"bungled this a little\" (32).) In 1859, he returned to Scotland, where he joined the  laboratory of Lyon Playfair, but a nervous breakdown shortly thereafter ended his  scientific career, and his contributions to structural theory were all but forgotten.  Indeed, Couper would have been forgotten entirely had not his contributions been  rediscovered by (ironically!) Kekule's successor at Bonn, Richard Anschiitz (33).   It is ironic that in his paper presented to the Academie des Sciences , Couper  makes a statement almost identical to one that occurs inKekule's 1858 paper: \"I go  back to the elements themselves, of which I study the mutual affinities. This study  is, in my opinion, sufficient for the explanation of all chemical combinates, without  it being necessary to revert to unknown principles and to arbitrary generalizations.\"  Couper's ultimate goal is most clearly spelled out in the opening paragraph of his  paper in the Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science (34), where he states:  \"The end of chemistry is its theory. The guide in chemical research is a theory. It  is therefore of the greatest importance to ascertain whether the theories at present  adopted by chemists are adequate to the explanation of chemical phenomena, or  are, at least, based upon the true principles which ought to regulate scientific  research.\"   Unlike Kekule's paper, which was careful to maintain a connection with the  earlier work on the theory of Types, and which described an incremental advance  in the theory of chemical structure, Couper's papers completely broke ranks with  Gerhardt's theory of types, and he deliberately set out in his papers to illustrate  the shortcomings of type theory. This he did by using a linguistic analogy to make  the point that type theory does not address the fundamental problem of organic  chemistry, and declared instead that it was important to return to first principles  when discussing organic compounds. Applying this method of analysis to carbon,  he arrived at two critical fundamental principles:   \"- 1Â° It combines with equal numbers of equivalents of hydrogen,  chlorine, oxygen, sulfur, etc., which can be mutually replaced to satisfy  its power of combination.  - 2Â° It enters into combination with itself.  \"These two properties in my opinion explain all that is characteristic  of organic chemistry. I believe that the second is specified here for  the first time. In my opinion, it accounts for the important, and still  unexplained, fact of the accumulation of molecules [atoms] of carbon in  organic compounds. In compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc., molecules [atoms]  of carbon are linked together...\" .   Couper's paper also differed from Kekule's in another important way: it  was illustrated with graphic formulas of molecules, with bonds between atoms  explicitly shown by a series of dotted lines. In the more extensive follow-up   41  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 3. Archibald Scott Couper (1831-1892)   paper with the same title published later the same year (35), Couper replaced  the dotted lines with dashes to give structural formulas that clearly presage the  modern versions, as shown in Figure 4 for methanol, ethanol, and cyanuric acid.   The last of these three examples is important, since it shows an explicit  representation of a cyclic compound almost a decade before Kekule proposed his  cyclic formula for benzene. This last formula is also important in showing that  Couper did not explicitly represent double bonds between atoms in his structures.   It may also have been unfortunate for Couper that he was an excellent  experimentalist, because his greater skill in the laboratory unwittingly gave  ammunition to his opponents. In his early work that culminated in structural  theory, he reported the formation of a cyclic compound from the reaction between  phosphorus pentachloride and salicylic acid (31). Both Kekule (36) and Kolbe  (37) attempted to reproduce his reaction without success, and used their failure  to duplicate his results to cast doubt on his other claims. It was not until a better  experimentalist, Richard Anschiltz, repeated Couper's work exactly as he had  set out in his paper that his skill as an experimentalist was confirmed, and his   42  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nreputation was restored (38). Kekule and Kolbe had both continued heating the  reaction beyond the time specified by Couper, and therefore obtained the acid  chloride. Couper's skill was again verified by Pinkus and his coworkers in the  1960s (39). When looked at in the light of his career - he was a young man of  27 years with only two to three years of formal training in chemistry - Couper's  papers are remarkable, and one can only wonder what he might have produced  had that career not been cut short.   Refinement of the Theory of Chemical Structure: 1859-1870   Following the publication of structural theory for all to examine, the next  major players in its development were the Russian, Aleksandr Mikhailovich  Butlerov (1828-1886), the Scot, Alexander Crum Brown (1838-1922), and the  Austrian, Johann Josef Loschmidt (1821-1895).   Aleksandr Mikhailovich Butlerov (Butlerow, Boutlerov)  Immediately upon its publication, Couper's work came under fire. The first   to attack his theory was Kekule, who summarily claimed priority for the ideas  contained therein in a paper entitled, \"Remarques par M. A. Kekule a 1'occasion  d'une Note de M. Couper sur une nouvelle theorie chimique\" (40) - even though  he may have misunderstood (41) part of Couper's formulas and symbolism.  Wurtz, too, found fault with Couper's paper, calling his structural formulas \"too  arbitrary and too far removed from experiment\" (42); he found fault with his use  of language, which he considered intemperate, his use of the atomic weight of  8 for oxygen, and his summary dismissal of the established theories of organic  chemistry. As a consequence of this (and it is tempting to speculate that it was also  a result of his rancorous parting with Couper), Wurtz did not advance Couper's  claims as a co-creator of structural theory (43) in favor of Kekule's claims,  although he did eventually acknowledge Couper as an independent co-inventor of  structural theory in a footnote in his history of chemical theories (44). The other  major criticism of Couper's paper came from Butlerov (45), who considered  Couper's ideas premature and not supported by the available evidence. As we  shall see below, Butlerov's opinion changed with time.   Butlerov, whose portrait is shown in Figure 5, is a figure whose place in  the development of structural theory has been clouded by politics (46). Born  to a family in the lesser nobility, Butlerov was educated at Kazan' University,  where he studied under Nikolai Nikolaevich Zinin (whose discoveries include the  reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline) and Karl Karlovich Klaus (the discoverer  of ruthenium). Although his thesis for kandidat (approximately a modern Ph.D.)  was on the butterflies of the Volga-Ural region (47), Zinin's departure for St.  Petersburg left the University needing a junior colleague for Klaus to teach  chemistry, so Butlerov was appointed to the post. Following Klaus' departure  for Dorpat (now Tartu, in Estonia), the sole responsibility for teaching chemistry  at Kazan' University devolved upon Butlerov. During a komandirovka (study  leave) in western Europe, he became acquainted with both Kekule and Couper,   43  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nwood  alcohol   alcohol   C2  O-OH|  H3 f   C2  O-OH  H3   C2 H3   HOâOâAzâCâAzOâOH  1 i 1   ^Az< cyanuric acid   C   [câOH   OH  H t H   H^,OH   H t H   H O ^ N ^ O H   OH   Couper 1858 modern representation  (full structural formulas)   Figure 4. Structural formulas from Coupers second paper in 1858, and the  modern versions of the same formulas. Note that Coupers structure for cyanuric   acid is not correct, having the oxygen atoms bonded to nitrogen.   and he quickly became a disciple of the new ideas being promulgated among  the chemists of the younger generation. On his return to Russia, he continued  to develop his version of the theory, and he wrote the first textbook of organic  chemistry based exclusively on structural theory (48). Butlerov was an inspiring  teacher who was trusted and admired by students and faculty alike: he served two  terms as Rector of Kazan' University (the second at the insistence of the students)  before moving to St. Petersburg, where he spent the remainder of his career.   During the Soviet era, Butlerov was vigorously championed by Russian  historians of science and some in the west as the true creator of structural theory  (49). Unfortunately, this effort to give Butlerov priority in creating the theory  meant that his real, and critically important, contributions in developing the  theory were largely overlooked. An interesting analogy can be found in the Wittig  reaction: Although the reaction between a phosphorane and a carbonyl compound  had been discovered by Hermann Staudinger (50) in 1919, it was the work of  Georg Wittig over three decades later (51) that led to it becoming a truly useful  synthetic method. Likewise, although Couper and Kekule had created structural  theory, it was Butlerov who best understood the true potential of their theory, and  who made their creation useful.   Butlerov was the first to use the explicit term, \"chemical structure,\" and he  presented structural theory in a much more useful form than either Kekule's or  Couper's papers (52), showing organic chemists how to get the maximum benefit  from its application. It was Butlerov's explicit statement that each compound  is represented by a single chemical structure, and that each chemical structure  represents a single compound, that was the defining statement of his version of the  theory. This went further than either Couper or Kekule had done, and encouraged  the use of structural theory in predicting, for example, the number and structures  of isomers of organic compounds. Over the next several years, Butlerov did just  that (53); in 1876, he used structural theory to provide the first explanation of the  phenomenon that later became known as tautomerism (54). More importantly, he  verified his structural predictions with validating syntheses of compounds such as  /er/-butyl alcohol (55) and isobutylene (56). Moving structural theory from an  organizing tool to a predictive tool was critical to its wider acceptance.   44  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 5. Aleksandr Mikhailovich Butlerov (1828-1886)   Butlerov's Version of Structural Theory Expounded: The Speyer Paper   Butlerov presented his first paper on structural theory, \"Einiges iiber die  chemische Struktur des Korpers,\" to the Chemistry Section at the Congress of  German Naturalists and Physicians at Speyer in 1861 (52). In it, he stated, \"The  well known rule that says that the nature of compound molecules depends on the  nature, the quantity, and the arrangement of its elementary constituents can for  the present be changed as follows: the chemical nature of a compound molecule  depends on the nature and quantity of its elementary constituents and on its  chemical structure.\" Although Butlerov had criticized Couper's structures in 1859,  at the end of his Speyer lecture in 1861 he made the following telling comment:  \"I am even obliged to remark that the theory and formulas of Couperâwhose  too absolute and exclusive conclusions I disputed at that timeâcontained similar  thinking. It was, however, neither clearly enough perceived nor expressed.\"   Emil Erlenmeyer (1825-1909), the editor of the Zeitschrift fur Chemie,  understood Butlerov's models better than most of his contemporaries, and  published the paper in his journal. To him is due much of the credit for the rise  of popularity of Butlerov's ideas.   The formulas in Butlerov's paper, like those of Couper, showed bonds  between groups of atoms, but did not show every bond in a molecule explicitly;  his formulas retained some vestiges of Type formulas, and tend to resemble  modern condensed structural formulas. Butlerov was, however, fully committed  to the new structural theory, although he did recognize that for some compounds  it was not necessary to specify every bond explicitly.   45  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nAlexander Crum Brown   The move towards the explicit designation of every bond in a molecule, and  modern graphical formulas, was the result of the work of Alexander Cram Brown  (shown in Figure 6), professor of chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. Cram  Brown was born and raised in Edinburgh, taking his M.D. from the University  of Edinburgh in 1861, and his D.Sc. from the University of London (the first  D.Sc. degree conferred by the University) in 1862. He spent the year following  his graduation from London in Germany, working with Bunsen and Kolbe, and  he then returned to Edinburgh to a junior faculty position in 1863. He succeeded  Lyon (later Lord) Playfair to the Chair of Organic Chemistry in 1869, being  chosen in preference to other candidates such as William Henry Perkin, Sr, of  mauve fame. Interestingly, one of his letters of support was written by Butlerov.  Crum Brown's intellect was powerful and wide-ranging, and his work was of  high caliber, but due to his propensity for publishing his work predominantly  in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the corresponding  Proceedings, much of his work was not well known by the chemistry community  at large: it was neither widely disseminated nor widely read. His interests ranged  from chemistry and mathematics (most of his contributions to organic chemistry  were theoretical and mathematical in content) to physiology, philosophy and  church history. While he is reported (57) to have had a knowledge of several  languages, including Russian and Chinese, and to have served as Examiner in  Japanese, his command of Russian may not have been to the level of fluency, since  his correspondence with Butlerov was in French, and not Russian. Nevertheless,  he was reputed by his contemporaries to be capable of \"filling any Chair in the  University.\"   In his M.D. thesis, presented in 1861, Cram Brown drew structures of  molecules that are remarkably like the modern formulas (58), with the exception  that he drew the symbol of each element inside a circle (reminiscent of Dalton's  symbolism), and he drew double bonds with bent lines, rather than straight  lines, as shown in Figure 7, for succinic acid. He followed this work up with a  paper entitled, \"On the classification of chemical substances by means of generic  radicals\" (59).   The obvious resemblance between Cram Brown's formulas and those of  Couper, whose brief time at Edinburgh after his return from France overlapped  with Cram Brown's student days, raises the equally obvious question of whether  or not Cram Brown was acquainted with Couper's formalism for writing chemical  structures. His biographer in the Journal of the Chemical Society maintains  (60) that although both men were in Playfair's laboratory in 1858 (Couper had  returned to Edinburgh in late autumn, 1858, and was offered the position in  Playfair's laboratory that December) Crum Brown was not, in fact, acquainted  with Couper's work.   Two letters from Frankland are quoted in Cram Brown's obituary (60), and  provide some insights into the reception of his graphical representations. On  May 28, 1866, Frankland wrote, \"I am much interested in graphic formulae  and consider that yours have several important advantages over Kekule's. In  my lectures here last autumn I used them throughout the entire course and with   46  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 6. Alexander Crum Brown (1838-1922)   Figure 7. Crum Brown s structural formula for succinic acid.  very great advantage, and I now have in the press a little book of Lecture Notes  for Chemical Students in which they are copiously used.\" In the second letter,  written on June 4, 1866, Frankland notes, \"I am just now endeavouring to get  Kolbe to express certain of his fundamental formulae graphically. We should  then understand each other better. There is a good deal of opposition to your  formulae here, but I am convinced that they are destined to introduce much more  precision into our notions of chemical compounds. The water-type, after doing  good service, is quite worn out.\" Prophetic words, indeed!   Johann Josef Loschmidt  The third innovator of the early 1860s was the Austrian physicist Johann Josef   Loschmidt, who, despite his work in chemistry, is not widely appreciated as a  chemist. A portrait of him is shown in Figure 8. Loschmidt was born in Pocena and  began his university education at the German University of Prague. He completed  his education at Vienna, but was unable to procure a teaching position there. He   47  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nmoved into industry, but became involved in a series of financially unsuccessful  (although technically sound) ventures; he eventually became a concierge at the  University of Vienna before qualifying as a high school teacher. He later became  Privatdozent at Vienna, and ended his career there as Professor of Physics - in the  same university where he had been concierge!   Loschmidt is remembered as a physicist for his determination of the  Loschmidt number (61), the number of molecules in 1 mL of gas, but in 1861  he published a small booklet (62) in which he drew structural formulas for a  large number of organic compounds. Two formulas of the Loschmidt type are  reproduced in Figure 9. It is interesting to note that, in many ways, Loschmidt's  formulae reflect Dalton's elemental symbols, and may, in fact, be based on  Dalton's symbolism.   It has been argued (63) that this pamphlet contains the first correct structure for  benzene, but this is an over-interpretation of Loschmidt's structures forbenzenoid  aromatic compounds. In his formulas, he represented most elements by circles  whose radii were proportional to their atomic weights (where the atomic weights  were close, he differentiated the atoms by the number of concentric circles - carbon  was a single circle, oxygen was a double circle, and nitrogen was a triple circle,  as shown in Figure 9). In like manner, he represented the hexavalent Ce unit of  the benzene nucleus by a large circle with an atomic weight of 78, and he then  distributed the other groups around this large circle. Where the available evidence  suggested that the groups were adjacent to each other, he placed them in adjacent  positions on the Ce ring. What is not arguable about Loschmidt's formulas is  his unequivocal and explicit representation of double and triple bonds between  elements, as shown in Figure 9 for two aromatic compounds.   Years before Kekule's benzene formula was published, Loschmidt represented  what translates into the Kekule structure of the aromatic ring of 1,3,5-triazine, and  this may be what has led to the assertion that he obtained the structural formula for  benzenoid aromatic compounds before Kekule. The fact that he did not explicitly  represent the six atoms of the benzenoid aromatic ring with alternating double and  single bonds as he did for the triazine ring suggests that this is not, in fact the case.  Regardless of this, it is unfortunate for Loschmidt that his system was cumbersome  to use, so it found little favor with practicing chemists.   Chemical Structure Becomes Physical Structure (1874)  The gradual adoption of structural theory occurred with remarkably little   resistance, although conservative chemists took more time to come to the more  modern theoretical view. Hermann Kolbe, for example, held to his theory of  \"rational constitution,\" although by the end of the 1860s, the differences between  Kolbe's view and structural theory had largely disappeared (64).   This acceptance brought with it the inevitable questions about whether the  distinction between the chemical structure of a molecule and its physical structure  was real. By the end of the 1860s, most of the vehement denials that the graphical  formula of an organic compound held any physical significanceâwhich had been  so important a part of the early papers on structural theoryâhad become muted.   48  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 8.

The start of the movement towards physical meaning for graphic formulas of  organic compounds may be traced to Louis Pasteur (shown in Figure 10), whose  work with the tartaric acids led to the proposal, presented in two lectures presented  before the Societe Chimique de Paris on January 20 and February 3,1860 (65), that  molecules of the same substance with opposite rotations might be related to each  other as object to mirror image. The importance of configuration at the molecular  level was reinforced by the work of Johannes Wislicenus (shown in Figure 10)  (66), who suggested that the differing properties of stereoisomers could be traced  to differing three-dimensional arrangements of their atoms.   49  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 10. Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) Johannes Wislicenus (1835-1902)   Figure 11. Jacobus Henricus van \\ Hoff (1852-1911) Joseph Achille Le Bel  (1874-1930)   The introduction of the tetrahedron into discussions of carbon compounds  occurred in 1862, but when Butlerov suggested that year, that an asymmetric  tetrahedral model with the individual affinities on the faces could be used to  explain why different valences of carbon had different strengths, and rationalize  the (spurious) difference between hydride of ethyl (C2H5âH) and ethane  (CH3âCH3) (67), it was as a heuristic aid, and not to imply the physical structure  of the molecule. In 1867, Kekule used tetrahedral models of the carbon atom to  rationalize the bonding in acetylene and hydrogen cyanide (68); a copy of the  Butlerov paper carrying Kekule's annotations has been discovered (69). Still,  there is no evidence that models were intended to serve as anything but useful  pedagogical devices; they were not intended to represent the actual physical  shape of carbon atoms in organic molecules. That step came six years later.   50  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nBy 1874, the Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff (1852-1911) and the  French chemist Joseph Achille Le Bel (1847-1930), working independently, had  simultaneously arrived at basically the same conclusion - that the formulas written  for organic compounds should be interpreted as having a physical significance  as well as a chemical significance (i.e atoms that had been interpreted as being  chemically close to each other were also physically close to each other). Figure  11 shows van't Hoff and Le Bel. This advance in structural theory appeared in  the form of a small pamphlet published in Dutch by van't Hoff (70), and a paper  by Le Bel, \"Sur les relations qui existent entre les formules atomiques des corps  organiques, et le pouvoir rotatoire de leurs dissolutions,\" published in the Bulletin  de la Societe Chimique de France (71). It is possible that van't Hoff, who was  working with Kekule at the time, may have been exposed to the idea of a non- planar carbon at the time of Kekule's 1867 paper. This does not, however, imply  that van't Hoff's tetrahedral carbon theory is not all of his own development: the  seed may have come from his time with Kekule, but the theory that emerged is  van't Hoff's.   This time, there were no polemics and no fight over priority (neither of the  principals had Kekule's driving ambition to be the first and only inventor of  the theory) - in fact, in his subsequent papers on stereochemistry, van't Hoff  was careful to point out Le Bel's contributions, and may have saved them from  obscurity. In both 1874 papers, the authors asserted that the physical properties  of organic compounds, especially their optical activity, could be accounted for  by specifying that the molecules contained an asymmetric atom corresponding  to a tetrahedron surrounded by four different groups. While van't Hoff's paper  concentrated on the tetrahedron as the basis for optical activity, Le Bel's paper  was more wide-ranging, and allowed other chiral shapes to be considered.   There is a question of just how rapidly the concepts in van't Hoff's and Le  Bel's papers would have been adoptedby the organic chemistry community at large  had not Johannes Wislicenus championed them. Wislicenus wrote the preface to  the German translation of van't Hoff's booklet, which he had asked his student,  F. Hermann, to translate into German. There is no doubt that having someone of  Wislicenus' status as a champion helped the tetrahedral carbon gain acceptance,  but one must also give Kolbe some credit. The dissemination of these ideas was  almost certainly also helped by his (unfortunately for his legacy) intemperate, even  legendary, tirade (72) against the tetrahedral carbon in van't Hoff's paper, since it  gave them a wider readership than they might otherwise have enjoyed.   Conclusion   By the end of the 1860s, graphical formulas for organic compounds were so  widely accepted that their use had become routine, although their translation to  representations of the physical positions of the atoms took another half decade.  The upshot of this rapid acceptance was that the progenitors of the theory, who  had fought so furiously over priority claims, were not really given the full credit  for their discoveriesâwhen a theory becomes so \"obvious\" to all practitioners of  a science, its novelty is forgotten, and few remember the hard work of, or feel   51  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nit necessary to recognize, the pioneers. Even so, the controversy over priority  for the development of modern graphical formulas and the structural theory of  organic chemistry did not end with the nineteenth century. In 1923, Sir James  Walker stated, in his Presidential Address to the Chemical Society of London, that  the use of graphical formulas in organic chemistry could be traced from Couper  through Cram Brown to Wurtz, and not through Kekule and Loschmidt (73), and  we have already discussed the efforts of Soviet historians of science to assign credit  for the theory to Butlerov. It is an interesting footnote to history that in 1868,  the year after Kekule had left Ghent for Bonn, his former colleague, Carl Glaser,  immediately adopted Erlenmeyer's structural formulas (74), which Erlenmeyer  had, in turn, adapted from those of Cram Brown (75) âjust ten years after Couper  had formulated his structural theory, his structural formulas displaced Kekule's in  Kekule's own former department, surely one of the ultimate ironies of the whole  story.   It is remarkable that, in the space of less than two decades, the structural  theory of organic chemistry should have moved from the first hesitant steps,  where the chemical structure was considered to be separate and distinct from the  physical structure of the molecule, and represented only the \"affinities\" of the  atoms within the molecule, to the point where those same formulas were now  viewed as representations of the actual physical locations of the atoms in the  molecule (76). What was left undone at the end of the nineteenth century, by  which time three-dimensional graphical formulas for organic compounds were in  routine use, was, of course, a description of exactly what the \"chemical affinities\"  of the atoms composing the molecules were. The answer to this problem would  have to await the new century, and the development of modern theories of the  atom and bonding.   References   1. Kekule, A.Ann. Chem. Pharm. 1858, 106, 129-159.  2.

Brock*   Department of History, University of Leicester, Leicester LEI 7RH, UK  * william.b rock@btinternet.com   Triggered by Benjamin Collins Brodie's extraordinary  \"Calculus of Chemical Operations\" in 1866, the following  decade witnessed a number of highly-charged debates about  whether chemists should believe in the atomic-molecular  theory. Although largely resolved by the complexity of Brodie's  system and by its failure to explain stereochemistry, debate  was renewed by Ostwald's development of energetics in the  1890s. If energy, not matter, was primary, what need of atoms  and molecules when chemical phenomena were sufficiently  explained and predicted by energy exchanges? Many chemists,  like Ramsay, were nearly persuaded until, in 1906, Perrin  rendered scepticism of interest only to historians.   Despite some early signs that not every chemist was happy with Dalton's  atomic theory at a philosophical level, the majority of chemical practitioners  during the first half of the nineteenth century were content to accept atomism at  a conventional level. In the 1960s, David Knight and I called this the \"textbook  approach\" (1, 2). Subsequently, in his important book on chemical atomism,  Alan Rocke clarified the distinction between physical atomism and the textbook  tradition of chemical atomism, and showed that even when chemists like William  Hyde Wollaston asserted that equivalents were more experimentally-based and  less hypothetical than atomic weights, a corpuscular philosophy or, at the very  least, an idea of a unique invariant of chemically-indivisible units, lay behind their  chemical practice (3). Chemists were content to be agnostic and indifferent to the  question as to whether physical atoms really existed and agnostic and indifferent  to whether (if they did) they were the same as their chemical atoms.   Â© 2010 American Chemical Society  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nChemical atomism was relatively uncontroversial, even though it was itself  a hypothetical construct based upon assumptions concerning stoichiometric  units that might vary between individual chemists. But physical atomism was  controversial, and if anyone attacked physical atomism, it was bound sometimes  to impugn the legitimacy of the chemical atom, despite the latter's usefulness as  an analytical stoichiometric category.   That is what happened in 1866 when the complacent conventionalism of  British chemists was shattered when the Professor of Chemistry at Oxford, Sir  Benjamin Collins Brodie (1817-80), strongly argued that chemistry had gone  off the rails; chemists were disobeying Lavoisier's fundamental premise of the  Chemical Revolution; namely, that chemistry had to be based upon facts, that  is, experimental evidence, not on speculation (4). Since there was no physical  evidence for the existence of atoms, the idea of an atomic weight was an  absurdity; it was misleading and spurious. The atomic theory, Brodie observed,  had recently led to the absurdity of atomic model kits, a phantasmagoria of  multi-coloured billiard balls on sticks. Chemistry students were being dangerously  misled. Chemistry had to be based upon observable, experimental data such as  Gay-Lussac's law of gaseous volumes and Dulong and Petit's rule concerning  specific heats. Chemistry also needed to become more mathematical and, ideally,  an axiomatic deductive system. And with that declaration to the Royal Society  in 1866, he launched a new and very strange system he called \"The Calculus of  Chemical Operations\" which employed Greek symbols for chemical events (that  is, operations or reactions), rather than Jacob Berzelius's symbols for chemical  elements or atoms. See Table 1.   The maths involved, a form of Boolian algebra, was beyond the ken of most  contemporary chemists, with the notable exception of Alexander Williamson who  had studied higher mathematics with Auguste Comte in Paris. Consequently, after  publishing the first part of his system in 1866 in the Philosophical Transactions  of the Royal Society, the Chemical Society (whose President, William Allen  Miller, was succeeded by Williamson that year) asked Brodie to give a simple  explanatory lecture. This exposition entitled \"Ideal Chemistry\" received massive  publicity in William Crookes's Chemical News and John Cargill Brough's rival  weekly, The Laboratory (5). But it is doubtful that Brodie's audience came  away much the wiser, having been daunted by a plethora of Greek symbols and  Brodie's use of a glass cube which he defined as a 1000-ccs of empty space at  NTP. (Despite his attack on molecular models, Brodie was equally dependent  upon a visual aid!) What did strike a chord, however, was that Brodie's symbolic  system appeared to classify the known chemical elements into three classes: those  with a single symbol like hydrogen, a and carbon, K; those with two identical  symbols which Brodie represented algebraically as squared, such as oxygen,  ^  2; and most excitingly, those with a double symbol such as chlorine, ax2. The  latter group was exciting since the elements involved were formally analogous to  compounds such as hydrogen peroxide, o^2. Had Brodie uncovered evidence that  elements such as chlorine contained hydrogen? His work on organic peroxides  in 1864 had already made him suspect chlorine was not an element (6). Had old  William Prout, dismissed experimentally by Jean-Baptiste Stas only a few years  before, been right all along? Were the elements compounds of hydrogen? (7)   60  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nSince this was the period when chemists like William Allen Miller and Edward  Frankland were cooperating with astronomers like William Huggins and Norman  Lockyer on spectroscopic surveys of the sun and stars, it was easy to speculate (as  Brodie himself did) that some of his symbols that carried no earthly elementary  meaning, such as %, might represent elementary materials present in the sun,  where dissociation constantly occurred.   Poor Brodie. His well-meaning attempt to place chemistry on surer empirical  and mathematical foundations went off at a tangent concerning the possibility that  elements were really complex. That is not to say that his anti-physical atomism  stance was totally ignored. Far from it. The matter was hotly debated at the  Chemical Society in 1867 and in the chemical press for some 18 months with  Williamson pressing the case for the acceptance of physical atoms that bore a  direct relationship with the chemical atoms defined by Stanislao Cannizzaro's  and August Wilhelm Hofmann's revival of Amedeo Avogadro's approach and  which bore some sort of relation to the particles of physicists' kinetic theories.  As Alan Rocke notes in his essay in this book, and Williamson made explicit  in 1869, physical and chemical atomism was supported by a consilience of  inductions, namely stoichiometric laws, Cannizzaro's molecular theory and the  doctrine of valence. To this evidence must be added the contemporary physicists'  kinetic theory of gases as consisting of hard particles. We must remember, too,  that while organic chemistry dominated the research headlines in the 1860s and  1870s, the determination of atomic weight values for each and every element  remained a perennial theme of inorganic research activity. Moreover, following  the Karlesruhe Conference, relative atomic weights became an international  collaborative enterprise involving heated discussions over the choice of H = 1 or  O = 16 as the standard. Brodie was totally ignored by this movement.   As August Kekule and others observed, too, the Calculus was based on  initial assumptions that, if altered, produced different results; whereas, chemical  atomism, as practised, was serving chemists well and forming a self-consistent  system. What was the justification for choosing integral values for the indices  of Brodie's prime factors, Kekule and others wanted to know, unless it was an  atomic one? Brodie's justification appealed to Gay-Lussac's law, though even  rigorous experimentation had not produced whole numbers. In fact, as Duncan  Dallas has shown, if non-integral values had been used, negative weights would  have appeared (8).   Kekule's other sensible point was that we do not necessarily choose the  simplest hypothesis in science unless the consequences are also simple; and  Brodie's consequences were not simple because they produced compounded  elements. George Carey Foster, a chemist turned physicist, also noted how our  very notion of a \"compound\" involves a mental division into separate entities  so that, unless one appealed to transmutation, the notion of invariable least bits  was an inevitable consequence of chemical composition. Ursula Klein has shown  how important Berzelius's system of chemical signs was for the development of  organic chemistry; by the same token, Brodie's system of signs would have been  inhibiting and less conducive to understanding what was happening in chemical  reactions and in reaching a model for teaching purposes (9). As Charles Alder  Wright pointed out during a debate in 1872, Berzelian symbols could still be used   61  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nwithout a commitment to physical atomism. In the striking words of a German  historian, Britta Gors, \"chemists learned chemistry with the help of the atomic  concept, without however having to take the atom's existence into account\" (10).  Ironically, even an arch anti-atomist like Wilhelm Ostwald recognised this in his  own influential textbooks.   Brodie's attempt to abolish the chemical atom, and thereby the physical  atom, would not work. Nevertheless, Brodie persisted with his Calculus trying  to incorporate carbon compounds into the system, but failing to find a simple  way of distinguishing between ordinary isomers (which have identical weights  and therefore identical symbols), let alone stereochemical ones. He died in 1880 having failed to persuade chemists that his anti-atomistic stance was a sensible  way forward now that organic chemists were able to picture molecular structures  using atomic symbolism.   Table 1. Brodie's Calculus of Chemical Operations (1866)  From Boole; x + y = xy   If a compound weight of 9 units (water) is  operations for preparing them are x andy ,  weight whose operation is (x + y).  Let cp be the symbol for a unit of water; cp  a unit of oxygen.\nDuring the decade after Brodie's death, physical chemistry took off and  offered an alternative route to the mathematization of chemistry. In the hands  of Wilhelm Ostwald, it seemed that energy, and the study of thermodynamics  generally, offered a solution to the cause of chemical reactivity in a way that  simple atomic-molecular theory never had or did. Ostwald was much influenced  by a worldwide sense of weariness with materialism, and a renewal of idealism,  that gripped European intelligentsia in the 1890s. A group of physicists, among  them Ernst Mach, John Bernhard Stallo and Pierre Duhem began to voice doubts  about physical atomism because the kinetic theory did not dovetail with accurate  experimentation. (For reasons of space, I ignore Marcellin Berthelot's important  role in down-playing atomism in French public education (11).) The consilience  between chemistry and physics had broken down. Mach, in particular, believed  science to be a construct of the human mind and that it was not possible to find  independent evidence for the existence of matter. Influenced by the thoughts  of Georg Helm in 1887, Ostwald began to deny atomism explicitly. He opted  instead for energetics - the laws of thermodynamics - rather than mechanical  explanations in chemistry. He argued that energy was more fundamental than  matter, which he saw only as another manifestation of energy. It followed that  chemical events were best analyzed as a series of energy transactions. The  difference between one substance and another, including one element and another,  was due to their specific energies (12).   The claim that energy could and should replace matter and mechanical  theories such as the kinetic theory, was debated heatedly at Ltibeck in 1895  during a meeting of the Versammlung Deutsche Naturforscher und Artze where  Ostwald's arguments were supported by Helm and by the Czech, Frantisek Wald,  who argued that the phase rule was more observationally sound than atomism.  Their opponents, Johannes Wislicenus and Victor Meyer for the chemists, and  Ludwig Boltzmann, Max Planck, Walther Nernst and others for the physicists,  ridiculed Ostwald's contention. Even Mach, who was no believer in atoms,  rejected energetics as an alternative.   European chemists were certainly fully aware of this controversy, as private  correspondence and journal articles show. However, the majority of chemists,  who were chiefly pursuing organic research, where the atom-molecular theory  had proved so helpful, ignored the debate. They were surely right to do so. After  all, energetics failed to offer any satisfactory explanation for the periodic law,  valence, structural theory in organic chemistry, or the so-called relative atomic  weights. Despite this indifference, Ostwald persisted, giving a cogent defence of  energetics in the Faraday Lecture he gave to the London Chemical Society in 1904  in the lecture theatre of the Royal Institution. There he argued that stoichiometric  laws were all deducible from thermodynamics, hence an \"atomic hypothesis was  unnecessary\" (13). There are similarities here with the claim that Wollaston's  equivalents were independent of a corpuscular hypothesis. By 1904, of course,  Ostwald was well aware of radioactivity and radioactive disintegrations. Indeed,  in view of such transformations he suggested that elementary transmutations  were possible in theory if energy barriers could be breached since elements were  merely \"hylotropes\" in which co-existing energy phases persisted in reactions.  But weren't these just chemical atoms in a different disguise? Ostwald may have   63  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nwished to deny atoms on philosophical grounds, but as a practising chemist he  utilised chemical atoms. It was, after all, Ostwald who standardised the mole  and who argued for O = 16 as the standard for the comparison of relative atomic  weights.   William Ramsay was a close personal friend of Ostwald's and he was  certainly one of the few British chemists impressed by the lecture. Perhaps this  was one of the reasons he began to dabble in spurious claims for transmutation  during the next few years - an extraordinary episode recently anayzed by  Morrisson (14). The majority of chemists ignored Ostwald as they had ignored  Brodie forty years earlier. As with the failure of Brodie's calculus of operations in  the 1870s, energetics and the phase rule could not compete with the explanatory  power of atomism. The textbook tradition of chemical atoms sufficed. The final  irony was that when Jean Perrin used the new physical chemistry to indirectly  demonstrate the existence of atoms and molecules from Brownian motion, Ernest  Rutherford and Frederick Soddy were demonstrating the dissolution of the atom  into constituent parts. The physical atom was no longer atomic. Perrin's work  convinced Ostwald that atomism was a sound basis for chemical philosophy and  he humbly expressed his conviction in the Preface to the 4th edition of his Outline  of General Chemistry in 1909.

Giunta*   Department of Chemistry and Physics, Le Moyne College,  Syracuse, NY 13214   *giunta@lemoyne.edu   The atom as an ultimate and indivisible particle of matter was a  venerable and a viable scientific notion for many years before  and after Dalton For example, Newton's speculations about  matter in the Queries at the end of his Opticks included Particles  \"so very hard, as never to wear or break in pieces; no ordinary  Power being able to divide what God himself made one in the  first Creation\" (Newton, I. Opticks; London, 1704; Query 31).  This chapter describes ideas and scientific evidence from the  late 19* and early 20* centuries about the contrary notion, the  divisibility of atoms. It is about the notion that the \"ultimate\"  pieces of matter themselves have pieces. It focuses on the  electron and the nucleus, with a few words about the proton and  neutron as well; it does not treat constituent pieces of nucleons  and more exotic particles.   Speculations on Parts of Atoms  The indestructibility of the atom was not universally accepted by scientists   in the 19* centuryâeven by those who accepted the existence of atoms (2).  In chemistry, Prout's hypotheses that atomic weights were integer multiples of  the weight of hydrogen and, more relevant to this topic, that hydrogen was a  constituent of all other elements, emerged within a very few years of Dalton's  atomic theory. Prout's hypotheses refused to die despite repeatedly failing  experimental tests during the course of the 19* century. Perhaps it is more  accurate to say that Prout's second hypothesis refused to die despite his first  hypothesis repeatedly failing experimental tests (3). During the 19* century,   Â© 2010 American Chemical Society  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nas atomic weights were determined with ever more precision, it became clear  that the atomic weights of several elements did not lie within experimental error  of integral values. Chlorine was just the most common and most prominent  example. Whatever the atomic weight scale employedâhydrogen = 1, oxygen =  16, or any of the other scales proposed or used in those days before international  standardsâundeniable examples of non-integral values could be found. And yet  speculation that atoms were divisible into units of hydrogen atoms, or later halves  or quarters of hydrogen atoms, continued among chemists.   Some physicists also tried to look under the hood of atoms, formulating  structural models before any of the constituent particles of atoms had been  identified. In the 1860s and 1870s, several investigators pursued the notion  that oscillations of electrical particles produced the characteristic emissions of  light from atoms and molecules which we call spectra. James Clerk Maxwell  implicated vibrations of \"parts of the molecule\" as the cause of bright-line spectra  in incandescent gases. George Johnstone Stoney began pursuing this line of  inquiry in 1868 (4). In Stoney's model, as it developed over the next few decades,  the electrical particles, which he called electrons, were inseparable from atoms  and associated with chemical bonds. Thus, Stoney's atoms were still whole, but  they had moving parts.   In the 1870s, Wilhelm Weber proposed that the atoms of chemical elements  consisted of a massive, negatively charged nucleus and a lighter, positively charged  satellite. In 1894 Joseph Larmor presented a theory of the ether in which stable  arrangements of \"electrons\" constitute atoms. In Larmor's theory, electrons were  vortices in the ether, permanent and all alike, that were also universal constituents  of matter (5).   In 1892, Hendrik Lorentz proposed an electromagnetic theory in which  particles (which he called ions) were the source of electromagnetic fields. In  1895, Lorentz explicitly equated his theoretical ions with electrochemical ions.  In Lorentz's theory, these electrical charges within matter were the Hertzian  oscillators that produced emitted light. Pieter Zeeman carried out experiments  on the effect of magnetic fields on spectral lines in order to determine some  parameters in Lorentz's theory. In 1896 Zeeman estimated the value of the  charge-to-mass ratio of a Lorentzian \"ion\" that would be consistent with the line  splitting he observed. To obtain the observed magnitude of splitting of spectral  lines by magnetic fields, the charge-to-mass ratio of these entities had to be much  greater than that of electrochemical ionsâabout three orders of magnitude greater  than even the lightest electrochemical ions (5).   The Electron and the Atom   J. J. Thomson is generally credited with \"discovering\" the electron in 1897 by  characterizing cathode rays. Around the centennial of the paper and presentation  most commonly cited as the announcement of the discovery, many historians and  philosophers of science asked what the phrase \"discover the electron\" means.  After all, the electron has many properties, and it plays an important part in many  phenomena. Mass, charge, and spin are among its important properties. Carrier   66  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nof fundamental electrical charge and building block of atoms and molecules are  just two of its roles. Which of the cluster of concepts we now attach to the term  electron are defining? Is the attribution of its discovery to Thomson justified, and  if so, to 1897?   What Thomson told an audience at the Royal Institution on April 30, 1897,  is that cathode rays are charged particles (which he called corpuscles) that are  much lighter than ordinary atoms. In a determination involving measurement of  heat generated by cathode ray bombardment, he found a mass-to-charge ratio of  1.6xl0-7 g emu1 (nearly 3 times current value), and he mentioned the similarity  of this ratio to the value Zeeman had found for the \"ions\" of Lorentz. Thomson's  lecture included many demonstrations of cathode ray phenomena, including their  deflection by electric and magnetic fields. Thomson explicitly speculated that  atoms were composed of these corpuscles, and he invoked Prout by name (6).   Clearly, the charge-to-mass ratio is an important characteristic of the electron,  arguably its defining characteristic. Thomson was not the first to arrive at a value  of this quantity within an order of magnitude of the one accepted today. Might  one of those who preceded Thomson in its determination be more justifiably  called the discoverer of the electron? Zeeman, for instance? It can be argued that  Zeeman's experimental work was too distant from the actual charged particles,  whose existence and properties he inferred through Lorentz's theory.   The same cannot be said of Emil Wiechert, who told the Physical Economical  Society of Konigsberg on January 7, 1897, that cathode rays are moving particles  2000-4000 times lighter than a hydrogen atom. Wiechert based his statement  on experimental bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio obtained from magnetic  deflection of cathode rays. Wiechert is better known to the history of science as  a geophysicistâor at least he was before the centennial of the discovery of the  electron drew near. In fact, the entry on Wiechert in the Dictionary of Scientific  Biography (1976) makes no mention of his work on cathode rays. The scientific  achievements it discusses are limited to the geophysical school he founded at  Gottingen, whose faculty he joined in 1897. If Wiechert discovered the electron,  few took notice.   Walter Kaufmann also reported the determination of the charge-to-mass  ratio of cathode rays (about 107 emu g 1) in a paper he submitted in April 1897  (7). Kaufmann also based his result on magnetic deflection measurements;  however, he concluded that the hypothesis of cathode rays as emitted particles  could not explain his data. (One of the outstanding questions in the study of  cathode rays in the late 1890s was whether they were particles or electromagnetic  waves. Thomson and Kaufmann were typical of their countrymen: most British  researchers leaned toward the particulate hypothesis and most Germans toward  waves.) Today Kaufmann is better known for his careful measurements of the  velocity-dependent mass of the electron published over several years beginning  in 1901; these results were later explained by special relativity.   Thomson was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1906 \"in recognition  of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the  conduction of electricity by gases.\" The presentation speech, by J. P. Klason,  President of the Royal Swedish Academy, highlights his work in characterizing  electrons (8). (Klason called them electrons; Thomson, in his award lecture,   67  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nstill called them corpuscles.) Kaufmann's work was not similarly recognized;  however, he was recommended for the prize (along with Thomson) by Marie and  Pierre Curie (9).   In August 1897, Thomson submitted a paper to Philosophical Magazine  which included accounts of two independent methods of mass-to-charge  measurements, arriving at about 10 7 g emu1 (less than twice today's accepted  value) independent of the gas in the discharge tube or the metal of the cathode. This  paper included some speculation of how the corpuscles in atoms might arrange  themselves in concentric shells which somehow mimic chemical periodicity (10).  Thus, Thomson not only characterized cathode rays, a rather arcane and artificial  physical phenomenon; he placed those cathode-ray \"corpuscles\" into a much  more general and fundamental context as key entities in the structure of matter.   Isobel Falconer (11) and later Helge Kragh (12) have documented how  Thomson's thinking in the 1880s and 1890s prepared him to thrust the cathode-ray  corpuscles into the middle of a theory of matter. During most of that time,  Thomson was not interested in cathode rays, but in dynamical theories of  matter. As far back as 1882, Thomson mathematically worked out equilibrium  configurations of systems of vortices, which might somehow comprise atoms.  The notion that atoms might be vortices in the ether had first been proposed  by William Thomson (who was later to become Baron Kelvin) in 1867. J. J.  Thomson worked out stable arrangements of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 vortices. He also  described experiments Alfred Mayer had conducted with floating magnets as  a useful analog for larger numbers of vortices, whose mathematical treatment  would be messy if not intractable. In 1892, he pointed out analogies between  Mayer's magnets, arrangements of vortices, and chemical periodicity. In an 1896  lecture, he spoke of the likelihood that chemical elements were composed of  a primordial element, as Prout had suggested. Philipp Lenard's 1896 work on  cathode rays led Thomson to think that that prime matter was electrical, and it  was late in 1896 that he turned in earnest to characterizing those rays.   It has been suggested that Thomson deserves credit for discovering  the electron not in 1897 but in 1899. In that year, he reported not just the  mass-to-charge ratio, but the charge separately (and therefore the mass as well),  thereby providing convincing proof that the electron was much lighter than the  lightest known atom. He reported the charge of the corpuscle to be 6.8^1010  esu (about 1.4 times the value currently accepted) using the cloud chamber  technique developed by his student C. T. R. Wilson. In the same paper, he  identified photoelectric and thermoelectric particles as the same as his corpuscles.  And he proposed a model of the atom (essentially, a qualitative version of the  plum-pudding model) and a mechanism for ionization involving detachment of  corpuscles (13). By 1899, then, Thomson had accumulated considerable evidence  for what he had proposed in 1897, namely that corpuscles were much lighter than  even the lightest atom, and that they were much more widespread than cathode  ray tubes.   Clearly there is something arbitrary about defining the essence of discovery  and attributing it to a particular researcher at a particular time. In my mind, the  identity of the electron as a building block of ordinary matter is a key part of  the concept of the electron; simply characterizing cathode rays as particles of a   68  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\ncertain charge-to-mass ratio would have been a far more limited discovery (albeit  perhaps better defined). The question of timing is also somewhat arbitrary. Clearly  speculation is not the same as discovery; however, on the other hand, discovery  is not the same as proof beyond a shadow of a doubt. In my opinion, Thomson  had more than speculation about the role of corpuscles in 1897, although he had a  good deal more evidence by 1899.   Thomson's model of atomic structure was based on only one kind of  subatomic particle, the only one yet known, his \"corpuscles\" (our electrons).  Because the mass of the electron was known at least approximately, even the  simplest atoms had to have thousands of electrons. And because of the negative  charge of the electron, the space occupied by those electrons had to be positively  charged. Thomson's mathematically formidable 1904 paper (14) on his atomic  model tested the question of the possible stability of his atom against loss of  energy by electromagnetic radiation (an issue mentioned more frequently in  connection with the later Bohr model of the atom) (12). Within a couple of years,  though, Thomson concluded that the number of electrons in atoms was only the  order of magnitude of the gram atomic weight (15). By implication, then, the  atom had to have other pieces which accounted for most of its mass.   Radioactivity and Atomic Fragments   Radioactivity is the window through which the first glimpses of the more  massive pieces of the atom were obtained. Radioactivity proved to be a  remarkably fruitful field for science in very short order. Less than a decade  after Henri Becquerel's first reports of penetrating rays from uranium salts  (16), Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy concluded that radioactivity was  a subatomic phenomenon. A paragraph near the end of their landmark 1902  paper contains their conclusions: \"Since, therefore, radioactivity is at once  an atomic phenomenon and accompanied by chemical changes in which new  types of matter are produced, these changes must be occurring within the atom,  and the radioactive elements must be undergoing spontaneous transformation.  ... Radioactivity may therefore be considered as a manifestation of subatomic  chemical change (17)\"   The idea of one element changing into another was foreign to the chemistry  and physics of the time because of its association with discredited, pre-scientific  notions. Rutherford is supposed to have urged his colleague, \"Don't call it  transmutation. They'll have our heads off as alchemists (18).\" Whatever they  called it, they saw that atoms can change their identity. They also saw that these  changes could be used to shed further light on the inner workings of atoms. In this  same paper, they expressed the hope that radioactivity would serve as a tool for  \"obtaining information of the processes occurring within the chemical atom\" (17).   In 1902, Rutherford was a young globe-trotting academic. Born and  educated in New Zealand, he won a scholarship that brought him to J. J.  Thomson's laboratory in Cambridge. While there, he distinguished two kinds  of radiation from uranium characterized by their different powers of penetrating  matter. We still employ the unimaginative labels he used for convenience, a   69  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nand (3 (19). Rutherford moved to North America to take a faculty position at  McGill University in Montreal. There he discovered an isotope of radon, as  his radioactive emanation from thorium would come to be known (20), and he  worked out the time-dependence of radioactive emission, introducing the term  half-life (21). Soddy arrived in Montreal in 1900 to take the post of Demonstrator  of chemistry at McGill. Soddy, unlike Rutherford, was actually a chemist, having  earned first class honors in that subject at Oxford. Rutherford's only credential in  chemistry was the Nobel Prize he would receive in 1908.   Nature of the a Particle  Ever since Rutherford had distinguished a from (3 rays, he was engaged in   investigating the nature of a particles and their interactions with matter. Over  the course of about a decade, he came to the conclusion that a particles were  doubly-charged helium atoms. (We would say helium nuclei, but he did not know  about nucleiâyet.) The nature of the a particle was the subject of Rutherford's  Nobel lecture in 1908 (22). The last piece of evidence for the identity of the  a particle as a doubly-charged helium ion came from an experiment carried  out by Rutherford and his research student Thomas Royds. Before the elegant  experiment described in that paper, work by Rutherford, his associates, and  independent investigators had measured the charge-to-mass ratio of the a particle  and had noted the appearance of helium in the presence of a emitters at the  same rate as the emission of a particles. What Rutherford and Royds did was to  separate the collection of helium from the a-emitting source by something that  functioned as a semi-permeable membrane, penetrable by a particles but not by  ordinary gases (23).   Scattering a Particles and the Nucleus  Even before he finished characterizing a particles, Rutherford had begun   using them as a probe of the atom. The discovery of the nucleus consisted of the  realization that all of an atom's positive electrical charge and most of its mass are  confined to a volume that is only a tiny fraction of the atom's volume. Rutherford  published these conclusions in 1911 (24), and he reached them on the basis of  experiments involving the scattering of a particles. Discovery of the nucleus is  the main reason for Rutherford's inclusion in introductory chemistry textbooks.  Diagrams purporting to depict Rutherford's a-particle scattering experiments  often accompany the discussion of the discovery of the nucleus in introductory  chemistry texts. Such diagrams are conceptually clear but a bit misleading  historically; they depict not the experiments that led Rutherford to discover the  nucleus but experiments that confirmed the discovery.   In 1906, Rutherford published a paper titled \"Retardation of the a Particle  from Radium in passing through Matter (25).\" The apparatus is shown in Figure 1  as a schematic from the paper and as a line drawing from The Restless Atom (26).  a particles were made to pass through an evacuated brass tube through a slit to  be detected by a photographic plate. The slit could be covered by thin layers of   70  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nmatter such as aluminum foil or mica. Rutherford mentioned scattering of a rays  only briefly near the end of this paper, as a complicating factor in the retardation  studies.   He promised further experiments to clear up the matter, and Hans Geiger was  the man who carried them out in Rutherford's lab. (That lab was by now back  across the Atlantic, at the University of Manchester.) Figure 2 shows Geiger's  apparatus, which was physically different but conceptually similar to the earlier  one: a tube containing a source of a particles at one end, a screen with a slit toward  the middle, and a detector at the other end (27).   Photographic plates from Rutherford's 1906 paper appear in Figure 3. They  show the image made by the a particles from the radioactive wire as they passed  through the slit. The blurrier lower half of the photo on the right was produced  by a particles that also passed through a thin piece of mica, which covered the  lower half of the slit. Some of the rays were deflected by as much as 2Â° in the  course of passing through the 30-(jm thick mica, requiring, Rutherford estimated,  an average electric field of 100 million volts per cm, \"a deduction in harmony  with the electronic theory of matter.\" Geiger's 1908 results appear in Figure 4.  Curve A represents the distribution of scintillations when the a particles passed  through an evacuated tube. Curve B represents the distribution when one piece  of gold leaf covered the slit, and curve C two pieces. \"It will be noticed,\" Geiger  wrote, \"that some of the a-particles after passing through the very thin leaves were  deflected through quite an appreciable angle.\" Further experiments were promised,  and Geiger published an extensive account of the small-angle scattering in 1910  (28).

Geiger also looked into large-angle scattering in Rutherford's lab, working  now with Ernest Marsden. If a particles could be reflected from matter, the simple  apparatus depicted in Figure 5 would be certain to detect it. An a-particle source  was placed near a metal plate or foil, and a detector placed nearby so as to intercept  any reflected a-particles. A lead plate was placed to block any a-particles that  might otherwise pass directly from the source to the detector. Sure enough, they  found that metal plates were able to reflect rather than absorb some particles. But   73  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\neven a single piece of gold foil less than a micron thick could deflect some particles  through 90Â° (29). \"It was almost as incredible as if you fired a fifteen-inch shell  at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you,\" Rutherford recalled many  years later (30).   Rutherford's 1911 paper (24) was based mainly on these experimental  investigations of scattering. Titled \"The Scattering of a and (3 Particles by Matter  and the Structure of the Atom,\" it was a heavy-duty mathematical analysis of the  sort Rutherford was not known for. He developed the consequences of scattering  from a center carrying a charge of about 100 times the electron charge (positive  or negative) surrounded by a sphere containing an equal and opposite charge  spread uniformly throughout it. Of course the mathematical theory was amenable  to specific predictions, and Rutherford mentioned at the end of his paper that  Geiger and Marsden were already beginning to test the theory. The results  of those investigations were published in 1913 (31). Here we finally have an  apparatus like the one depicted in textbooks, capable of measuring a large range  of scattering angles (shown in Figure 6). It included a rotatable circular stage  on which a microscope and zinc sulfide detection screen were mounted. The a  source was largely surrounded by lead so as to direct emerging particles to the  scattering target.   Pieces of the Nucleus   Simplicity was never an attribute attached to the concept of nucleus in the way  that it was attached for many years to the concept of atom. By the time the nuclear  model of the atom was formulated, the atom was already known to be composite  and at least some atoms impermanent. If the nucleus contained most of the mass  of an atom, and if a radioactive atom spontaneously ejected pieces like a particles,  then the nucleus must be where those ejected particles came from. Of course, we  teach our students that nuclei are made of protons and neutrons. How did these  particles come to be known? Rutherford had a hand in their stories as well.   The Proton   In 1914, Rutherford noted \"It is well known from the experiments of J.J.  Thomson and others, that no positively charged carrier has been observed of mass  less than that of the hydrogen atom. The exceedingly small dimensions found  for the hydrogen nucleus [based on scattering of a particles by hydrogen] add  weight to the suggestion that the hydrogen nucleus is the positive electron...\" By  positive electron, Rutherford meant fundamental particle of positive electricity or  something similar. He went onto speculate, \"The helium nucleus has a mass nearly  four times that of hydrogen. If one supposes that the positive electron, i.e. the  hydrogen atom, is a unit of which all atoms are composed, it is to be anticipated that  the helium atom [that is, the helium nucleus] contains four positive electrons and  two negative (32).\" (The notion of negative electrons in the nucleus was natural.  After all, (3 particles had already been identified as electrons, and the emission of  (3 particles was different than ordinary ionization. It was radioactivity, a cluster   74  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nof phenomena with which the nucleus was associated as soon as the concept of  nucleus was introduced.)   BarriePeake (33) dates the discovery of the proton to 1913, when Rutherford  concluded that hydrogen has the \"simplest possible structure of a nucleus with  one unit charge (34)\" This paper of Rutherford's does not, however, contain the  notion of hydrogen nucleus as atomic building block, something that I consider  crucial to the concept of the proton. Indeed, one can say that the ionized hydrogen  atom was known long before 1913 in discharge tubes and (in solvated form) in  electrochemistry; however, there was no good reason to think then that ionized  hydrogen was a building block of atoms.   For years, these particles had no special name. Rutherford suggested two  names for the hydrogen nucleus at the 1920 British Association meeting in  Cardiff. Rutherford spoke on \"The Building up of Atoms,\" and he speculated on  the constitution of several composite bodies as combinations of hydrogen nuclei  and electrons. (One of the composite particles he did mention by name was the  yet \"unknown doublet neutron of mass 1 and charge 0\" composed of a hydrogen  nucleus and an electron \"in very close juxtaposition;\" more on that below.)  Oliver Lodge asked Rutherford for a term for the hydrogen nucleus so as to avoid  confusion with the hydrogen atom, and Rutherford offered two: \"prouton\" or  \"proton (35)\" The former term would honor William Prout. The later can be  derived from the Greek \"first\" or \"primary.\"   By this time, Rutherford had evidence that hydrogen nuclei could come from  more complex nuclei (36). In 1919, he reported an anomalous effect when he  subjected dry air to a particles: H atoms seemed to be produced even when there  was no hydrogen in the system! Rutherford correctly interpreted the presence of H  nuclei as a sign that the a particles caused some sort of transmutation, and that the  H nuclei were fragments of that reaction. I infer from Rutherford's use of the term  \"disintegration\" that he pictured the reaction as an induced fission of nitrogen.  In fact, the reaction was 14N + 4He â> 170 + lH. Rutherford and his associates  worked to bolster the conclusion of the proton as a fragment of a nuclear reaction  over the next five years or so by more rigorously excluding hydrogen impurities  and by finding proton fragments in collisions of a particles with a variety of light  elements (35).   The Neutron   Unlike the proton, which was observed long before it was named, the neutron  was named before it was observed. Rutherford's talk at the British Association  meeting in Cardiff in late summer 1920 seems to be the first usage of the term  neutron with a meaning similar to our understanding of the term. Rutherford  noted that the composite neutron, a \"close association\" of a hydrogen nucleus  and electron, would have interesting properties. Except at very short distances,  it would give rise to a negligible electric field, which would allow it to pass  easily through matter, and he doubted that it could be confined to a material  container. It could, however, have a place within the nucleus, kept there by the  immense electric field within the tiny space of the nucleus. A few weeks earlier,  in his Bakerian Lecture before the Royal Society, Rutherford (who by now had   75  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nsucceeded J. J. Thomson as the Cavendish Professor at Cambridge) described this  composite particle without naming it. He also announced his intent to search for  such a particle in electrical discharges of hydrogen, where hydrogen nuclei and  electrons would be present in a high-energy environment (37).   Several students and associates of Rutherford attempted to make and detect  neutrons by these means or via \"swift\" protons produced in nuclear reactions  induced by a particles: protons and electrons were given opportunities to smash  into each other. These efforts did not lead to the discovery of the neutron.   The key event that eventually did lead to its discovery was a report by Walther  Bothe and Herbert Becker at Giessen, in an experiment whose purpose had  nothing to do with neutrons. Bothe and several collaborators were investigating  transformations of various light nuclei when exposed to a particles. In 1930,  Bothe and Becker reported a very penetrating radiation from beryllium exposed  to a particles. The radiation was more penetrating than the most penetrating y  rays known, and the investigators thought that they were most likely y rays (38).   Irene and Frederic Joliot-Curie investigated this system further,  communicating three reports on the putative y rays in 1931 and early 1932.  Their report from January 1932 described the effect of interposing various  materials between the beryllium source of the rays and the ionization chamber  they used as a detector. Thin screens of several metals had little or no effect  on the emissions. But when hydrogen-containing materials were interposed,  the ionization current increased. The augmentation was most pronounced with  paraffin. The Joliot-Curies realized that the increased ionization was due to  protons coming from the screen: the radiation from the beryllium could knock  protons from paraffin and other hydrogen-containing materials (39).

The ability of the radiation from beryllium to dislodge protons suggested  to him that the radiation was in the form of a massive particle rather than a  quantum (or photon, as we would say). A particle with mass about equal to that of  a proton would make conservation of momentum work out easily in the observed  phenomena. Chadwick reproduced the Curie's observation with paraffin, and  he added experiments in which he allowed the radiation from beryllium to pass  through samples of other light elements. In these cases, he observed short-ranged  recoil atoms, again consistent with the beryllium radiation being a material  particle. The radiation would have to be electrically neutral, however, to explain  its extreme power of penetration. Within a month, Chadwick sent a letter to  Nature describing his experiments and proposing that they were best explained if  the radiation was a material particle carrying no charge and mass about equal to  that of a protonâthat is, a neutron (40). A more detailed paper followed three  months after that.   Chadwick was one of Rutherford's associates in looking for neutrons in the  1920s. He had been a student of Rutherford's at Manchester, receiving an M.Sc.  in 1913. He went to Berlin to work with Hans Geiger, who had worked with  Rutherford for many years at Manchester. As an English civilian in Germany,  Chadwick was interned during the Great War. He caught up again with Rutherford  at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1919, and Chadwick remained at Cambridge until  1935. That same year, he received the Nobel Prize in physics for discovery of the  neutron (41).   Is the neutron as we understand it today really a combination of a proton  and electron as Rutherford envisioned it? This is a philosophically interesting  question. When neutrons decay, they produce a proton and an electron (and an  antineutrino as well); however, these particles are not understood to have a real  existence \"within\" an intact neutron. Indeed, the constituent parts of neutrons (and  protons for that matter) are understood to be quarks. The phenomenon of neutron  decay is explained by a transformation of one of its constituent quarks, turning the  neutron into a proton; the energy difference between the neutron and proton gives  rise to the electron and antineutrino.   Conclusion   Most of the developments described in this chapter span a period from the  1890s to the early 1930s. At the beginning of that period, skepticism over the  very existence of atoms was still respectable among both chemists and physicists.  Among those who believed in physical existence of atoms, the default picture was  generally one of fundamental solidity and permanence (which is not to deny that  some scientists thought about possible constituent parts). By the end of the period,  scientists universally accepted both the reality of atoms and their complexity. Not  only did some atoms fall apart all by themselves, but human beings could break  off pieces. Atoms were no longer the ultimate pieces of matter. By the 1930s, not  only was it clear that these pieces had pieces: it was likely that at least some of the  pieces of pieces had pieces.   77  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nThus the transformation of the default picture of the fundamental structure  of matter underwent a thorough transformation during this timeâand we have  not even mentioned the quantum revolution during the latter portion of this same  time. The foundations of matter must have appeared none too solid to many of the  researchers of the period.   Let us close with a revealing bit of doggerel, illustrating how the concept of  the atom was changing before chemists' very eyes. The author is eminent British  chemist William Ramsay, best known for his role in the discovery and isolation of  most of the noble gas elements, for which he was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize  in Chemistry. He wrote these verses for his 1902 lab dinner.   The Death Knell of the Atom   Old time is a-flying; the atoms are dying;  Come, list to their parting oration:- \"We'll soon disappear to a heavenly sphere  \"On account of our disintegration,   \"Our action's spontaneous in atoms uranious  \"Or radious, actinious, or thorious;  \"While for others the gleam of a heaven-sent beam  \"Must encourage our efforts laborious.   \"For many a day we've been slipping away  \"While the savants still dozed in their slumbers;  \"Till at last came a man with gold-leaf and tin can,  \"And detected our infinite numbers.\"   So the atoms, in turn, we now clearly discern,  Fly to bits with the utmost facility;  They wend on their way, and in splitting, display  An absolute lack of stability.   'Tis clear they should halt on the grave of old Dalton  On their way to celestial spheres;  And a few thousand million - let's say a quadrillion - Should bedew it with reverent tears.   There's nothing facetious in the way that Lucretius  Imagined the chaos to quiver;  And electrons to blunder, together, asunder,  In building up atoms for ever.

Emphasis is placed  on the key observations that drove chemists and physicists to  conclude that atoms were real objects and to envision their  structure and properties. The kinetic theory of gases and  measurements of gas transport yielded good estimates for  atomic size. The discovery of the electron, proton and neutron  strongly influenced discussion of the constitution of atoms.  The observation of a massive, dense nucleus by alpha particle  scattering and the measurement of the nuclear charge resulted  in an enduring model of the nuclear atom. The role of optical  spectroscopy in the development of a theory of electronic  structure is presented. The actors in this story were often well  rewarded for their efforts to see the atoms.   Introduction  The current paradigm in chemistry celebrates the existence of physical entities   called chemical atoms (now known simply as atoms). John Dalton (1766-1844)  looked at the material world in which he lived and visualized it in terms of a set  of different material objects of small size and combining capacity (1). He called  these particles atoms in his New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808). Others,  such as Humphry Davy (1778-1829), were not yet willing to see the world in this  way. Dalton combined both a particular theory of nature and specific observations  to arrive at his views. The present paper will examine some episodes in the history  of chemistry that enabled other chemists to \"see\" atoms as appropriate chemical  constituents of our world. The view of what constitutes a chemical atom has  changed during the time period from 1808 to 2008, but the common theme requires  a context in which actual measurements can be viewed as \"evidence for atoms.\"   Â© 2010 American Chemical Society  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nSir J. J. Thomson (1856-1940), in his Romanes lecture of 1914 on \"The Atomic  Theory\" stated that \"it affords a striking proof that a theory can only grow by the  cooperation of thought and facts, and that all that is valuable in a physical theory is  not only tested, but in most cases suggested, by the study of physical phenomena  (2).\" He was one of many British scientists who played a vital part in the story of  the atom and who were knighted in the process. As the evidence regarding atoms  changed, his views on the atom changed as well. He learned to see with new eyes  on a regular basis.   The Eyes of Thermodynamics and Kinetic Theory   The 19th century was a period when the properties of matter as a function  of temperature and pressure were summarized by thermodynamic descriptions.  Many of the key concepts were pioneered by Rudolph Clausius (1822-1888). One  of the most important concepts championed by Clausius was that the particles of  the gas were in constant motion (1857). The observable pressure of the gas was  then due to the kinetic energy density of the particles and most of the volume  of the gas was void of all matter. However, the known slow mixing of gases by  diffusion revealed that, even though the mean speed of the particles was high, they  could only travel a short distance, the mean free path, before colliding with other  particles. This view of a gas as a chaotic region of constant motion and collisions  helped other scientists to see the apparently homogeneous gas phase in a new light.   James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) was intrigued by the paper of Clausius.  Even though he did not know whether there were such gas particles, he calculated  the consequences of the theory (1860) (3). A system of colliding particles would  transport momentum in the gas, and the gas viscosity would give a measure of  the physical size of the particles. The collision diameter, o, for typical gases was  found to be fractions of a nanometer (4), and Maxwell gave a stirring lecture to  the British Association in 1873 on the molecular view of matter. He distinguished  his conclusions in terms of the completeness of his knowledge. He considered  the relative masses of gas particles and the average velocities to be known with  a high degree of precision. A lower degree of certainty was associated with the  relative size of the gas particles and their mean free path. The lowest confidence  was expressed with regard to the absolute mass, absolute size, and the number  density of molecules in the gas. Josef Loschmidt (1821-1895) estimated the  number density of the gas from a consideration of the measured diffusion and the  concept of a collision diameter and a mean free path. He obtained a reasonable  value for this quantity that is now called the Loschmidt number. Maxwell was  then able to use gas viscosity data to infer the absolute size of the atoms.   If the particles were of finite size and attracted one another, the equation  of state should reflect this fact. Precise measurements of the equation of state  for carbon dioxide by Thomas Andrews (1813-1885) were reported to the Royal  Society in 1869 as the Bakerian Lecture for that year (5). These measurements  were explained by J.D. van der Waals (1837-1923) in terms of physical entities  that were characterized by both a repulsive core and an attractive potential (6).  This insight was summarized by the equation:   84  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nP(n,V,T) = nRT fna^  V-nb v V y   2   (1)   where n is the number of moles of gas particles, b is the occupied volume of  a mole of particles and a is a measure of the attractive energy of the particles.  The calculated size of the molecules was comparable to that inferred from the gas  viscosity. But, what were these particles like?! They were not rigid balls, since  they attracted one another at distances greater than the collision diameter.   Another observable property of gases is the heat capacity. The molar heat  capacity of monatomic gases was measured and found to be equal to (3/2)R, the  value predicted for a perfect (point particle) gas. But, actual atoms had a well  defined physical size. Since finite spheres would be expected to rotate, where was  the heat capacity due to rotation? Maxwell worried about this failure of the kinetic  theory. Another type of eyes was required to see this result in its proper context.   Lord Ray leigh (1842-1919) probed the argon atoms he discovered with visible  light. They scattered light in all directions. What was it that allowed the chemical  atoms to interact with light? J.C. Maxwell explained light as an electromagnetic  phenomenon. Were atoms electromagnetic objects as well? Ray leigh assumed  that atoms were electrically polarizable and he had used Maxwell's equations to  calculate the scattering of light (7). The success of this theory helped him to see  his experiments as evidence for atoms.   Jean Perrin (1870-1942) pursued the nature of atoms his whole career (8).  When the eyes of quantum mechanics were just developing in the 20th century,  Perrin reasoned that the missing rotational heat capacity was due to a very small  moment of inertia for atoms. This could only occur if the mass was concentrated in  a very small volume. He \"saw\" atoms as spherical, but not as uniformly distributed  masses. But, if most of the mass was concentrated in a very small volume, what  determined the collision diameter measured from the gas viscosity? The Eyes of Spectroscopy   The view of a chemical atom as a structureless hard sphere was shattered by  the invention of the gas discharge tube. Michael Faraday (1791-1867) was able to  produce high enough voltages to ionize gases confined to low pressure glass tubes.  The phenomenology of these early discharge tubes was complicated, but they  emitted light of both a continuous nature and a set of particular colors associated  with the precise chemical species in the tube. Better tubes were produced by H.  Geissler, and an atlas of chemical spectroscopic colors was rapidly obtained for  many elements. How could \"indivisible\" atoms produce so many colors?   J.C. Maxwell saw these atoms as capable of internal vibrations (9). Atoms  had some form of internal structure and were not static! If there were internal  modes of motion in the atoms, Boltzmann predicted that equipartition of energy  would lead to an increased heat capacity. Maxwell worried about the missing heat  capacity due to these motions as well. Maxwell died before an explanation of the   85  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\ninternal structure of atoms could be formulated, but he did have the eyes to see  them as much more interesting than the orouoc; of the Greeks.   The Eyes of Cathode Rays  Discharge tubes continued to be improved and Sir William Crookes (1832-  1919) was able to obtain vacua low enough to allow another phenomenon to be  observed: the wall of the tube glowed brightly when struck by \"cathode rays\"  (10). His Bakerian Lecture at the Royal Society in 1879 was a masterful success.  The extensive experiments of Crookes established that the new phenomenon was  due to particles that could be deflected by a magnetic field and blocked by metal  foils. They also heated the glass where they produced fluorescence. When a  low pressure gas was subjected to a high voltage, Perrin (11) observed that the  gas conducted electricity and that the cathode rays were the carriers of negative  electricity. The carrier was discovered by Sir J.J. Thomson to be a very light  particle with a charge equal to the unit of electricity (12). This \"electron\" could  be removed from the atom and had properties that could be measured separately.  Electrons obtained from different discharge tubes were all found to be identical.  For this work Thomson received the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1906.   The discovery of the \"atom of electricity\" led to a flurry of speculation  about the arrangement of the electrons inside the chemical atom. Intact chemical  atoms are electrically neutral, but Perrin observed that when the cathode rays are  produced, positive ions are also created. The notion that atoms are a combination  of positive and negative parts is one of the key insights of this period. But the  number of electrons and the nature of the positive part was still unknown.   The Eyes of Scattering   An even bigger surprise was soon observed by Henri Bequerel (1852-1908):  some atoms needed no outside encouragement to emit massive particles with  electric charges (13). The phenomenon of radioactivity changed the way we  see atoms forever. Lord Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) pursued the field and  characterized the emitted particles; they were called alpha and beta particles. The  alpha particles had a positive charge of two units and a mass equal to helium, and  the beta particles were high energy electrons originating in the nucleus. For this  work he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908. One of the key steps in  this successful experimental program was the development of a method to \"see\"  the alpha particles. One approach used a gas discharge tube with a voltage very  near the sparking point: the Geiger counter. When an alpha particle entered the  vessel, the ionization of the gas was amplified and a spike was observed on the  electrometer. The other approach used the phosphorescent properties of zinc  sulphide; alpha particles produced visible scintillations when they struck a screen  made of this mineral.   Lord Rutherford and his team of brilliant experimentalists proved beyond a  reasonable doubt that alpha particles were doubly charged ions of helium (14).  They also demonstrated spectroscopically that alpha particles became ordinary   86  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\natoms of helium when they interacted with other atoms in a low pressure gas.  What was not known was the internal structure of an ordinary atom of helium. For  example, the number of electrons associated with a helium atom was unknown, and  the size of the alpha particle was not yet known. Since alpha particles were emitted  by the heavy radioactive elements, Rutherford speculated that rapidly moving  helium atoms were a constituent of these atoms. It was supposed that the two  electrons were \"lost\" on the way out of the atom.   Once the charged particles were obtained and characterized, they could  be used as probes of intact atoms. The massive alpha particles obtained from  radium were fired at thin metal targets and the scattered particles were detected  as a function of scattering angle. Some of the particles were scattered through  very large angles. In order to produce such an outcome, atoms must contain  regions of mass and charge comparable in size and density to alpha particles.  Rutherford produced a detailed theory of the scattering of charged particles by  the massive nuclei of the heavier atoms (15). This theory was beautifully verified  by the experiments of Hans Geiger and Sir Eric Marsden (16). It was also  established experimentally that beta particles were scattered by the \"nucleus\" of  the atom. The positive charge on the nucleus was measured to be approximately  Vi the atomic mass of the heavy elements. The size of the nucleus could also be  estimated from the scattering data and was found to be very much smaller than the  overall atomic size. What Perrin inferred from thermodynamic data, Rutherford  inferred from particle scattering: atoms contain a very dense nucleus.   With a growing understanding of the charge on the nucleus, the number of  electrons needed to neutralize the charge was becoming clear. After the war,  precision measurements of the scattering of alpha particles by Sir James Chadwick  refined the value of the nuclear charge and demonstrated that it was equal to the  atomic number multiplied by the magnitude of the charge on the electron (17).   Scattering experiments were also carried out on gaseous samples of hydrogen  and helium. It was found that the nucleus of hydrogen contains a single positive  charge and the nucleus of helium a doubly positive charge. The size of the  nucleus was found to be in the femtometer range. Since the nucleus of helium has  a mass approximately four times that of hydrogen, Rutherford speculated that it  was composed of four hydrogen nuclei and two intranuclear electrons. There was  something especially stable about this arrangement, since these helium nuclei  were observed intact, as alpha particles, even after the trauma of radioactive  emission. This theory of the constitution of atomic nuclei, expressed in the  context of the triumphant paper of 1914 entitled \"The Structure of the Atom\" (18),  was the \"standard model\" until the discovery of the neutron by Chadwick. Even  though Rutherford speculated in 1920 that there might be neutral particles in the  nucleus composed of a special state of a proton and an electron, the paradigm shift  occurred only when actual neutrons were shown to exist and were characterized.   The Eyes of X-rays   When cathode rays impinge on metal targets, it is observed that a new kind  of ray is produced: x-rays. The x-rays are very short wavelength electromagnetic   87  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nradiation, comparable in size to atoms, and have proven to be ideal probes. X-rays  are scattered by atoms, and J.J. Thomson produced a detailed theory that related  the magnitude of this effect to the number of electrons in an atom (19). A value  comparable to the atomic number was obtained for the light atoms in the gas phase.  The result also depended on knowing the value of the Avogadro number, but by  this time Perrin had established its value.   The existence of the Periodic Table of the chemical elements and the concept  of the atomic number motivated A. van den Broek to assert that the nuclear  charge in a neutral atom was exactly equal to its atomic number (20). This cogent  speculation was given experimental support by the brilliant experimental work  of H.G.J. Moseley (21). He measured the frequency, v , of the characteristic  x-rays for most of the known elements using the recently discovered crystal  monochromator. A relationship was established:   v = A(N-b)2 (2)   where N is the atomic number. At least two x-ray frequencies are observed for  most elements and the value of A and b depended on whether the K or L x-rays  were being observed. The remarkable precision of this simple formula for all the  elements increased our confidence in the speculation of van den Broek.   The Eyes of Atomic Spectroscopy  As soon as the electron was discovered, speculations about the relationship   between the line spectra of atoms and the motions of the electrons were offered.  The experimental spectroscopists were also busy organizing their data into  empirically pleasing forms. In 1890 J. R. Rydberg produced an equation that  unified all the known data for hydrogen and the alkalis (22).   N o ( Â« I + A ) ( ^ 2 + / Â½ )   where n is the frequency in wavenumbers of the line, N0= 109721.6 is the Rydberg  constant, the m's are integers and the mu's are empirical values associated with  which series of lines is being considered. This suggested that the observed lines  were due to energy differences between electronic levels in the atoms, but what  were these levels?   That the observed lines were due to electrons was established by the  experiments of Pieter Zeeman (1865-1943), who examined the sodium D lines  when the atoms were in a magnetic field. The lines were broadened and the  magnitude indicated that the effect was due to particles with the charge and mass  of the electron (23). Another key observation was the polarization of the emitted  light from different parts of the line. The light in the tails was circularly polarized,  when observed along the direction of the magnetic field, while it was linearly  polarized when observed at right angles to the field.   88  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nThe key that unlocked the mystery of the line spectra was found with the  simplest atom, hydrogen. It consists of a nucleus composed of a single positive  charge and a single electron. Bohr made the assumption that since atoms are  observed to be stable, recombination of an electron and a proton can only lead  to certain discrete states (24). The energy of these states was calculated to be   iTtme\"  w = l ^\nDiscussion of the composition of the nucleus was also furthered by the  experimental discovery of the proton by Rutherford in 1918. While the singly  positively charged nucleus of the hydrogen atom was known, it was not clear  that nuclei of the higher elements contained such discrete particles. Rutherford  directed alpha particles at nitrogen gas and found that particles with the mass and  charge of the hydrogen nucleus were emitted. These particles were then identified  as the proton. The picture of the nucleus that Soddy envisioned consisted of a  number of protons equal to the mass number and enough electrons to yield a nett  (common British usage of this period) charge equal to the atomic number. If an  intranuclear electron was ejected, the atomic number then increased by one unit.   The Eyes of Mass Spectroscopy  Chemical techniques of analysis deal with a very large number of atoms and   yield averages over the sample. Once the concept of isotopes was accepted, a  search for different isotopes of every element was pursued. The key to the success  of this search was the development of a precision instrument that sampled the  atoms one at a time. It had been known since the development of the cathode  ray tube that positive ions were also produced, and early experiments with these  particles revealed singly and doubly charged species of the atoms and molecules  that were contained in the tube. Sir J.J. Thomson observed in 1912 that when  neon was the background gas, particles of mass number 20 and 22 were observed.  Attempts to obtain pure samples of the two different atoms by fractionation  techniques were unsuccessful, but in retrospect this was because they were both  neon isotopes.   Francis William Aston (1877-1945) constructed a mass spectrograph using  electromagnetic focusing that had a resolution better than 0.01 mass units. With  this device he was able to demonstrate more than 200 naturally occurring isotopes  of more than 30 elements. He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1922 and  delivered a clear lecture on the measurement and meaning of isotopes (26). He  noted that except for hydrogen, the measured atomic masses of each isotope were  very near whole numbers. It appeared that the early speculations of Prout were  returning to respectability. Aston envisioned the nucleus as \"consisting of K+N  protons and K electrons.\" This nuclear paradigm was good enough to allow the  spectacular progress in the interpretation of the electronic spectra to occur. The  current highly elaborated dynamic model of the nucleus could wait until another  era.   The Eyes of Angular Momentum   While the theory of Bohr was a major step forward, and it helped to  understand the observed hydrogen spectrum, it left many other observations in the  dark. New light was shed on the subject of atomic structure and the line spectra  by Arnold Sommerfeld (1868-1951) (27). He elaborated the basic theory of Bohr  by observing that the orbits could also be elliptical, and that for each principal  energy level, there could be a specific number of elliptical orbits of different   90  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nangular momentum. This proliferation of orbits allowed many more electrons to  be considered. Transitions between Sommerfeld orbits required a change in the  angular momentum of the atom. Well in advance of the experimental proof that  quanta of light, photons, have angular momentum, Sommerfeld concluded that  they must, since angular momentum is conserved in the optical processes that  lead to the line spectra. This insight opened the way for a whole generation of  theorists, many of whom worked for Sommerfeld, to reason from observations  to concepts that were either required by fundamental physics or were at least not  forbidden. An especially good summary of the Sommerfeld approach was written  by Leon Brillouin (28).   One important observation that demanded another great insight was the  splitting of the yellow sodium D line into a doublet. Simple transitions between  Sommerfeld orbits would yield single lines, in the absence of strong magnetic  fields that were observed by Zeeman. G.E. Uhlenbeck and S. Goudsmit proposed  that the effect was due to intrinsic angular momentum associated with the  electrons themselves (29). The magnitude of this effect was calculated to be Vi  that of the photon. The energy levels of the elliptical orbits in sodium could then  be split into ones where the electron angular momentum either added or subtracted  from the orbital angular momentum. Excellent agreement was obtained for the  value of the splitting of the sodium D line.   Using the Bohr-Sommerfeld orbits and the concept of electron spin, Brillouin  was able to explain the complicated line spectra of atoms and to calculate the term  symbols for the atomic states. While the current paradigm is usually expressed in  terms of the language of wave mechanics, Brillouin succeeded in the conceptual  world of the previous paradigm. The electronic structure of the chemical elements  could be rationalized in terms of the different orbits. A detailed treatment of the  Zeeman effect gave the correct number of orbits associated with each magnitude  of angular momentum. The spectacular success of the current view of the atom  should not prevent us from seeing the more complicated situation during this  exciting and tumultuous time in the history of the atom.   Concluding Thoughts   The picture of the chemical atom has changed substantially since the time  of Dalton, but the interplay of bold thoughts and new observations has been an  integral part of this story. The static atoms of the past have given way to the very  dynamic atoms of the present as new particles and new ideas were discovered. The  current picture of the chemical atom is grounded in the key observations presented  above. Since actual chemical atoms are still very far from everyday experience,  it remains a challenge to be able to see the atoms in the results of laboratory  experiments. A recounting of the efforts of fellow chemists and physicists from  the past to see the atoms encourages us to follow in their paths.   91  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nReferences   1.

Connecting  with artifacts and locations associated with specific historical  episodes can make those developments appear more salient.   For many years, we have been following the footsteps of the discoverers of  chemical elements. We have traveled extensively to places associated with the  various elementsâto the sites of mines, laboratories, museums and other locations  where work on the discovery of elements was carried out or where artifacts are  displayed and interpreted. Under the title \"Rediscovery of the Elements\" (1), we  have compiled guides to these sites to allow students, educators, and other curious  people to follow along, whether actually or vicariously. The project includes  extensive photographs as well as directions and coordinates.   This chapter draws upon materials gathered on our travels relevant to the  history of atoms. Much of the research described in this chapter is explained in  greater detail elsewhere in this book. This chapter selects a few places where one  can make contact with fundamental discoveries about the atom and the people who  made them.

Several commemorations of Dalton can be found  in Manchester, from an unobstrusive plaque on the site where Dalton's laboratory  once stood to a bronze statue outside the John Dalton building of Manchester  Metropolitan University.   One of the visually most interesting commemorations of Dalton in Manchester  is a painting in the Great Hall of the Manchester Town Hall. \"Dalton Collecting  Marsh-Fire Gas,\" painted by Ford Maddox Brown, is shown in Figure 1. Dalton  appears to have the assistance and attention of local children in this activity.   The site of the Dalton plaque had a rich history. Dalton's laboratory was in the  premises of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, a learned society  founded in 1781. He was a member of the Society from 1794 until his death in  1844, serving as President for 28 years. The building at 36 George Street was built  by the Society in 1799 and was its headquarters until a bombing raid destroyed it  in 1940. Many of Dalton's papers were destroyed along with the building. Some  of his possessions survive at the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry.   Figure 1. Painting by Ford Maddox Brown, \"Dalton Collecting Marsh-Fire  Gas, \" in Manchester Town Hall.

Much scientific  discussion occurred in that building on the Strand, opposite the church of St.  Clements. The tavern is the frontmost of the block of buildings shown at right  in Figure 2. Today, the church of St. Clements remains, but office buildings have  taken the place of the tavern.   Humphry Davy, William Hyde Wollaston, and Thomas Thomson were  among the prominent chemistry Fellows of the Royal Society during this time.  In 1807 and 1808, they were discussing multiple proportions and the logic of the  atomic hypothesis. Thomson's 1807^4 System of Chemistry (2) presented aspects  of Dalton's atomic theory (with permission) the year before the publication of  his own New System of Chemical Philosophy. Thomson presented to the Royal  Society work on combining ratios in salts of oxalic acid (salts we would identify  as oxalates and binoxalates) (3). Wollaston followed this paper with one on  carbonates and bicarbonates (4). He regarded his results as examples of Dalton's  general observation that compounds form in simple ratios of atoms. Thomson,  founder and editor of the journal Annals of Philosophy, was an early advocate of  Dalton's atomic theory.   Figure 2. Environs of church of St. Clements, London, including the Crown and  Anchor tavern, lower right.   95  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nle Societe d'Arcueil, Arcueil, France â Berthollet and  Gay-Lussac   Research by the French natural philosophers Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac and  Pierre-Louis Dulong during the early 19* century supported the new atomic theory.  That work was done in the laboratory of Claude-Louis Berthollet, the founder of  the Societe d'Arcueil, near Paris. Berthollet's home is shown in Figure 3. The site  of the home today is marked by a plaque, shown in Figure 4. A bust of Berthollet  can be found in Arcueil's city hall, the Centre Marius Sidobore. Arcueil itself lies  just south of the Boulevard Peripherique that rings Paris.   Berthollet's property might seem an unusual stop on a tour of atomism,  given that he did not believe in atoms. His analytical work made him skeptical of  the law of definite proportions that emerged around the turn of the 19* century.  Berthollet, on the contrary, found examples of variable proportions. The notion  of compounds arising from the union of definite small numbers of atoms, which  was a logical explanation of definite proportions, was difficult to reconcile with  variable proportions.   Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac's memoir on the combining volumes of gases  (5) contained data that Amedeo Avogadro would soon interpret atomistically  (6). Gay-Lussac was a protege and assistant of Berthollet, and he presented  this memoir before the Societe d'Arcueil. What Gay-Lussac reported is that  many reactions of gases occur in ratios of small whole numbers by volume,  such as two of hydrogen to one of oxygen to form water. Avogadro noted that  if equal volumes of gases contained equal numbers of atoms or molecules, then  the reactions themselves involved small whole-number ratios of atomsâjust as  Dalton had proposed.   Neither Gay-Lussac nor Berthollet accepted this atomistic interpretation,  though. To be sure, there was a significant stumbling block: how could two  atoms of hydrogen combine with one of oxygen to yield two atoms of water?  That is, how could the \"atom\" of oxygen be split in the course of this reaction?  Avogadro had an answer to this objection, essentially the answer that we give  today, distinguishing between atoms and molecules and positing that hydrogen  and oxygen were diatomic molecules. But Avogadro had no direct or independent  evidence for this explanation, which also contradicted notions of chemical affinity  prevalent at the time.   Dulong was also an associate of Berthollet and a member of the Societe  d'Arcueil. His 1819 paper on heat capacities of elements in collaboration with  Alexis-Therese Petit was widely interpreted as support for the atomic hypothesis.  They noted that the product of specific heat times atomic weight was very nearly  the same for a large number of solid elements. They recognized that the quantity  in question represents the heat capacities of the atomsâor in modern terms,  molar heat capacities. And they generalized the results, asserting that, \"atoms of  all simple bodies have exactly the same capacity for heat.\" (7)   96  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 3.

They introduced their spectroscope in a paper published in 1860 (8). They  emphasized the utility of the spectroscope as a very sensitive tool for qualitative  elemental analysis. They predicted that the tool would be valuable in the discovery  of yet unknown elements. They noted that the spectroscope had convinced them  of the existence of another alkali metal besides lithium, sodium, and potassium;  eventually they found twoâcesium and rubidium. In that 1860 paper, they noted  that their instrument could shed light on the chemical composition of the sun  and starsânot many years after Auguste Comte wrote that such knowledge was  beyond the reach of human beings.   Figure 5 shows the spectroscope as depicted in their paper (above) and on  display at Heidelberg University (below). Note the flame sourceâa Bunsen  burner, of course. The display is in the chemistry department at the University's  new campus in Neuenheim, across the river from the old city.   Kirchhoff would distinguish three kinds of spectra: continuous spectra of  black-body radiation (a term he coined), bright-line spectra from hot sources,  and dark-line spectra of light passing through cool samples. Already by 1860 he  recognized that the bright-line emission spectra of hot gases are coincident with  the dark-line absorption spectra of cool gases.   Spectroscopy was to prove indispensable in unlocking the structure of atoms,  particulary their electronic structureâbut those developments would depend on  other, later researchers. Max Planck's analysis of blackbody radiation and Bohr's  theory of the hydrogen spectrum are just two examples.   The old city is where Bunsen and Kirchhoff worked. Figure 6 shows a statue  of Bunsen on the main street of the old city of Heidelberg. The statue is in front of a  building where Kirchhoff lived. Across the street is the building, shown in Figure  7, where Kirchhoff developed a theory and method of spectroscopy and where he  and Bunsen discovered cesium and rubidium. The building, \"Zum Reisen\" had  been a distillery in the 18th century before the University had acquired it. The  unassuming plaque on the building says (in translation), \"In this building in 1859,  Kirchhoff founded spectral analysis with Bunsen and applied it to the sun and stars,  thereby opening the study of the chemistry of the universe.\"   Bunsen was quite imposing physically. He was tall (six feet) and he has been  described as \"built like Hercules.\" (P)He was apparently impervious to pain, for he  was said to be able to handle hot objects with total disregard, picking up the lid of a  glowing porcelain crucible with his bare fingers (10). When he was blowing glass,  one could sometimes smell burnt flesh, according to English chemist Henry Enfield  Roscoe, who worked with Bunsen in Heidelberg (11). A modest man of simple  manners, Bunsen placed great value on facts and little on theories or systems. In  his last lectures in 1889, Bunsen did not refer to the periodic law, despite the fact  that both of its principal formulators, Dmitri Mendeleev and Julius Lothar Meyer,  had worked with him in Heidelberg.   98  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 5.

He shared the 1882 Davy Medal of the Royal Society (London) with Mendeleev  for discovery of the periodic law. Today, Mendeleev is the first name associated  with the discovery of the periodic law and invention of the periodic table. In most  accounts, though, Meyer stands second.   Meyer included a partial periodic table of 28 elements in the first edition of  his Modernen Theorien der Chemie published in 1864. The table only included  slightly more than half of the elements then known, but those elements are arranged  in order of increasing atomic weights and aligned in columns according to valence.  While preparing a second edition of the book in 1868, Meyer prepared a more  comprehensive table, which he did not publish (12). He did publish a periodic  table in 1870 in Annalen (13). That paper included a plot of atomic volume that  displays the periodicity of that elemental property as well as a periodic table that  many consider superior to Mendeleev's 1869 table.   Meyer was a professor at the Forstakademie (Forestry School) in Eberswalde  when he formulated his unpublished comprehensive table. The building where  he worked is shown in Figure 8. (Eberswalde is in the northeast of Germany,  northeast of Berlin, not far from the Polish border.) Meyer moved to the Karlsruhe  Polytechnikum in 1868, and he left his table in Eberswalde with his successor,  Adolf Remele. Carl Seubert, one of Remele's colleagues, published that table in  1895 after Meyer's death (12).   Figure 8.

Columns in Varel, Germany, bearing sculpted heads of Julius Lothar  Meyer, Dmitri Mendeleev, and Stanislao Cannizzaro. (Photo Copyright J. L. and   V. R. Marshall.)   Meyer was born in 1830 in Varel, not far from the North Sea in what is  now Germany. (At the time of Meyer's birth it had been part of the Duchy of  Oldenburg.) His birthplace is marked by a plaque, and there is a school named  for him, Lothar-Meyer-Gymnasium. A more interesting memorial is shown in  Figure 9, three columns bearing sculpted heads of Meyer, Mendeleev, and the  Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro.   In 1860, these three chemists were all together in the flesh elsewhere in  Germany. They were all among the attendees of the first international congress of  chemists held that year in Karlsruhe. The purpose for gathering chemists from  throughout Europe was to discuss and if possible define such important chemical  terms as atom, molecule, and equivalent. Although the attendees were mindful  that they had no authority to legislate on such matters, they hoped to bring clarity  to the questions they would discuss.   In retrospect, the Karlsruhe Congress brought about widespread agreement on  a system of atomic weights, and Cannizzaro deserves much of the credit for it. He  spoke in the conference hall on reliable methods for determining atomic weights  based on Avogadro's hypothesis, vapor densities, and specific heats. He also  distributed a reprint of his sketch of a course of chemical philosophy, published  two years earlier (14). Meyer later recalled reading Cannizzaro's pamphlet on his  way home from the conference: \"It was as though the scales fell from my eyes.\"  (12) Historians of the periodic law consider the development of a consistent set  of atomic weights to have been a prerequisite to the discovery of the periodic law  and the Karlsruhe Congress a key event.   102  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 10. Stdndehaus (right) in Karlsruhe, Germany in 1860 (above) and at  present (below). (Photo (below) Copyright J. L. and V. R. Marshall.)   The Congress met in the Standehaus, the home of the parliament of the Grand  Duchy of Baden, courtesy of the Archduke. That building is no longer in existence;  however, its modern replacement evokes the style of the old one. (Figure 10 shows  exterior views of the old Standehaus (above) and the new one (below).) The new  Standehaus contains photos, displays, and other records of the original.   While in Karlsruhe, one can visit the building where Meyer worked at the  Polytechnicum (now part of Karlsruhe Universitat), but there are no memorials to  him there. Karlsruhe is one of three cities in southwestern Germany where Meyer  lived and worked. As mentioned above, he worked with Bunsen in Heidelberg.  Tubingen is the third city. Meyer spent the last 20 years of his life as professor  at its university, and he died there in 1895. The university now has a geology  building named in his honor.   103  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nMcGill University, Montreal, Canada â Rutherford and Soddy   The last sites visited in this chapter are associated with Ernest Rutherford and  Frederick Soddy, pioneers in the study of radioactivity. Radioactivity is one of  the phenomena that led chemists and physicists to understand that atoms were not  indestructible or indivisible.   Rutherford spent about a decade in the Macdonald Chair of Physics at McGill  University in Montreal, Canada. The old physics building, where he worked,  is shown in Figure 11. He arrived there originally from New Zealand by way  of Cambridge, England, where he had worked with J. J. Thompson. While at  McGill, Rutherford discovered a radioactive \"emanation\" from thorium, which  we know as radon (15). He characterized the time-dependence of radioactive  emission (exponential decay) and applied the term half-life to the phenomenon  (16). He studied the a particle extensively, beginning the series of experiments  that would lead to the discovery of the nucleus (17). And, working with Frederick  Soddy, he carried out the research for which he would receive the 1908 Nobel  Prize in Chemistry. Soddy arrived at McGill from Oxford in 1900 to take the  post of Demonstrator of chemistry. His was there for only about two years before  returning to England to work with Sir William Ramsay at University College,  London.   Figure 11. Old Physics Building at McGill University, Montreal.

The chemical transformations  were far from obvious. The readily observable phenomenon in radioactivity is  the penetrating radiation; the material that emits the radiation appeared, to no less  an observer than Marie Curie, to be unchanged. Rutherford and Soddy saw the  change, and they inferred (partly on the basis of Curie's work) that these chemical  changes were at the atomic or subatomic level. \"Since, therefore, radioactivity  is at once an atomic phenomenon and accompanied by chemical changes in  which new types of matter are produced, these changes must be occurring  within the atom, and the radioactive elements must be undergoing spontaneous  transformation. ... Radioactivity may therefore be considered as a manifestation  of subatomic chemical change.\" (18) More than 100 years later, it is difficult to  realize just how radical this assertion was: atoms were falling apart on their own,  in the process changing into atoms of other elements.   At McGill, there is a display on Rutherford including a sculpted bust,  descriptions and diagrams of his research, and some pieces of experimental  apparatus. There is also a plaque in honor of Soddy at McGill, noting the time  he spent as a \"member of the staff in the chemistry department\" and describing  his collaboration with Rutherford. Their investigations \"led to discoveries of  fundamendtal importance,\" according to the plaque, \"including the natural  transmutation of elements.\" By the time the plaque was erected, the research was  not only accepted but acclaimed; so the plaque could use the word that Rutherford  and Soddy dared notâtransmutation.   Glasgow, Scotland â Soddy   Rutherford was the sole recipient of the 1908 Nobel Prize in chemistry, \"for  his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of  radioactive substances.\" By that time, he was back in England, in Manchester,  where we began this chapter.   Soddy did not share that Nobel, but he would win one of his own in 1921 \"for  his contributions to our knowledge of the chemistry of radioactive substances, and  his investigations into the origin and nature of isotopes.\" The research conducted  at McGill with Rutherford certainly falls under the first part of the citation.   The latter part of the citation covers work Soddy carried out while at the  University of Glasgow. While there, he developed the displacement law of  radioactive transformation, whereby an emitter of a radiation is displaced two  places to the left in the periodic table (i.e., it is transformed into the element two  to the right) and an emitter of (3 radiation is displaced one to the right. He also  introduced the term isotope, a word suggested to him in the building shown in  Figure 12.   105  In Atoms in Chemistry: From Dalton's Predecessors to Complex Atoms and Beyond; Giunta, C;   ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2010.\nFigure 12. George Service House, University Gardens, Glasgow, Scotland, where  the term isotope was born. (Photo Copyright J. L. and V. R. Marshall.)   Now we describe isotopes as atoms of the same element that have different  nuclei, usually because they have different number of neutrons in the nucleus.  Soddy introduced the term to describe elements that \"occupy the same place in the  periodic table.\" He said that \"isotopes\" or \"isotopic elements\" were chemically  identical and, in most respects that do not depend on the atomic mass, physically  identical as well (19). The term is derived from the Greek iso- (same) and topos  (place).   Soddy introduced the term, but it was Dr. Margaret Todd who coined it. This  was done at a dinner party in 1913 at the home of Soddy's father-in-law, Sir George  Beilby. A plaque on the house marks the occasion.   References   1. Marshall, J. L.; Marshall, V. R.

                "In both astrology and historical astronomy, the zodiac (Greek: ζῳδιακός, zōidiakos) is a circle of twelve 30° divisions of celestial longitude that are centered upon the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the course of the year. The paths of the Moon and visible planets also remain close to the ecliptic, within the belt of the zodiac, which extends 8-9° north or south of the ecliptic, as measured in celestial latitude. Because the divisions are regular, they do not correspond exactly to the boundaries of the twelve constellations after which they are named.\n\nHistorically, these twelve divisions are called signs. Essentially, the zodiac is a celestial coordinate system, or more specifically an ecliptic coordinate system, which takes the ecliptic as the origin of latitude, and the position of the Sun at vernal equinox as the origin of longitude.\n\nUsage \n\nThe zodiac was in use by the Roman era, based on concepts inherited by Hellenistic astronomy from Babylonian astronomy of the Chaldean period (mid-1st millennium BC), which, in turn, derived from an earlier system of lists of stars along the ecliptic.  The construction of the zodiac is described in Ptolemy's vast 2nd century AD work, the Almagest. \n\nThe term zodiac derives from Latin zōdiacus, which in its turn comes from the Greek  (zōdiakos kyklos), meaning \"circle of animals\", derived from  (zōdion), the diminutive of  (zōon) \"animal\". The name is motivated by the fact that half of the signs of the classical Greek zodiac are represented as animals (besides two mythological hybrids).\n\nAlthough the zodiac remains the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system in use in astronomy besides the equatorial one,  the term and the names of the twelve signs are today mostly associated with horoscopic astrology.  The term \"zodiac\" may also refer to the region of the celestial sphere encompassing the paths of the planets corresponding to the band of about eight arc degrees above and below the ecliptic. The zodiac of a given planet is the band that contains the path of that particular body; e.g., the \"zodiac of the Moon\" is the band of five degrees above and below the ecliptic. By extension, the \"zodiac of the comets\" may refer to the band encompassing most short-period comets. \n\nHistory \n\nEarly history \n\nThe division of the ecliptic into the zodiacal signs originates in Babylonian (\"Chaldean\") astronomy during the first half of the 1st millennium BC, likely during Median/\"Neo-Babylonian\" times (7th century BC). \nThe classical zodiac is a modification of the MUL.APIN catalogue, which was compiled around 1000 BC.\nSome of the constellations can be traced even further back, to Bronze Age (Old Babylonian) sources,  including Gemini \"The Twins\", from MAŠ.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL \"The Great Twins\", and Cancer \"The Crab\", from AL.LUL \"The Crayfish\", among others.\n\nBabylonian astronomers at some stage during the early 1st millennium BC divided the ecliptic into twelve equal zones of celestial longitude to create the first known celestial coordinate system: a coordinate system that boasts some advantages over modern systems (such as the equatorial coordinate system). The Babylonian calendar as it stood in the 7th century BC assigned each month to a sign, beginning with the position of the Sun at vernal equinox, which, at the time, was depicted as the Aries constellation (\"Age of Aries\"), for which reason the first sign is still called \"Aries\" even after the vernal equinox has moved away from the Aries constellation due to the slow precession of the Earth's axis of rotation. \n\nBecause the division was made into equal arcs, 30° each, they constituted an ideal system of reference for making predictions about a planet's longitude. However, Babylonian techniques of observational measurements were in a rudimentary stage of evolution and it is unclear whether they had techniques to define in a precise way the boundary lines between the zodiacal signs in the sky.  Thus, the need to use stars close to the ecliptic (±9° of latitude) as a set of observational reference points to help positioning a planet within this ecliptic coordinate system.  Constellations were given the names of the signs and asterisms could be connected in a way that would resemble the sign's name. Therefore, in spite of its conceptual origin, the Babylonian zodiac became sidereal. \n\nIn Babylonian astronomical diaries, a planet position was generally given with respect to a zodiacal sign alone, less often in specific degrees within a sign.  When the degrees of longitude were given, they were expressed with reference to the 30° of the zodiacal sign, i.e., not with a reference to the continuous 360° ecliptic.  To the construction of their mathematical ephemerides, daily positions of a planet were not as important as the dates when the planet crossed from one zodiacal sign to the next. \n\nHebrew astrology \n\nKnowledge of the Babylonian zodiac is also reflected in the Tanakh, but is the first recorded astrological division into 12 constellations, elaborated on in the Talmuds, books of the Midrash Rabba, and other minor works. E. W. Bullinger interpreted the creatures appearing in the book of Ezekiel as the middle signs of the four quarters of the Zodiac,   with the Lion as Leo, the Bull is Taurus, the Man representing Aquarius and the Eagle representing Scorpio.  Some authors have linked the twelve tribes of Israel with the twelve signs. Martin and others have argued that the arrangement of the tribes around the Tabernacle (reported in the Book of Numbers) corresponded to the order of the Zodiac, with Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan representing the middle signs of Leo, Aquarius, Taurus, and Scorpio, respectively.Such connections were taken up by Thomas Mann, who in his novel Joseph and His Brothers attributes characteristics of a sign of the zodiac to each tribe in his rendition of the Blessing of Jacob.\n\nHellenistic and Roman era \n\nThe Babylonian star catalogs entered Greek astronomy in the 4th century BC, via Eudoxus of Cnidus. \n \nBabylonia or Chaldea in the Hellenistic world came to be so identified with astrology that \"Chaldean wisdom\" became among Greeks and Romans the synonym of divination through the planets and stars. \nHellenistic astrology derived in part from Babylonian and Egyptian astrology. \nHoroscopic astrology first appeared in Ptolemaic Egypt. The Dendera zodiac, a relief dating to ca. 50 BC, is the first known depiction of the classical zodiac of twelve signs.\n\nParticularly important in the development of Western horoscopic astrology was the astrologer and astronomer Ptolemy, whose work Tetrabiblos laid the basis of the Western astrological tradition.  Under the Greeks, and Ptolemy in particular, the planets, Houses, and signs of the zodiac were rationalized and their function set down in a way that has changed little to the present day.   Ptolemy lived in the 2nd century AD, three centuries after the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes by Hipparchus around 130 BC. Hipparchus's lost work on precession never circulated very widely until it was brought to prominence by Ptolemy,  and there are few explanations of precession outside the work of Ptolemy until late Antiquity, by which time Ptolemy's influence was widely established. Ptolemy clearly explained the theoretical basis of the western zodiac as being a  tropical coordinate system, by which the zodiac is aligned to the equinoxes and solstices, rather than the visible constellations that bear the same names as the zodiac signs. \n\nHindu zodiac \n\nThe Hindu zodiac uses the sidereal coordinate system, which makes reference to the fixed stars. The Tropical zodiac (of Mesopotamian origin) is divided by the intersections of the ecliptic and equator, which shifts in relation to the backdrop of fixed stars at a rate of 1° every 72 years, creating the phenomenon known as precession of the equinoxes. The Hindu zodiac, being sidereal, does not maintain this seasonal alignment, but there are still similarities between the two systems. The Hindu zodiac signs and corresponding Greek signs sound very different, being in Sanskrit and Greek respectively, but their symbols are nearly identical.  For example, dhanu means \"bow\" and corresponds to Sagittarius, the \"archer\", and kumbha means \"water-pitcher\" and corresponds to Aquarius, the \"water-carrier\". \n\nMiddle Ages \n\nThe High Middle Ages saw a revival of Greco-Roman magic, first in Kabbalism and later continued in Renaissance magic. This included magical uses of the zodiac, as found, e.g., in  the Sefer Raziel HaMalakh.\n\nThe zodiac is found in mediaeval stained glass as at Angers Cathedral, where the master glassmaker, André Robin, made the ornate rosettes for the North and South transepts after the fire there in 1451. \n\nEarly modern \n\nAn example of the use of signs as astronomical coordinates may be found in the Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the year 1767. The \"Longitude of the Sun\" columns show the sign (represented as a digit from 0 to and including 11), degrees from 0 to 29, minutes, and seconds. \n\nThe zodiacal symbols are Early Modern simplifications of conventional pictorial representations of the signs, attested since Hellenistic times.\n\nTwelve signs \n\nWhat follows is a list of the twelve signs of the modern zodiac (with the ecliptic longitudes of their first points), where 0° Aries is understood as the vernal equinox, with their Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and Babylonian names (but note that the Sanskrit and the Babylonian name equivalents (after c.500 BC) denote the constellations only, not the tropical zodiac signs). Also, the \"English translation\" is not usually used by English speakers. The Latin names are standard English usage.\n\nConstellations \n\nThe zodiacal signs are distinct from the constellations associated with them, not only because of their drifting apart due to the precession of equinoxes but also because the physical constellations take up varying widths of the ecliptic, so the Sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time. Thus, Virgo takes up five times as much ecliptic longitude as  Scorpius. The zodiacal signs are an abstraction from the physical constellations, and each represent exactly one twelfth of the full circle, or the longitude traversed by the Sun in about 30.4 days. \n\nSome \"parazodiacal\" constellations are also touched by the paths of the planets. The MUL.APIN lists Orion, Perseus, Auriga, and Andromeda. Furthermore, there are a number of constellations mythologically associated with the zodiacal ones : Piscis Austrinus, The Southern Fish, is attached to Aquarius. In classical maps, it swallows the stream poured out of Aquarius' pitcher, but perhaps it formerly just swam in it. Aquila, The Eagle, was possibly associated with the zodiac by virtue of its main star, Altair. Hydra in the Early Bronze Age marked the celestial equator and was associated with Leo, which is shown standing on the serpent on the Dendera zodiac. Corvus is the Crow or Raven mysteriously perched on the tail of Hydra.\n\nDue to the constellation boundaries being redefined in 1930 by the International Astronomical Union, the path of the ecliptic now officially passes through thirteen constellations: the twelve traditional 'zodiac constellations' plus  Ophiuchus, the bottom part of which interjects between Scorpio and Sagittarius. Ophiuchus is an anciently recognized constellation, catalogued along with many others in Ptolemy's Almagest, but not historically referred to as a zodiac constellation.   The inaccurate description of Ophiuchus as a sign of the zodiac drew media attention in 1995, when the BBC Nine O'Clock News reported that \"an extra sign of the zodiac has been announced by the Royal Astronomical Society\".  There had been no such announcement, and the report had merely sensationalized the 67-year-old 'news' of the IAU's decision to alter the number of designated ecliptic constellations.  \n\nTable of dates \n\nThe following table compares the Gregorian dates on which the Sun enters\n*a sign in the Ptolemaic tropical zodiac\n*a sign in the Hindu sidereal system\n*the astronomical constellation of the same name as the sign, with constellation boundaries as defined in 1930 by the International Astronomical Union.\n\nThe theoretical beginning of Aries is the moment of vernal equinox, and all other dates shift accordingly.\n\nThe precise Gregorian times and dates vary slightly from year to year as the Gregorian calendar shifts relative to the tropical year.  These variations remain within less than two days' difference in the recent past and the near-future,  vernal equinox in UT always falling either on 20 or 21 March in the period of 1797 to 2043, falling on 19 March in 1796 the last time and in 2044 the next. \n\nBecause the Earth's axis is at an angle, some signs take longer to rise than others, and the farther away from the equator the observer is situated, the greater the difference. Thus, signs are spoken of as \"long\" or \"short\" ascension. \n\nPrecession of the equinoxes \n\nThe zodiac system was developed in Babylonia, some 2,500 years ago, during the \"Age of Aries\".  At the time, it is assumed, the precession of the equinoxes was unknown, as the system made no allowance for it. Contemporary use of the coordinate system is presented with the choice of interpreting the system either as sidereal, with the signs fixed to the stellar background, or as tropical, with the signs fixed to the point of vernal equinox. \n\nWestern astrology takes the tropical approach, whereas Hindu astrology takes the sidereal one. This results in the originally unified zodiacal coordinate system drifting apart gradually, with a clockwise(westward) precession of 1.4 degrees per century.\n\nFor the tropical zodiac used in Western astronomy and astrology, this means that the tropical sign of Aries currently lies somewhere within the constellation Pisces (\"Age of Pisces\").\n\nThe sidereal coordinate system takes into account the ayanamsa, ayan meaning transit or movement, and amsa meaning small part, i.e. movement of equinoxes in small parts. It is unclear when Indians became aware of the precession of the equinoxes, but Bhaskar II's 12th-century treatise Siddhanta Shiromani gives equations for measurement of precession of equinoxes, and says his equations are based on some lost equations of Suryasiddhanta plus the equation of Munjaala.\n\nThe discovery of precession is attributed to Hipparchus around 130 BC. Ptolemy quotes from Hipparchus’ now lost work entitled “On the Displacement of the Solstitial and Equinoctial Points” in the seventh book of his 2nd century astronomical text, Almagest, where he describes the phenomenon of precession and estimates its value. Ptolemy clarified that the convention of Greek mathematical astronomy was to commence the zodiac from the point of the vernal equinox and to always refer to this point as “the first degree” of Aries. This is known as the “tropical zodiac” (from the Greek word trópos, turn)  because its starting point revolves through the circle of background constellations over time.\n\nThe principle of the vernal point acting as the first degree of the zodiac for Greek astronomers is also described in the 1st century BC astronomical text of Geminus of Rhodes. Geminus explains that Greek astronomers of his era associate the first degrees of the zodiac signs with the two solstices and the two equinoxes, in contrast to the older Chaldean (Babylonian) system, which placed these points within the zodiac signs. This illustrates that Ptolemy merely clarified the convention of Greek astronomers and did not originate the principle of the tropical zodiac, as is sometimes assumed.\n\nPtolemy also demonstrates that the principle of the tropical zodiac was well known to his predecessors within his astrological text, the Tetrabiblos, where he explains why it would be an error to associate the regularly spaced signs of the seasonally aligned zodiac with the irregular boundaries of the visible constellations:\n\n:The beginnings of the signs, and likewise those of the terms, are to be taken from the equinoctial and tropical points. This rule is not only clearly stated by writers on the subject, but is also especially evident by the demonstration constantly afforded, that their natures, influences and familiarities have no other origin than from the tropics and equinoxes, as has been already plainly shown. And, if other beginnings were allowed, it would either be necessary to exclude the natures of the signs from the theory of prognostication, or impossible to avoid error in then retaining and making use of them; as the regularity of their spaces and distances, upon which their influence depends, would then be invaded and broken in upon.\n\nIn modern astronomy \n\nAstronomically, the zodiac defines a belt of space extending 9° either side of the ecliptic, within which the orbits of the Moon and the principal planets remain.  It is a feature of a celestial coordinate system centered upon the ecliptic, (the plane of the Earth's orbit and the Sun's apparent path), by which celestial longitude is measured in degrees east of the vernal equinox (the ascending intersection of the ecliptic and equator). \n\nThe Sun's placement upon the vernal equinox, which occurs annually around 21 March, defines the starting point for measurement, the first degree of which is historically known as the \"first point of Aries\". The first 30° along the ecliptic is nominally designated as the zodiac sign Aries, which no longer falls within the proximity of the constellation Aries since the effect of precession is to move the vernal point through the backdrop of visible constellations (it is currently located near the end of the constellation Pisces, having been within that constellation since the 2nd century AD).  The subsequent 30° of the ecliptic is nominally designated the zodiac sign Taurus, and so on through the twelve signs of the zodiac so that each occupies 1/12th (30°) of the zodiac's great circle. Zodiac signs have never been used to determine the boundaries of astronomical constellations that lie in the vicinity of the zodiac, which are, and always have been, irregular in their size and shape.\n\nThe convention of measuring celestial longitude within individual signs was still being used in the mid-19th century,  but modern astronomy now numbers degrees of celestial longitude from 0° to 360°, rather than 0° to 30° within each sign.\n\nThe use of the zodiac as a means to determine astronomical measurement remained the main method for defining celestial positions by Western astronomers until the Renaissance, at which time preference moved to the equatorial coordinate system, which measures astronomical positions by right ascension and declination rather than the ecliptic-based definitions of celestial longitude and celestial latitude.\n\nThe word \"zodiac\" is also used in reference to the zodiacal cloud of dust grains that move among the planets, and the zodiacal light that originates from their scattering of sunlight.\n\nMnemonics\n\nThere are many mnemonics for remembering the 12 signs of the zodiac in order. A traditional mnemonic: \nThe ram, the bull, the heavenly twins,\nAnd next the crab, the lion shines,\nThe virgin and the scales,\nThe scorpion, archer, and the goat,\nThe man who holds the watering-pot,\nAnd fish with glittering scales.\n\nA less poetic, but succinct mnemonic is the following: \nThe Ramble Twins Crab Liverish;\nScaly Scorpions Are Good Water Fish.\n\nMnemonics in which the initials of the words correspond to the initials of the star signs (Latin, English, or mixed):\nAll The Great Constellations Live Very Long Since Stars Can't Alter Physics. \nAs The Great Cook Likes Very Little Salt, She Compensates Adding Pepper.\nAll That Gold Can Load Very Lazy Students Since Children Are at Play\n\nModern mnemonics which use calendar order (January to December order) are arbitrary.  For example,\n\n\"Capped aqueous poisons are tainting good crab legs vaguely like scorched sage\" corresponds to\nCapricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius.\n\nOr, for astronomical IAU boundaries, \"Sadly, capsized, aqueous pollutants are tainting good crabs leaving via liberally scorched Oregon\" starts with Sagittarius in January and includes Ophiuchus in December.\n\nUnicode characters\n\nIn Unicode, the symbols of zodiac signs are encoded in block Miscellaneous Symbols: \n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n\nIn Unicode 6.0 the sign for Ophiuchus has been added, too:"

                "Luxembourg (; ), officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital Luxembourg City is together with Brussels and Strasbourg  one of the three official capitals of the European Union and seat of the European Court of Justice, highest juridical instance in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union. \n\nIt comprises two principal regions: the Oesling in the north as part of the Ardennes massif, and the Gutland (\"Good Land\") in the south.  With an area of , it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe (about the same size as the state of Rhode Island or the English county of Northamptonshire).  Luxembourg had a population of 524,853 in October 2012, ranking it the 8th least-populous country in Europe.  As a representative democracy with a constitutional monarch, it is headed by a grand duke, Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and is the world's only remaining grand duchy. Luxembourg is a developed country, with an advanced economy and the world's highest GDP (PPP) per capita, according to the United Nations in 2014. Its central location has historically made it of great strategic importance to numerous powers, dating back to its founding as a Roman fortress, its hosting of a vital Frankish castle during the Early Middle Ages, and its role as a bastion for the Spanish Road between the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nLuxembourg is a founding member of the European Union, OECD, United Nations, NATO, and Benelux, reflecting its political consensus in favour of economic, political, and military integration. The city of Luxembourg, which is the country's capital and largest city, is the seat of several institutions and agencies of the EU. Luxembourg served on the United Nations Security Council for the years 2013 and 2014, which was a first in the country's history.  In 2016, Luxembourgish citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 172 countries and territories, ranking the Luxembourgian passport 6th in the world, tied with countries such as Canada and Switzerland. \n\nHistory\n\nFile:Karl IV. (HRR).jpg|Charles IV, the 14th century Holy Roman Emperor and king of Bohemia from the House of Luxembourg. \nFile:Festungsplan.von.Luxemburg.jpg|Historic map (undated) of Luxembourg city's fortifications \nFile:Luxembourg fortress before demolition.jpg|Photograph of the fortress of Luxembourg prior to demolition in 1867\n\nCounty\n\nThe recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of Lucilinburhuc  (today Luxembourg Castle) situated on the Bock rock by Siegfried, Count of Ardennes, in 963 through an exchange act with St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier.  Around this fort, a town gradually developed, which became the centre of a state of great strategic value.\n\nDuchy\n\nIn the 14th and early 15th centuries, three members of the House of Luxembourg reigned as Holy Roman Emperors. In 1437, the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne, which led to the territories being sold by Duchess Elisabeth to Philip the Good of Burgundy. \n\nIn the following centuries, Luxembourg's fortress was steadily enlarged and strengthened by its successive occupants, the Bourbons, Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns and the French.\n\nNineteenth century\n\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Luxembourg was disputed between Prussia and the Netherlands. The Congress of Vienna formed Luxembourg as a Grand Duchy within the German Confederation in personal union with the Netherlands, being at the same time a part of the Netherlands and ruled as one of its provinces, with the Fortress of Luxembourg manned by Prussian troops.  This arrangement was revised by the 1839 First Treaty of London, from which date Luxembourg's full independence is reckoned.    \n\nAt the time of the Belgian Revolution of 1830–1839, and by the 1839 Treaty establishing full independence, Luxembourg's territory was reduced by more than half, as the predominantly francophone western part of the country was transferred to Belgium. In 1842, Luxembourg joined the German Customs Union (Zollverein).  This resulted in the opening of the German market, the development of Luxembourg's steel industry, and expansion of Luxembourg's railway network from 1855 to 1875, particularly the construction of the Luxembourg-Thionville railway line, with connections from there to the European industrial regions.   While Prussian troops still manned the fortress, in 1861 the Passerelle was opened, the first road bridge spanning the Pétrusse river valley, connecting the Ville Haute and the main fortification on the Bock with Luxembourg railway station, opened in 1859, on the then fortified Bourbon plateau to the south.\n\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis of 1866 nearly led to war between Prussia and France, the Grand Duchy's independence and neutrality were again affirmed by the 1867 Second Treaty of London, Prussia's troops were withdrawn from the Fortress of Luxembourg and its Bock and surrounding fortifications were dismantled. \n\nThe King of the Netherlands remained Head of State as Grand Duke of Luxembourg, maintaining personal union between the two countries until 1890. At the death of William III, the Netherlands throne passed to his daughter Wilhelmina, while Luxembourg (then restricted to male heirs by the Nassau Family Pact) passed to Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg. \n\nAt the time of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, despite allegations about French use of the Luxembourg railways for passing soldiers from Metz (then part of France) through the Duchy, and for forwarding provisions to Thionville, Luxembourg's neutrality was respected by Germany, and neither France nor Germany invaded the country.   But in 1871, as a result of Germany's victory over France,  Luxembourg's boundary with Lorraine, containing Metz and Thionville, changed from being a frontier with a part of France to a frontier with territory annexed to the German Empire as Alsace-Lorraine under the Treaty of Frankfurt. This allowed Germany the military advantage of controlling and expanding the railways there. \n\nTwentieth century\n\nIn August 1914, Imperial Germany violated Luxembourg's neutrality by invading it in its war against France. This allowed Germany to use the railway lines, while at the same time denying them to France. Nevertheless, despite the German occupation, Luxembourg was allowed to maintain much of its independence and political mechanisms.\n\nIn 1940, after the outbreak of World War II, Luxembourg's neutrality was again violated when the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany entered the country, \"entirely without justification\".  In contrast to the First World War, under the German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II, the country was treated as German territory and informally annexed to the adjacent province of the Third Reich. A government in exile based in London supported the Allies, sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion. Luxembourg was liberated in September 1944, and became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. Luxembourg's neutral status under the constitution formally ended in 1948, and in 1949 it became a founding member of NATO.\n\nIn 1951, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Coal and Steel Community, which in 1957 would become the European Economic Community and in 1993 the European Union, and in 1999 Luxembourg joined the euro currency area. In 2005, a referendum on the EU treaty establishing a constitution for Europe was held in Luxembourg. \n\nPolitics\n\nLuxembourg is a parliamentary democracy headed by a constitutional monarch. Under the constitution of 1868, executive power is exercised by the Grand Duke and the cabinet, which consists of several other ministers.  The Grand Duke has the power to dissolve the legislature, in which case new elections must be held within three months. However, since 1919, sovereignty has resided with the Nation, exercised by the Grand Duke in accordance with the Constitution and the law. \n\nLegislative power is vested in the Chamber of Deputies, a unicameral legislature of sixty members, who are directly elected to five-year terms from four constituencies. A second body, the Council of State (Conseil d'État), composed of twenty-one ordinary citizens appointed by the Grand Duke, advises the Chamber of Deputies in the drafting of legislation. \n\nThe Grand Duchy has three lower tribunals (justices de paix; in Esch-sur-Alzette, the city of Luxembourg, and Diekirch), two district tribunals (Luxembourg and Diekirch) and a Superior Court of Justice (Luxembourg), which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation. There is also an Administrative Tribunal and an Administrative Court, as well as a Constitutional Court, all of which are located in the capital.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nLuxembourg is divided into 3 districts, which are further divided into 12 cantons and then 105 communes.  Twelve of the communes have city status, of which the city of Luxembourg is the largest.\n\nThe districts are Diekirch, Grevenmacher, and Luxembourg.\n\nFile:LuxembourgPartitionsMap english.png|The three Partitions of Luxembourg have greatly reduced Luxembourg's territory.\nFile:Luxemburg districts.svg|Districts of Luxembourg\n\nForeign relations\n\nLuxembourg has long been a prominent supporter of European political and economic integration. In efforts foreshadowing European integration, Luxembourg and Belgium in 1921 formed the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) to create an inter-exchangeable currency and a common customs regime. Luxembourg is a member of the Benelux Economic Union and was one of the founding members of the European Economic Community (now the European Union). It also participates in the Schengen Group (named after the Luxembourg village of Schengen where the agreements were signed), whose goal is the free movement of citizens among member states. At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro-NATO, pro-US foreign policy. \n\nLuxembourg is the site of the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, the Statistical Office of the European Communities (\"Eurostat\") and other vital EU organs. The Secretariat of the European Parliament is located in Luxembourg, but the Parliament usually meets in Brussels and sometimes in Strasbourg.\n\nMilitary\n\nLuxembourg contributes an army of about 800 soldiers and 100 civil servants to its defense and to NATO. As a landlocked country, it has no navy.\n\nLuxembourg also lacks an air force, though the 17 NATO AWACS aeroplanes are, for convenience, registered as aircraft of Luxembourg.  In accordance with a joint agreement with Belgium, both countries have put forth funding for one A400M military cargo plane. \n\nGeography\n\nLuxembourg is one of the smallest countries in Europe, and ranked 179th in size of all the 194 independent countries of the world; the country is about  in size, and measures 82 km long and 57 km wide. It lies between latitudes 49° and 51° N, and longitudes 5° and 7° E.\n\nTo the east, Luxembourg borders the German Bundesland of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and, to the south, it borders the French région of Lorraine. The Grand Duchy borders the Belgian Walloon Region, in particular the latter's provinces of Luxembourg and Liège, part of which comprises the German-speaking Community of Belgium, to the west and to the north respectively.\n\nThe northern third of the country is known as the 'Oesling', and forms part of the Ardennes. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the Kneiff near Wilwerdange,  which is the highest point, at 560 metres (1,837 ft). Other mountains are the 'Buurgplaaz' at 559 metres near Huldange and the 'Napoléonsgaard' at 554 metres near Rambrouch. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town (Wiltz) with a population of more than four thousand people.\n\nThe southern two-thirds of the country is called the \"Gutland\", and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse, and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\n\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.\n\nAccording to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Luxembourg is one of the world's best performers in environmental protection, ranking 4th out of 132 assessed countries  Luxembourg also ranks 6th among the top ten most livable cities in the world by Mercer's. \n\nClimate\n\nLuxembourg has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), marked by high precipitation, particularly in late summer. The summers are cool and winters mild. \n\nEconomy\n\nLuxembourg's stable and high-income market economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and a high level of innovation.  Unemployment is traditionally low, although it had risen to 6.1% by May 2012, due largely to the effect of the 2008 global financial crisis.  Consequently, Luxembourg's economy was forecast to have negligible growth in 2012.  In 2011, according to the IMF, Luxembourg was the second richest country in the world, with a per capita GDP on a purchasing-power parity (PPP) basis of $80,119.  Luxembourg is ranked 13th in the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom,  26th in the United Nations Human Development Index, and 4th in the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life index. \n\nExternal debt of Luxembourg is extremely high when external debt per capita or debt-to-GDP ratio is taken into consideration. External debt per capita (2014) is $3,696,467 and as a percentage of GDP it is 3443%, the world's highest by both measurements. \n\nThe industrial sector, which was dominated by steel until the 1960s, has since diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. During the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel production. Services, especially banking and finance, account for the majority of economic output. Luxembourg is the world's second largest investment fund centre (after the United States), the most important private banking centre in the eurozone and Europe's leading centre for reinsurance companies. Moreover, the Luxembourg government has aimed to attract internet start-ups, with Skype and Amazon being two of the many internet companies that have shifted their regional headquarters to Luxembourg.\n\nIn April 2009, concern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, as well as its reputation as a tax haven, led to its being added to a \"grey list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20. In response, the country soon after adopted OECD standards on exchange of information and was subsequently added into the category of \"jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard\".   In March 2010, the Sunday Telegraph reported that most of Kim Jong-Il's $4 billion in secret accounts is in Luxembourg banks.   Amazon.co.uk also benefits from Luxembourg tax loopholes by channeling substantial UK revenues as reported by  The Guardian  in April 2012.  Luxembourg ranked third on the Tax Justice Network's 2011 Financial Secrecy Index of the world's major tax havens, scoring only slightly behind the Cayman Islands.  In 2013, Luxembourg is ranked as the 2nd safest tax haven in the world, behind Switzerland.\n\nAgriculture is based on small, family-owned farms.\n\nLuxembourg has especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the Netherlands (see Benelux), and as a member of the EU it enjoys the advantages of the open European market.\n\nWith $171 billion in May 2015, the country ranks eleventh in the world in holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.  The ranking is however imperfect as some foreign owners entrust the safekeeping of their securities to institutions that are neither in the United States nor in the owner's country of residence. \n\nTransport\n\nLuxembourg has efficient road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with 147 km of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station and a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport was opened some years ago. There are plans to introduce trams in the capital and light-rail lines in adjacent areas within the next few years.\n\nThe number of cars per 1000 persons amount to 680.1 in Luxembourg — lower than all but two states, namely the Principality of Monaco and the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. \n\nCommunications\n\nThe telecommunications industry in Luxembourg is liberalised and the electronic communications networks are significantly developed. Competition between the different operators is guaranteed by the legislative framework Paquet Telecom  of the Government of 2011 which transposes the European Telecom Directives into Luxembourgean law. This encourages the investment in networks and services. The regulator ILR – Institut Luxembourgeois de Régulation  ensures the compliance to these legal rules.\n\nLuxembourg has modern and widely deployed optical fiber and cable networks throughout the country. In 2010, the Luxembourg Government launched its National strategy for very high-speed networks with the aim to become a global leader in terms of very high-speed broadband by achieving full 1 Gbit/s coverage of the country by 2020.  In 2011, Luxembourg had an NGA coverage of 75%.  In April 2013, Luxembourg featured the 6th highest download speed worldwide and the 2nd highest in Europe: 32,46 Mbit/s.  The country's location in Central Europe, stable economy and low taxes favour the telecommunication industry.   \n\nIt ranks 2nd in the world in the development of the Information and Communication Technologies in the ITU ICT Development Index and 8th in the Global Broadband Quality Study 2009 by the University of Oxford and the University of Oviedo.    \n\nLuxembourg is connected to all major European Internet Exchanges (AMS-IX Amsterdam,  DE-CIX Frankfurt,  LINX London),   datacenters and POPs through redundant optical networks.      In addition, the country is connected to the virtual meetme room services (vmmr)  of the international data hub operator Ancotel.  This enables Luxembourg to interconnect with all major telecommunication operators  and data carriers worldwide. The interconnection points are in Frankfurt, London, New York and Hong Kong. \n\nSeveral providers interconnect Luxembourg to the major European data hubs:\n* Teralink  (P&TLuxembourg, also called EPT Luxembourg: incumbent operator) \n* LuxConnect  (shareholder : Government) LuxConnect tested the 100G coherent transmission of data signals between Luxembourg and Amsterdam in June 2011. \n* Artelis/Cegecom  (alternative telecommunications provider in Luxembourg and Saarland)\n* Satellite connectivity – Teleports (SES),  Broadcasting Center Europe  and P&T Luxembourg Teleport.   \n\nLuxembourg is connected through an optical DWDM network, called Teralink  to several Tier 1 upstream providers like Level3 and Global Crossing. Teralink offers connectivities up to 100 Gbit/s. P&TLuxembourg established a coherent 100Gbit/s IP connection between Frankfurt and Luxembourg with live traffic in 2011.    \n\nThe Internet IPV6 protocol has been introduced to the country by Restena and P&T Luxembourg. \n\nLuxembourg has one Internet exchange point and one Carrier Ethernet Exchange point.\n* LU-CIX is Luxembourg's neutral and commercial Internet Exchange Point which was founded in 2009 by Cegecom, Datacentre Luxembourg, Global Media Systems, INEXIO, LuxConnect, P&T Luxembourg and Root eSolutions. It offers a short, fast and efficient route to the major European Internet networks.   In 2012, LIX, the neutral Internet exchange operated by the RESTENA Foundation, merged with LU-CIX.  In March 2013, LU-CIX launched the 'Central European Peering Hub' in order to provide the opportunity to its members to connect to other IXs' reseller programs, AMS-IX (Amsterdam), LINX (London), DE-CIX (Frankfurt) and France-IX (Paris), etc. \n* LIX is the Luxembourg Ethernet Exchange located in the Tier IV certified eBRC datacentre. \nThe online portal De Guichet  of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a single one-stop online shop for citizens and companies to undertake various administrative operations (procedures, online forms, downloadable forms and advice) by Internet. \n\nPSA Peugeot Citroën, with P&TLuxembourg as its partner, has introduced an integrated mobile telecommunication solution for the development of its telematic services in Europe.  \n\nData centres\n\nSome 20 data centres    are operating in Luxembourg. Six data centers are Tier IV Design certified: three of ebrc,  two of LuxConnect    and one of European Data Hub.  In a survey on nine international data centers carried out in December 2012 and January 2013 and measuring availability (up-time) and performance (delay by which the data from the requested website was received), the top three positions were held by Luxembourg data centers.  \n\nDemographics\n\nEthnicity\n\nThe people of Luxembourg are called Luxembourgers.  The immigrant population increased in the 20th century due to the arrival of immigrants from Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and Portugal, with the majority coming from the latter: in 2013 there were about 88,000 inhabitants with Portuguese nationality. \n\nThere is also a very small Romani (Gypsy) and Jewish population. Both of the two groups living in Luxembourg were affected by the Holocaust in the past and were expelled from Luxembourg.  \n\nSince the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, Luxembourg has seen many immigrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia. Annually, over 10,000 new immigrants arrive in Luxembourg, mostly from the EU states, as well as Eastern Europe. In 2000, there were 162,000 immigrants in Luxembourg, accounting for 37% of the total population. There were an estimated 5,000 Illegal immigrants in Luxembourg in 1999. \n\nLanguage\n\nThree languages are recognised as official in Luxembourg: French, German, and Luxembourgish, a Franconian language of the Moselle region that is also spoken in neighbouring parts of Belgium, France and Germany. Though Luxembourgish is part of the West Central German group of High German languages, more than 5,000 words in the language are of French origin.   The first printed sentences in Luxembourgish appeared in a weekly journal, the 'Luxemburger Wochenblatt', in the second edition on 14 April 1821.\n\nApart from being one of the three official languages, Luxembourgish is also considered the national language of the Grand Duchy; it is the mother tongue or \"language of the heart\" for nearly all Luxembourgers. \n\nEach of the three languages is used as the primary language in certain spheres. Luxembourgish is the language that Luxembourgers generally use to speak to each other, but it is not often used as the written language. Since the 1980s, an increasing number of novels have however been written in Luxembourgish. Most official (written) business is carried out in French. German is usually the first language taught in school and is the language of much of the media and of the church. \n\nLuxembourg's education system is trilingual: the first years of primary school are in Luxembourgish, before changing to German; while in secondary school, the language of instruction changes to French.  Proficiency in all three languages is required for graduation from secondary school, but half the students leave school without a certified qualification, with the children of immigrants being particularly disadvantaged. \n\nIn addition to the three official languages, English is taught in the compulsory schooling and much of the population of Luxembourg can speak English, especially in Luxembourg City. Portuguese, the language of the largest immigrant community, is also spoken by large parts of the population, but by relatively few from outside their community. \n\nFrench is the preferred language of the government. Official legislation must be conducted in French.\n\nReligion\n\nLuxembourg is a secular state, but the state recognises certain religions as officially mandated religions. This gives the state a hand in religious administration and appointment of clergy, in exchange for which the state pays certain running costs and wages. Currently, religions covered by such arrangements are Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Greek Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Russian Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, Mennonitism and Islam. \n\nSince 1980 it has been illegal for the government to collect statistics on religious beliefs or practices.  An estimation by the CIA Factbook for the year 2000 is that 87% of Luxembourgers are Catholic, including the royal family, the remaining 13% being made up of Muslims, Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, and those of other or no religion.  According to a 2010 Pew Research Center study 70.4% are Christian, 2.3% Muslim, 26.8% unaffiliated and 0.5% other religions. \n\nAccording to a 2005 Eurobarometer poll,[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf Eurobarometer on Social Values, Science and technology 2005] – page 11 44% of Luxembourg citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", whereas 28% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 22% that \"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force\".\n\nEducation\n\nThe University of Luxembourg is the only university in the country.\n\nHealth\n\nLuxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita.  However, the large proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighbouring countries contributes to the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg population. \n\nCulture\n\nLuxembourg has been overshadowed by the culture of its neighbours. It retains a number of folk traditions, having been for much of its history a profoundly rural country. There are several notable museums, located mostly in the capital. These include the National Museum of History and Art (NMHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, and the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam). The National Museum of Military History (MNHM) in Diekirch is especially known for its representations of the Battle of the Bulge. The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. \n\nThe country has produced some internationally-known artists, including the painters Théo Kerg, Joseph Kutter and Michel Majerus, and photographer Edward Steichen, whose The Family of Man exhibition has been placed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register, and is now permanently housed in Clervaux. Movie star Loretta Young was of Luxembourgish descent.\n\nLuxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, the European Capital of Culture  was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders physically, psychologically, artistically and emotionally.\n\nLuxembourg was represented at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China, from 1 May to 31 October 2010 with its own pavilion.   The pavilion was based on the transliteration of the word Luxembourg into Chinese, \"Lu Sen Bao\", which means \"Forest and Fortress\". It represented Luxembourg as the \"Green Heart in Europe\". \n\nSports\n\nUnlike most countries in Europe, sport in Luxembourg is not concentrated upon a particular national sport, but encompasses a number of sports, both team and individual. Despite the lack of a central sporting focus, over 100,000 people in Luxembourg, out of a total population of only 512,353, are licensed members of one sports federation or another.  The largest sports venue in the country is d'Coque, an indoor arena and Olympic swimming pool in Kirchberg, north-eastern Luxembourg City, which has a capacity of 8,300. The arena is used for basketball, handball, gymnastics, and volleyball, including the final of the 2007 Women's European Volleyball Championship. The national stadium (also the country's largest) is the Stade Josy Barthel, in western Luxembourg City; named after the country's only official Olympic gold medallist, the stadium has a capacity of 8,054.\n\nNotable sportspeople include (see also List of Luxembourgish Sportspeople of the Year):\n* Alpine skier Marc Girardelli, World Cup overall champion five times between 1985 and 1993\n* Cyclists Nicolas Frantz, winner of the 1927 and 1928 Tours de France; Charly Gaul, winner of the 1956 and 1959 Giro d'Italia and of the 1958 Tour de France; Elsy Jacobs, first ever women's Road World Champion in 1958; and Andy Schleck, winner of the 2010 Tour de France\n* Middle-distance runner Josy Barthel, winner of the men's 1500 metres at the 1952 Summer Olympics\n* 1961 world water skiing champion Sylvie Hülsemann\n\nCuisine\n\nLuxembourg cuisine reflects its position on the border between the Latin and Germanic worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighboring France and Germany. More recently, it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.\n\nMost native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in the country's folk dishes the same as in neighboring Germany.\n\nFile:JuddMatGaardebounen Beer.JPG|Judd mat Gaardebounen served with boiled potatoes and Diekirch beer\nFile:Bouneschlupp16.jpg|Bouneschlupp is considered to be a Luxemburgish national dish\nFile:Träipen.jpg|Träipen, sometimes treipen, is the Luxembourg variant of black pudding\n\nMedia\n\nThe main languages of media in Luxembourg are French and German. The newspaper with the largest circulation is the German-language daily Luxemburger Wort. \nIn addition there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES    is conducted in French.\n\nLuxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations (Radio Luxembourg and RTL Group). It is also the uplink home of SES, carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.\n\nDue to a 1988 law that established a special tax scheme for audiovisual investment, the film and co-production in Luxembourg has grown steadily.  There are some 30 registered production companies in Luxembourg.  \n\nLuxembourg won an Oscar in 2014 in the Animated Short Films category with Mr Hublot.",
                "Belgium (; ; ; ), officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe.  It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of 30528 km2 and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.\n\nHistorically, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (along with parts of Northern France and Western Germany) were known as the Low Countries; it once covered a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states. The region was called Belgica in Latin, after the Roman province of Gallia Belgica. From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century, the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the Belgian Revolution in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the Netherlands, the area of Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers, causing it to be dubbed the \"Battlefield of Europe,\"—The book reviewer, Haß, attributes the expression in English to James Howell in 1640. Howell's original phrase \"the cockpit of Christendom\" became modified afterwards, as shown by:*—and as such coined for Belgium:* \n\n(See also The Nuttall Encyclopaedia)\na reputation strengthened by both world wars.\n\nToday, Belgium is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. It is divided into three regions and three communities, that exist next to each other. Its two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia. The Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual, is a mostly French-speaking enclave within the Flemish Region.*\n*\n*\n*\nA German-speaking Community exists in eastern Wallonia.  \nBelgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance, made up of six different governments.\n\nUpon its independence, Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolution  \nand, during the course of the 20th century, possessed a number of colonies in Africa. The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens  fueled by differences in language and culture and the unequal economic development of Flanders and Wallonia. This continuing antagonism has led to several far-reaching reforms, resulting in a transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993. Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups remain, if not increased; there is significant separatism particularly among the Flemish; controversial language laws exist such as the municipalities with language facilities; and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the June 2010 federal election, a world record.  Belgium is a founding member of the European Union, Eurozone, NATO, OECD and WTO, and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union. Its capital, Brussels, hosts several of the EU's official seats as well as the headquarters of many major international organizations such as NATO.Belgium is also a member of, or affiliated to, many international organizations, including ACCT, AfDB, AsDB, Australia Group, Benelux, BIS, CCC, CE, CERN, EAPC, EBRD, EIB, EMU, ESA, EU, FAO, G-10, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICRM, IDA, IDB, IEA, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, IHO, ILO, IMF, IMO, IMSO, Intelsat, Interpol, IOC, IOM, ISO, ITU, MONUC (observers), NATO, NEA, NSG, OAS (observer), OECD, OPCW, OSCE, PCA, UN, UNCTAD, UNECE, UNESCO, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNMIK, UNMOGIP, UNRWA, UNTSO, UPU, WADB (non-regional), WEU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WTrO, ZC. Belgium is also a part of the Schengen Area. Belgium is a developed country, with an advanced high-income economy and is categorized as \"very high\" in the Human Development Index.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name 'Belgium' is derived from Gallia Belgica, a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul that before Roman invasion in 100 BC, was inhabited by the Belgae, a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples. \nA gradual immigration by Germanic Frankish tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the Merovingian kings. A gradual shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to evolve into the Carolingian Empire.Ib. e-book (2004) NetLibrary, Boulder, Colorado, United States, ISBN 0-8204-7283-2 [Also print edition ([http://isbndb.com/d/book/belgium_a_history.html ISBNDB.com] 2004-06-30) or ([http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?vID\n67647&vLangE&vHR\n1&vUR3&vUUR\n4&vNoHB=True Peterlang.com] 2005), ISBN 0-8204-7647-1]\n\nThe Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the region into Middle and West Francia and therefore into a set of more or less independent fiefdoms which, during the Middle Ages, were vassals either of the King of France or of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nMany of these fiefdoms were united in the Burgundian Netherlands of the 14th and 15th centuries. \nEmperor Charles V extended the personal union of the Seventeen Provinces in the 1540s, making it far more than a personal union by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 and increased his influence over the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. \n\nThe Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern United Provinces (Belgica Foederata in Latin, the \"Federated Netherlands\") and the Southern Netherlands (Belgica Regia, the \"Royal Netherlands\"). The latter were ruled successively by the Spanish (Spanish Netherlands) and the Austrian Habsburgs (Austrian Netherlands) and comprised most of modern Belgium. This was the theatre of most Franco-Spanish and Franco-Austrian wars during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nFollowing the campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars, the Low Countries—including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule, such as the Prince-Bishopric of Liège—were annexed by the French First Republic, ending Austrian rule in the region. The reunification of the Low Countries as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands occurred at the dissolution of the First French Empire in 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon.\n\nIn 1830, the Belgian Revolution led to the separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois, officially French-speaking and neutral, independent Belgium under a provisional government and a national congress.\n \nSince the installation of Leopold I as king on  1831, now celebrated as Belgium's National Day, Belgium has been a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy, with a laicist constitution based on the Napoleonic code.  Although the franchise was initially restricted, universal suffrage for men was introduced after the general strike of 1893 (with plural voting until 1919) and for women in 1949.\n\nThe main political parties of the 19th century were the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party, with the Belgian Labour Party emerging towards the end of the 19th century. French was originally the single official language adopted by the nobility and the bourgeoisie. It progressively lost its overall importance as Dutch became recognized as well. This recognition became official in 1898 and in 1967 the parliament accepted a Dutch version of the Constitution. \n\nThe Berlin Conference of 1885 ceded control of the Congo Free State to King Leopold II as his private possession. From around 1900 there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population (millions of whom are thought to have died) under Leopold II, for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. Many Congolese were killed by Leopold's agents for failing to meet production quotas for ivory and rubber.  It is estimated that nearly 10 million were killed during the Leopold period. \nIn 1908 this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony, henceforth called the Belgian Congo. A Belgian commission in 1919 estimated that Congo's population was half what it was in 1879.  \n\nGermany invaded Belgium in August 1914 as part of the Schlieffen Plan to attack France and much of the Western Front fighting of World War I occurred in western parts of the country. The opening months of the war were known as the Rape of Belgium due to German excesses. Belgium assumed control of the German colonies of Ruanda-Urundi (modern-day Rwanda and Burundi) during the war, and in 1924 the League of Nations mandated them to Belgium. In the aftermath of the First World War, the Prussian districts of Eupen and Malmedy were annexed by Belgium in 1925, thereby causing the presence of a German-speaking minority.\n\nGerman forces again invaded the country in May 1940 and 40,690 Belgians, over half of them Jews, were killed during the subsequent occupation and The Holocaust. From September 1944 to February 1945 Belgium was liberated by the Allies. After World War II, a general strike forced King Leopold III, who many Belgians felt had collaborated with Germany during the war, to abdicate in 1951. The Belgian Congo gained independence in 1960 during the Congo Crisis;   Ruanda-Urundi followed with its independence two years later. Belgium joined NATO as a founding member and formed the Benelux group of nations with the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\nBelgium became one of the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and of the European Atomic Energy Community and European Economic Community, established in 1957. The latter has now become the European Union, for which Belgium hosts major administrations and institutions, including the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the European Parliament.\n\nGeography \n\nBelgium shares borders with France (), Germany (), Luxembourg () and the Netherlands (). Its total area, including surface water area, is 30,528 square kilometres; land area alone is 30,278 km2. It lies between latitudes 49°30 and 51°30 N, and longitudes 2°33 and 6°24 E. \n\nBelgium has three main geographical regions: the coastal plain in the north-west and the central plateau both belong to the Anglo-Belgian Basin; the Ardennes uplands in the south-east are part of the Hercynian orogenic belt. The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, Belgian Lorraine. \n\nThe coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and polders. Further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways, with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the Campine (Kempen). The thickly forested hills and plateaux of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small gorges. Extending westward into France, this area is eastwardly connected to the Eifel in Germany by the High Fens plateau, on which the Signal de Botrange forms the country's highest point at 694 m.  \n\nThe climate is maritime temperate with significant precipitation in all seasons (Köppen climate classification: Cfb), like most of northwest Europe.  The average temperature is lowest in January at 3 °C and highest in July at 18 °C. The average precipitation per month varies between 54 mm for February or April, to 78 mm for July.  Averages for the years 2000 to 2006 show daily temperature minimums of 7 °C and maximums of 14 °C and monthly rainfall of 74 mm; these are about 1 °C and nearly 10 millimetres above last century's normal values, respectively.\n\nPhytogeographically, Belgium is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom.  According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of Belgium belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests.  Because of its high population density, industrialization and its location in the centre of Western Europe, Belgium still faces some environmental problems. However, due to consistent efforts by the various levels of government in Belgium, the state of the environment in Belgium is gradually improving. This led to Belgium being ranked as one of the top 10 countries (9 out of 132) in terms of environmental protection trends, and to Belgium being ranked in 2012 as the 24th country out of 132 for environmental protection. Belgium moreover has one of Europe's highest waste recycling rates. In particular, the Flemish region of Belgium has the highest waste diversion rate in Europe. Almost 75% of the residential waste produced there is reused, recycled, or composted.\n\nProvinces \n\nThe territory of Belgium is divided into three Regions, two of which, the Flemish Region and Walloon Region, are in turn subdivided into provinces; the third Region, the Brussels Capital Region, is neither a province nor a part of a province.\n\nPolitics\n\nBelgium is a constitutional, popular monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy. The bicameral federal parliament is composed of a Senate and a Chamber of Representatives. The former is made up of 50 senators appointed by the parliaments of the communities and regions and 10 co-opted senators. Prior to 2014, most of the Senate's members were directly elected. The Chamber's 150 representatives are elected under a proportional voting system from 11 electoral districts. Belgium has compulsory voting and thus maintains one of the highest rates of voter turnout in the world.\n\nThe King (currently Philippe) is the head of state, though with limited prerogatives. He appoints ministers, including a Prime Minister, that have the confidence of the Chamber of Representatives to form the federal government. The Council of Ministers is composed of no more than fifteen members. With the possible exception of the Prime Minister, the Council of Ministers is composed of an equal number of Dutch-speaking members and French-speaking members.\nThe judicial system is based on civil law and originates from the Napoleonic code. The Court of Cassation is the court of last resort, with the Court of Appeal one level below. \n\nPolitical culture\n\nBelgium's political institutions are complex; most political power is organized around the need to represent the main cultural communities. \nSince about 1970, the significant national Belgian political parties have split into distinct components that mainly represent the political and linguistic interests of these communities.\nThe major parties in each community, though close to the political centre, belong to three main groups: Christian Democrats, Liberals, and Social Democrats. \nFurther notable parties came into being well after the middle of last century, mainly around linguistic, nationalist, or environmental themes and recently smaller ones of some specific liberal nature.\n\nA string of Christian Democrat coalition governments from 1958 was broken in 1999 after the first dioxin crisis, a major food contamination scandal.    A \"rainbow coalition\" emerged from six parties: the Flemish and the French-speaking Liberals, Social Democrats and Greens.   Later, a \"purple coalition\" of Liberals and Social Democrats formed after the Greens lost most of their seats in the 2003 election.\n\nThe government led by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt from 1999 to 2007 achieved a balanced budget, some tax reforms, a labour-market reform, scheduled nuclear phase-out and instigated legislation allowing more stringent war crime and more lenient soft drug usage prosecution. Restrictions on withholding euthanasia were reduced and same-sex marriage legalized. The government promoted active diplomacy in Africa  and opposed the invasion of Iraq. \n\nVerhofstadt's coalition fared badly in the June 2007 elections. For more than a year, the country experienced a political crisis.  This crisis was such that many observers speculated on a possible partition of Belgium. From  2007 until  2008 the temporary Verhofstadt III Government was in office. This coalition of the Flemish and Francophone Christian Democrats, the Flemish and Francophone Liberals together with the Francophone Social Democrats was an interim government until  2008. \n\nOn that day a new government, led by Flemish Christian Democrat Yves Leterme, the actual winner of the federal elections of , was sworn in by the king. On  2008 Leterme announced the resignation of the cabinet to the king, as no progress in constitutional reforms had been made.\nIn December 2008 he once more offered his resignation to the king after a crisis surrounding the sale of Fortis to BNP Paribas.  At this juncture, his resignation was accepted and Christian Democratic and Flemish Herman Van Rompuy was sworn in as Prime Minister on  2008. \n\nAfter Herman Van Rompuy was designated the first permanent President of the European Council on  2009, he offered the resignation of his government to King Albert II on  2009. A few hours later, the new government under Prime Minister Yves Leterme was sworn in. On  2010, Leterme again offered the resignation of his cabinet to the king  after one of the coalition partners, the OpenVLD, withdrew from the government, and on  2010 King Albert officially accepted the resignation. \n\nThe Parliamentary elections in Belgium on  2010 saw the Flemish nationalist N-VA become the largest party in Flanders, and the Socialist Party PS the largest party in Wallonia.  Until December 2011, Belgium was governed by Leterme's caretaker government awaiting the end of the deadlocked negotiations for formation of a new government. By 30 March 2011 this set a new world record for the elapsed time without an official government, previously held by war-torn Iraq.  Finally, in December 2011 the Di Rupo Government led by Walloon socialist Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo was sworn in.\n\nThe 2014 federal election (coinciding with the regional elections) resulted in a further electoral gain for the Flemish nationalist N-VA, although the incumbent coalition (composed of Flemish and French-speaking Social Democrats, Liberals, and Christian Democrats) maintains a solid majority in Parliament and in all electoral constituencies. On 22 July 2014, King Philippe nominated Charles Michel (MR) and Kris Peeters (CD&V) to lead the formation of a new federal cabinet composed of the Flemish parties N-VA, CD&V, Open Vld and the French-speaking MR, which resulted in the Michel Government. It is the first time N-VA is part of the federal cabinet, while the French-speaking side is represented only by the MR, which achieved a minority of the public votes in Wallonia.\n\nCommunities and regions\n\nFollowing a usage which can be traced back to the Burgundian and Habsburgian courts,  in the 19th century it was necessary to speak French to belong to the governing upper class, and those who could only speak Dutch were effectively second-class citizens.  Late that century, and continuing into the 20th century, Flemish movements evolved to counter this situation.Fitzmaurice (1996), p. 31.\n\nWhile the people in Southern Belgium spoke French or dialects of French, and most Brusselers adopted French as their first language, the Flemings refused to do so and succeeded progressively in making Dutch an equal language in the education system. Following World War II, Belgian politics became increasingly dominated by the autonomy of its two main linguistic communities. Intercommunal tensions rose and the constitution was amended to minimise the potential for conflict.\n\nBased on the four language areas defined in 1962–63 (the Dutch, bilingual, French and German language areas), consecutive revisions of the country's constitution in 1970, 1980, 1988 and 1993 established a unique form of a federal state with segregated political power into three levels:\n# The federal government, based in Brussels.\n# The three language communities:\n#* the Flemish Community (Dutch-speaking);\n#* the French Community (French-speaking);\n#* the German-speaking Community.\n# The three regions:\n#* the Flemish Region, subdivided into five provinces;\n#* the Walloon Region, subdivided into five provinces;\n#* the Brussels-Capital Region.\n\nThe constitutional language areas determine the official languages in their municipalities, as well as the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters.Fitzmaurice (1996), p. 121 Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments, when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980, Flemish politicians decided to merge both.Fitzmaurice (1996), p. 122. Thus the Flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters.The Constitution set out seven institutions each of which can have a parliament, government and administration. In fact there are only six such bodies because the Flemish Region merged into the Flemish Community. This single Flemish body thus exercises powers about Community matters in the bilingual area of Brussels-Capital and in the Dutch language area, while about Regional matters only in Flanders.\n\nThe overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region. Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the Constitutional Court of Belgium. The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.\n\nLocus of policy jurisdiction\n\nThe Federal State's authority includes justice, defence, federal police, social security, nuclear energy, monetary policy and public debt, and other aspects of public finances. State-owned companies include the Belgian Post Group and Belgian Railways. The Federal Government is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the European Union and NATO. It controls substantial parts of public health, home affairs and foreign affairs. The budget—without the debt—controlled by the federal government amounts to about 50% of the national fiscal income. The federal government employs around 12% of the civil servants. \n\nCommunities exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries, originally oriented towards the individuals of a Community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), education and the use of the relevant language. Extensions to personal matters less directly connected with language comprise health policy (curative and preventive medicine) and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, immigrant assistance services, and so on.).\n\nRegions have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory. These include economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit and foreign trade. They supervise the provinces, municipalities and intercommunal utility companies.\n\nIn several fields, the different levels each have their own say on specifics. With education, for instance, the autonomy of the Communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications, which remain federal matters. Each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers. The treaty-making power of the Regions' and Communities' Governments is the broadest of all the Federating units of all the Federations all over the world.\n\nForeign relations\n\nBecause of its location at the crossroads of Western Europe, Belgium has historically been the route of invading armies from its larger neighbours. With virtually defenceless borders, Belgium has traditionally sought to avoid domination by the more powerful nations which surround it through a policy of mediation. The Belgians have been strong advocates of European integration. Both the European Union and NATO are headquartered in Belgium.\n\nArmed forces\n\nThe Belgian Armed Forces have about 47,000 active troops. In 2010, Belgium's defence budget totaled €3.95 billion (representing 1.12% of its GDP).  They are organized into one unified structure which consists of four main components: Land Component, or the Army; Air Component, or the Air Force; Naval Component, or the Navy; Medical Component. The operational commands of the four components are subordinate to the Staff Department for Operations and Training of the Ministry of Defence, which is headed by the Assistant Chief of Staff Operations and Training, and to the Chief of Defence. \n\nThe effects of the Second World War made collective security a priority for Belgian foreign policy. In March 1948 Belgium signed the Treaty of Brussels, and then joined NATO in 1948. However the integration of the armed forces into NATO did not begin until after the Korean War.  The Belgians, along with the Luxembourg government, sent a detachment of battalion strength to fight in Korea known as the Belgian United Nations Command. This mission was the first in a long line of UN missions which the Belgians supported. Currently, the Belgian Naval Component is working closely together with the Dutch Navy under the command of the Admiral Benelux.\n\nEconomy \n\nBelgium's strongly globalized economy  and its transport infrastructure are integrated with the rest of Europe. Its location at the heart of a highly industrialized region helped make it the world's 15th largest trading nation in 2007.   The economy is characterized by a highly productive work force, high GNP and high exports per capita. Belgium's main imports are raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemicals, raw diamonds, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, transportation equipment, and oil products. Its main exports are machinery and equipment, chemicals, finished diamonds, metals and metal products, and foodstuffs.\n\nThe Belgian economy is heavily service-oriented and shows a dual nature: a dynamic Flemish economy and a Walloon economy that lags behind. The richest (per capita income) of Belgium's three regions is the Flemish Region, followed by the Walloon Region and lastly the Brussels-Capital Region. The ten municipalities with the highest reported income are: Laethem-Saint-Martin, Keerbergen, Lasne, Oud-Heverlee, Hove, De Pinte, Meise, Knokke-Heist, Bierbeek. One of the founding members of the European Union, Belgium strongly supports an open economy and the extension of the powers of EU institutions to integrate member economies. Since 1922, through the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union, Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market with customs and currency union. \n\nBelgium was the first continental European country to undergo the Industrial Revolution, in the early 19th century. Liège and Charleroi rapidly developed mining and steelmaking, which flourished until the mid-20th century in the Sambre and Meuse valley and made Belgium among one of the three most industrialized nations in the world from 1830 to 1910.   However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis, and the region experienced famine from 1846 to 1850.  \n\nAfter World War II, Ghent and Antwerp experienced a rapid expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries. The 1973 and 1979 oil crises sent the economy into a recession; it was particularly prolonged in Wallonia, where the steel industry had become less competitive and experienced serious decline. In the 1980s and 1990s, the economic centre of the country continued to shift northwards and is now concentrated in the populous Flemish Diamond area. \n\nBy the end of the 1980s, Belgian macroeconomic policies had resulted in a cumulative government debt of about 120% of GDP. , the budget was balanced and public debt was equal to 90.30% of GDP.  In 2005 and 2006, real GDP growth rates of 1.5% and 3.0%, respectively, were slightly above the average for the Euro area. Unemployment rates of 8.4% in 2005 and 8.2% in 2006 were close to the area average. By , this had grown to 8.5% compared to an average rate of 9.6% for the European Union as a whole (EU 27).  From 1832 until 2002, Belgium's currency was the Belgian franc. Belgium switched to the euro in 2002, with the first sets of euro coins being minted in 1999. The standard Belgian euro coins designated for circulation show the portrait of the monarch (first King Albert II, since 2013 King Philippe).\n\nDespite an 18% decrease observed from 1970 to 1999, Belgium still had in 1999 the highest rail network density within the European Union with 113.8 km/1 000 km2. On the other hand, the same period of time, 1970–1999, has seen a huge growth (+56%) of the motorway network. In 1999, the density of km motorways per 1000 km2 and 1000 inhabitants amounted to 55.1 and 16.5 respectively and were significantly superior to the EU's means of 13.7 and 15.9.\n\nBelgium experiences some of the most congested traffic in Europe. In 2010, commuters to the cities of Brussels and Antwerp spent respectively 65 and 64 hours a year in traffic jams.  Like in most small European countries, more than 80% of the airways traffic is handled by a single airport, the Brussels Airport. The ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge share more than 80% of Belgian maritime traffic, Antwerp being the second European harbour with a gross weight of goods handled of 115 988 000 t in 2000 after a growth of 10.9% over the preceding five years. \n\nThere is a large economic gap between Flanders and Wallonia. Wallonia was historically wealthy compared to Flanders, mostly due to its heavy industries, but the decline of the steel industry post-World War II led to the region's rapid decline, whereas Flanders rose swiftly. Since then, Flanders has been prosperous, among the wealthiest regions in Europe, whereas Wallonia has been languishing. As of 2007, the unemployment rate of Wallonia is over double that of Flanders. The divide has played a key part in the tensions between the Flemish and Walloons in addition to the already-existing language divide. Pro-independence movements have gained high popularity in Flanders as a consequence. The separatist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party for instance is the largest party in Flanders. \n\nScience and technology \n\nContributions to the development of science and technology have appeared throughout the country's history. The 16th century Early Modern flourishing of Western Europe included cartographer Gerardus Mercator, anatomist Andreas Vesalius, herbalist Rembert Dodoens     and mathematician Simon Stevin among the most influential scientists. \n\nChemist Ernest Solvay  and engineer Zenobe Gramme (École Industrielle de Liège)  gave their names to the Solvay process and the Gramme dynamo, respectively, in the 1860s. Bakelite was developed in 1907–1909 by Leo Baekeland. Ernest Solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave its name to the Solvay Institute of Sociology, the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management and the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry which are now part of the Université libre de Bruxelles. In 1911, he started a series of conferences, the Solvay Conferences on Physics and Chemistry, which have had a deep impact on the evolution of quantum physics and chemistry.  A major contribution to fundamental science was also due to a Belgian, Monsignor Georges Lemaître (Catholic University of Leuven), who is credited with proposing the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe in 1927. \n\nThree Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine were awarded to Belgians: Jules Bordet (Université libre de Bruxelles) in 1919, Corneille Heymans (University of Ghent) in 1938 and Albert Claude (Université Libre de Bruxelles) together with Christian de Duve (Université Catholique de Louvain) in 1974. François Englert (Université Libre de Bruxelles) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013. Ilya Prigogine (Université Libre de Bruxelles) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977.  Two Belgian mathematicians have been awarded the Fields Medal: Pierre Deligne in 1978 and Jean Bourgain in 1994.  \n\nDemographics \n\n, the total population of Belgium according to its population register was 11,190,845. Almost all of the population is urban, at 97% in 2004.  The population density of Belgium is 365 per square kilometre (952 per square mile) as of March 2013. The most densely inhabited area is Flanders.  The Ardennes have the lowest density. , the Flemish Region had a population of 6,437,680, its most populous cities being Antwerp (511,771), Ghent (252,274) and Bruges (117,787). Wallonia had 3,585,214 with Charleroi (202,021), Liège (194,937) and Namur (110,447), its most populous cities. Brussels has 1,167,951 inhabitants in the Capital Region's 19 municipalities, three of which have over 100,000 residents.\n\n, nearly 92% of the population had Belgian citizenship,  and other European Union member citizens account for around 6%. The prevalent foreign nationals were Italian (171,918), French (125,061), Dutch (116,970), Moroccan (80,579), Portuguese (43,509), Spanish (42,765), Turkish (39,419) and German (37,621).   In 2007, there were 1.38 million foreign-born residents in Belgium, corresponding to 12.9% of the total population. Of these, 685,000 (6.4%) were born outside the EU and 695,000 (6.5%) were born in another EU Member State.  \n\nAt the beginning of 2012, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed around 25% of the total population i.e. 2.8 million new Belgians.  Of these new Belgians, 1,200,000 are of European ancestry and 1,350,000  are from non-Western countries (most of them from Morocco, Turkey, and the DR Congo). Since the modification of the Belgian nationality law in 1984 more than 1.3 million migrants have acquired Belgian citizenship. The largest group of immigrants and their descendants in Belgium are Moroccans, with more than 450,000 people. The Turks are the third largest group, and the second largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 220,000.  89.2% of inhabitants of Turkish origin have been naturalized, as have 88.4% of people of Moroccan background, 75.4% of Italians, 56.2% of the French and 47.8% of Dutch people.\n\nLanguages \n\nBelgium has three official languages: Dutch, French and German. A number of non-official minority languages are spoken as well.\nAs no census exists, there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium's three official languages or their dialects.  However, various criteria, including the language(s) of parents, of education, or the second-language status of foreign born, may provide suggested figures. An estimated 60% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often referred to as Flemish), and 40% of the population speaks French. French-speaking Belgians are often referred to as Walloons, although the French speakers in Brussels are not Walloons.Native speakers of Dutch living in Wallonia and of French in Flanders are relatively small minorities that furthermore largely balance one another, hence attributing all inhabitants of each unilingual area to the area's language can cause only insignificant inaccuracies (99% can speak the language). Dutch: Flanders' 6.079 million inhabitants and about 15% of Brussels' 1.019 million are 6.23 million or 59.3% of the 10.511 million inhabitants of Belgium (2006); German: 70,400 in the German-speaking Community (which has language facilities for its less than 5% French-speakers) and an estimated 20,000–25,000 speakers of German in the Walloon Region outside the geographical boundaries of their official Community, or 0.9%; French: in the latter area as well as mainly in the rest of Wallonia (3.414 − 0.093 \n 3.321 million) and 85% of the Brussels inhabitants (0.866 million) thus 4.187 million or 39.8%; together indeed 100%.\n\nTotal Dutch speakers are 6.23 million, concentrated in the northern Flanders region, while French speakers number 3.32 million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (or 85%) in the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region.Flemish Academic Eric Corijn (initiator of [http://www.charta91.be/ Charta 91]), at a colloquium regarding Brussels, on 2001-12-05, states that in Brussels 91% of the population speaks French at home, either alone or with another language, and about 20% speaks Dutch at home, either alone (9%) or with French (11%)—After ponderation, the repartition can be estimated at between 85 and 90% French-speaking, and the remaining are Dutch-speaking, corresponding to the estimations based on languages chosen in Brussels by citizens for their official documents (ID, driving licenses, weddings, birth, sex, and so on); all these statistics on language are also available at Belgian Department of Justice (for weddings, birth, sex), Department of Transport (for Driving licenses), Department of Interior (for IDs), because there are no means to know precisely the proportions since Belgium has abolished 'official' linguistic censuses, thus official documents on language choices can only be estimations. For a web source on this topic, see e.g. General online sources: Janssens, Rudi—Strictly, the capital is the municipality (City of) Brussels, though the Brussels-Capital Region might be intended because of its name and also its other municipalities housing institutions typical for a capital. The German-speaking Community is made up of 73,000 people in the east of the Walloon Region; around 10,000 German and 60,000 Belgian nationals are speakers of German. Roughly 23,000 more German speakers live in municipalities near the official Community.   \n\nBoth Belgian Dutch and Belgian French have minor differences in vocabulary and semantic nuances from the varieties spoken respectively in the Netherlands and France. Many Flemish people still speak dialects of Dutch in their local environment. Walloon, considered either as a dialect of French or a distinct Romance language,   is now only understood and spoken occasionally, mostly by elderly people. Walloon is the name collectively given to four French dialects spoken in Belgium. Wallonia's dialects, along with those of Picard,Among Belgium native German speakers many are familiar with the local dialect varieties of their region, that include dialects that spill over into neighboring Luxembourg and Germany. (Online version: [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name\nBE Sixteenth edition]) are not used in public life and have been replaced by French.\n\nA very small group with a fourth language can be found in Vresse-sur-Semois, one municipality where they speak Champenois, the local dialect in the Champagne area. The language is recognised by France and the Walloon part of Belgium.\n\nReligion\n\nSince the country's independence, Roman Catholicism, counterbalanced by strong freethought movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics.  However Belgium is largely a secular country as the laicist constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. During the reigns of Albert I and Baudouin, the monarchy had a reputation of deeply rooted Catholicism.\n\nRoman Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium's majority religion; being especially strong in Flanders. However, by 2009 Sunday church attendance was 5% for Belgium in total; 3% in Brussels,  and 5.4% in Flanders. Church attendance in 2009 in Belgium was roughly half of the Sunday church attendance in 1998 (11% for the total of Belgium in 1998).  Despite the drop in church attendance, Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Belgium's culture.\n\nAccording to the most recent Eurobarometer Poll 2010,  37% of Belgian citizens responded that they believe there is a God. 31% answered that they believe there is some sort of spirit or life-force. 27% answered that they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life-force. 5% did not respond.\n\nSymbolically and materially, the Roman Catholic Church remains in a favourable position. Belgium has three officially recognized religions: Christianity (Catholic, Protestantism, Orthodoxy and Anglicanism), Islam and Judaism. \n\nIn the early 2000s there were approximately 42,000 Jews in Belgium. The Jewish Community of Antwerp (numbering some 18,000) is one of the largest in Europe, and one of the last places in the world where Yiddish is the primary language of a large Jewish community (mirroring certain Orthodox and Hasidic communities in New York and Israel). In addition most Jewish children in Antwerp receive a Jewish education.  There are several Jewish newspapers and more than 45 active synagogues (30 of which are in Antwerp) in the country.\n\nA 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered to be a more religious region than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious and that 36% believed that God created the universe.  On the other hand, Wallonia has become one of Europe's most secular/least religious regions. Most of the French-speaking region's population does not consider religion an important part of their lives, and as much as 45% of the population identifies as irreligious. This is particularly the case in eastern Wallonia and areas along the French border.\n\nA 2008 estimate found that approximately 6% of the Belgian population (628,751 people) is Muslim.  Muslims constitute 23.6% of the population of Brussels, 4.9% of Wallonia and 5.1% of Flanders. The majority of Belgian Muslims live in the major cities, such as Antwerp, Brussels and Charleroi. The largest group of immigrants in Belgium are Moroccans, with 400,000 people. The Turks are the third largest group, and the second largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 220,000. \n\nAccording to new polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer found that Christianity is the largest religion in Belgium accounting 65% of Belgians. The question asked was \"Do you consider yourself to be...?\" With a card showing: Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Other Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu, Atheist, and Non-believer/Agnostic.  Space was given for Other (SPONTANEOUS) and DK. Jewish, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu did not reach the 1% threshold. Catholics are the largest Christian group in Belgium, accounting for 58% of Belgium citizens, while Protestants make up 2%, and Other Christian make up 5%. Non believer/agnostics account for 20%, atheists 7%, and Muslims 5%.\n\nHealth\n\nThe Belgians enjoy good health. According to 2012 estimates, the average life expectancy is 79.65 years. Since 1960, life expectancy has, in line with the European average, grown by two months per year. Death in Belgium is mainly due to heart and vascular disorders, neoplasms, disorders of the respiratory system and unnatural causes of death (accidents, suicide). Non-natural causes of death and cancer are the most common causes of death for females up to age 24 and males up to age 44.\n\nHealthcare in Belgium is financed through both social security contributions and taxation. Health insurance is compulsory. Health care is delivered by a mixed public and private system of independent medical practitioners and public, university and semi-private hospitals. Health care service are payable by the patient and reimbursed later by health insurance institutions, but for ineligible categories (of patients and services) so-called 3rd party payment systems exist. The Belgian health care system is supervised and financed by the federal government, the Flemish and Walloon Regional governments; and the German Community also has (indirect) oversight and responsibilities.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation is compulsory from 6 to 18 years of age for Belgians. Extracts:\n [https://books.google.com/books?idnskLDqh40dwC&pg\nPA97 p. 97],\n [https://books.google.com/books?idnskLDqh40dwC&pg\nPA105 p. 105] Among OECD countries in 2002, Belgium had the third highest proportion of 18- to 21-year-olds enrolled in postsecondary education, at 42%. Though an estimated 99% of the adult population is literate, concern is rising over functional illiteracy. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks Belgium's education as the 19th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average. Education being organized separately by each, the Flemish Community scores noticeably above the French and German-speaking Communities.\n\nMirroring the dual structure of the 19th-century Belgian political landscape, characterized by the Liberal and the Catholic parties, the educational system is segregated within a secular and a religious segment. The secular branch of schooling is controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, while religious, mainly Catholic branch education, is organized by religious authorities, although subsidized and supervised by the communities.\n\nCulture\n\nDespite its political and linguistic divisions, the region corresponding to today's Belgium has seen the flourishing of major artistic movements that have had tremendous influence on European art and culture. Nowadays, to a certain extent, cultural life is concentrated within each language Community, and a variety of barriers have made a shared cultural sphere less pronounced.   Since the 1970s, there are no bilingual universities or colleges in the country except the Royal Military Academy and the Antwerp Maritime Academy, no common media  and no single large cultural or scientific organization in which both main communities are represented. \n\nFine arts\n\nContributions to painting and architecture have been especially rich. The Mosan art, the Early Netherlandish,  the Flemish Renaissance and Baroque painting  and major examples of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architecture  are milestones in the history of art. While the 15th century's art in the Low Countries is dominated by the religious paintings of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, the 16th century is characterized by a broader panel of styles such as Peter Breughel's landscape paintings and Lambert Lombard's representation of the antique.  Though the Baroque style of Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck flourished in the early 17th century in the Southern Netherlands,  it gradually declined thereafter.  \n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries many original romantic, expressionist and surrealist Belgian painters emerged, including James Ensor and other artists belonging to the Les XX group, Constant Permeke, Paul Delvaux and René Magritte. The avant-garde CoBrA movement appeared in the 1950s, while the sculptor Panamarenko remains a remarkable figure in contemporary art.   Multidisciplinary artists Jan Fabre, Wim Delvoye and the painters Guy Huygens and Luc Tuymans are other internationally renowned figures on the contemporary art scene.\n\nBelgian contributions to architecture also continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, including the work of Victor Horta and Henry van de Velde, who were major initiators of the Art Nouveau style.  \n\nThe vocal music of the Franco-Flemish School developed in the southern part of the Low Countries and was an important contribution to Renaissance culture.  In the 19th and 20th centuries, there was an emergence of major violinists, such as Henri Vieuxtemps, Eugène Ysaÿe and Arthur Grumiaux, while Adolphe Sax invented the saxophone in 1846. The composer César Franck was born in Liège in 1822. Contemporary popular music in Belgium is also of repute. Jazz musician Toots Thielemans and singer Jacques Brel have achieved global fame. Nowadays, singer Stromae has been a musical revelation in Europe and beyond, having great success. In rock/pop music, Telex, Front 242, K's Choice, Hooverphonic, Zap Mama, Soulwax and dEUS are well known. In the heavy metal scene, bands like Machiavel, Channel Zero and Enthroned have a worldwide fan-base.Two comprehensive discussions of rock and pop music in Belgium since the 1950s:\n\nBelgium has produced several well-known authors, including the poets Emile Verhaeren, Robert Goffin and novelists Hendrik Conscience, Georges Simenon, Suzanne Lilar, Hugo Claus, Joseph Weterings and Amélie Nothomb. The poet and playwright Maurice Maeterlinck won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1911. The Adventures of Tintin by Hergé is the best known of Franco-Belgian comics, but many other major authors, including Peyo (The Smurfs), André Franquin (Gaston Lagaffe), Dupa (Cubitus), Morris (Lucky Luke), Greg (Achille Talon), Lambil (Les Tuniques Bleues), Edgar P. Jacobs and Willy Vandersteen brought the Belgian cartoon strip industry a worldwide fame. \n\nBelgian cinema has brought a number of mainly Flemish novels to life on-screen.Notable Belgian films based on works by Flemish authors include: De Witte (author Ernest Claes) movie by Jan Vanderheyden and Edith Kiel in 1934, remake as De Witte van Sichem directed by Robbe De Hert in 1980; De man die zijn haar kort liet knippen (Johan Daisne) André Delvaux 1965; Mira ('De teleurgang van de Waterhoek' by Stijn Streuvels) Fons Rademakers 1971; Malpertuis (aka The Legend of Doom House) (Jean Ray [pen name of Flemish author who mainly wrote in French, or as John Flanders in Dutch]) Harry Kümel 1971; De loteling (Hendrik Conscience) Roland Verhavert 1974; Dood van een non (Maria Rosseels) Paul Collet and Pierre Drouot 1975; Pallieter (Felix Timmermans) Roland Verhavert 1976; De komst van Joachim Stiller (Hubert Lampo) Harry Kümel 1976; De Leeuw van Vlaanderen (Hendrik Conscience) Hugo Claus (a famous author himself) 1985; Daens ('Pieter Daens' by Louis Paul Boon) Stijn Coninx 1992; see also [//web.archive.org/web/20070514023803/http://www.ledoux.be/nl/dvdmain.htm Filmarchief les DVD!s de la cinémathèque] (in Dutch). Retrieved on  2007. Other Belgian directors include André Delvaux, Stijn Coninx, Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne; well-known actors include Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jan Decleir and Marie Gillain; and successful films include Bullhead, Man Bites Dog and The Alzheimer Affair.  In the 1980s, Antwerp's Royal Academy of Fine Arts produced important fashion trendsetters, known as the Antwerp Six. \n\nFolklore\n\nFolklore plays a major role in Belgium's cultural life: the country has a comparatively high number of processions, cavalcades, parades, 'ommegangs' and 'ducasses',The Dutch word 'ommegang' is here used in the sense of an entirely or mainly non-religious procession, or the non-religious part thereof—see also its article on the Dutch-language Wikipedia; the Processional Giants of Brussels, Dendermonde and Mechelen mentioned in this paragraph are part of each city's 'ommegang'. The French word 'ducasse' refers also to a procession; the mentioned Processional Giants of Ath and Mons are part of each city's 'ducasse'. 'kermesse' and other local festivals, nearly always with an originally religious or mythological background. The Carnival of Binche with its famous Gilles and the 'Processional Giants and Dragons' of Ath, Brussels, Dendermonde, Mechelen and Mons are recognized by UNESCO as Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. \n\nOther examples are the Carnival of Aalst; the still very religious processions of the Holy Blood in Bruges, Virga Jesse Basilica in Hasselt and Basilica of Our Lady of Hanswijk in Mechelen;  festival in Liège; and the Walloon festival in Namur. Originated in 1832 and revived in the 1960s, the Gentse Feesten have become a modern tradition. A major non-official holiday is the Saint Nicholas Day, a festivity for children and, in Liège, for students. \n\nCuisine\n\nMany highly ranked Belgian restaurants can be found in the most influential restaurant guides, such as the Michelin Guide.  Belgium is famous for beer, chocolate, waffles and french fries with mayonnaise. Contrary to their name, french fries are claimed to have originated in Belgium, although their exact place of origin is uncertain. The national dishes are \"steak and fries with salad\", and \"mussels with fries\".   \n\nBrands of Belgian chocolate and pralines, like Côte d'Or, Neuhaus, Leonidas and Godiva are famous, as well as independent producers such as Burie and Del Rey in Antwerp and Mary's in Brussels.  Belgium produces over 1100 varieties of beer.   The Trappist beer of the Abbey of Westvleteren has repeatedly been rated the world's best beer.   \nThe biggest brewer in the world by volume is Anheuser-Busch InBev, based in Leuven. \n\nSports\n\nSince the 1970s, sports clubs and federations are organized separately within each language community.  Association football is the most popular sport in both parts of Belgium; also very popular are cycling, tennis, swimming, judo  and basketball. \n\nBelgians hold the most Tour de France victories of any country except France. They have also the most victories on the UCI Road World Championships. Philippe Gilbert is the 2012 world champion. Another modern well-known Belgian cyclist is Tom Boonen. With five victories in the Tour de France and numerous other cycling records, Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx is regarded as one of the greatest cyclists of all time.  Jean-Marie Pfaff, a former Belgian goalkeeper, is considered one of the greatest in the history of association football. \n\nBelgium hosted the 1972 European Football Championships, and co-hosted the 2000 European Championships with the Netherlands. The Belgium national football team reached first place in the FIFA World Rankings for the first time in November 2015. \n\nKim Clijsters and Justine Henin both were Player of the Year in the Women's Tennis Association as they were ranked the number one female tennis player.\nThe Spa-Francorchamps motor-racing circuit hosts the Formula One World Championship Belgian Grand Prix. The Belgian driver, Jacky Ickx, won eight Grands Prix and six 24 Hours of Le Mans and finished twice as runner-up in the Formula One World Championship. Belgium also has a strong reputation in motocross.  Sporting events annually held in Belgium include the Memorial Van Damme athletics competition, the Belgian Grand Prix Formula One, and a number of classic cycle races such as the Tour of Flanders and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The 1920 Summer Olympics were held in Antwerp. The 1977 European Basketball Championship was held in Liège and Ostend.",
                "France (French:), officially the French Republic (), is a sovereign state comprising territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. France spans 643801 km2 and has a total population of 66.7 million. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. During the Iron Age, what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls, a Celtic people. The area was annexed in 51 BC by Rome, which held Gaul until 486, when the Germanic Franks conquered the region and formed the Kingdom of France. \n\nFrance emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages, with its victory in the Hundred Years' War (1337 to 1453) strengthening state-building and political centralization. During the Renaissance, French culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established, which by the 20th century would be the second largest in the world.  The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). France became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power under Louis XIV.  In the late 18th century, the French Revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy, established one of modern history's earliest republics, and saw the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. \n\nIn the 19th century Napoleon took power and established the First French Empire, whose subsequent Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of continental Europe. Following the collapse of the Empire, France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the French Third Republic in 1870. France was a major participant in the First World War, from which it emerged victorious, and was one of the Allied Powers in the Second World War, but came under occupation by the Axis Powers in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in 1958 and remains to this day. Algeria and the colonies in Indochina became independent in the 1950s after long, bloody wars. Nearly all the other colonies became independent in the 1960s with minimal controversy and typically retained close economic and military connections with France. \n\nFrance has long been a global center of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts Europe's third-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites (after Italy and Spain) and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually, the most of any country in the world.  France is a developed country with the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP  and ninth-largest by purchasing power parity.  In terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world.  France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, and human development.   France remains a great power in the world,  being a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and a founding and leading member state of the European Union (EU). It is also a member of the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie.\n\nEtymology\n\nOriginally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name \"France\" comes from the Latin ', or \"country of the Franks\".  Modern France is still named today Francia in Italian and Spanish, Frankreich in German and Frankrijk in Dutch, all of which have the same historical meaning.\n\nThere are various theories as to the origin of the name Frank. Following the precedents of Edward Gibbon and Jacob Grimm,  the name of the Franks has been linked with the word frank (free) in English.  It has been suggested that the meaning of \"free\" was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation.  Another theory is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word frankon, which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca.  However, it has been determined that these weapons were named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around. \n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory (before the 6th century BC)\n\nThe oldest traces of human life in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.  Humans were then confronted by a harsh and variable climate, marked by several glacial eras. Early homonids led a nomadic hunter-gatherer life. France has a large number of decorated caves from the upper Paleolithic era, including one of the most famous and best preserved: Lascaux (approximately 18,000 BC).\n\nAt the end of the last glacial period (10,000 BC), the climate became milder; from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary. After strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium, initially working gold, copper and bronze, and later iron.  France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic period, including the exceptionally dense Carnac stones site (approximately 3,300 BC).\n\nAntiquity (6th century BC–5th century AD)\n\nIn 600 BC, Ionian Greeks, originating from Phocaea, founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This makes it France's oldest city.   At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated parts of the current territory of France, and this occupation spread to the rest of France between the 5th and 3rd century BC. \n\nThe concept of Gaul emerged at that time; it corresponds to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the Rhine, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean. The borders of modern France are roughly the same as those of ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by Celtic Gauls. Gaul was then a prosperous country, of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman influences.\n\nAround 390 BC the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Italy through the Alps, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome. The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome. But the Romans and the Gauls would remain adversaries for the next several centuries, and the Gauls would continue to be a threat in Italia.\n\nAround 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region Provincia Nostra (\"Our Province\"), which over time evolved into the name Provence in French.  Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC.  Gaul was divided by Augustus into Roman provinces.Carpentier et al. 2000, pp. 53–55 Many cities were founded during the Gallo-Roman period, including Lugdunum (present-day Lyon), which is considered the capital of the Gauls. These cities were built in traditional Roman style, with a forum, a theatre, a circus, an amphitheatre and thermal baths. The Gauls mixed with Roman settlers and eventually adopted Roman culture and Roman speech (Latin, from which the French language evolved). The Roman polytheism merged with the Gallic paganism into the same syncretism.\n\nFrom the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians.Carpentier et al. 2000, pp. 76–77 Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.  In 312, the emperor Constantin I converted to Christianity. Subsequently, Christians, who had been persecuted until then, increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire.  But, from the beginning of the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed,  and Germanic tribes, such as the Vandals, Suebi and Alans crossed the Rhine and settled in Gaul, Spain and other parts of the collapsing Roman Empire. \n\nEarly Middle Ages (5th century–10th century)\n\nAt the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region.\n The pagan Franks, from whom the ancient name of \"Francie\" was derived, originally settled the north part of Gaul, but under Clovis I conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central Gaul. In 498, Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title \"Eldest daughter of the Church\" (') by the papacy,  and French kings would be called \"the Most Christian Kings of France\" (').\n\nThe Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed Francia (\"Land of the Franks\"). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages, except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis's: Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Islamic invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe.\n\nProclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church,  Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son, Louis I (emperor 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald. West Francia approximated the area occupied by, and was the precursor, to modern France. \n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by Viking invasions, France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added \"King of England\" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions.\n\nLate Middle Ages (10th century–15th century)\n\nThe Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned King of the Franks.  His descendantsthe Capetians, the House of Valois, and the House of Bourbonprogressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the Kingdom of France, which was fully declared in 1190 by Philip II Augustus. The French kings played a prominent role in most Crusades in order to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as Franj caring little whether they really came from France.  The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the lingua franca (\"Frankish language\") of the Crusader states. French knights also comprised the majority in both the Hospital and the Temple orders. The latter, in particular, held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, until Philip IV annihilated the order in 1307. The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the kingdom of France.  Later kings expanded their domain to cover over half of modern continental France, including most of the north, centre and west of France. Meanwhile, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners.\n\nCharles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.  Under the rules of the Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line. Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, a cousin of Charles, rather than through the female line to Charles' nephew, Edward, who would soon become Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power. Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England and in 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the Hundred Years' War.  The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but French landholdings of the English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, strong French counterattacks won back English continental territories. Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death; half of the 17 million population of France died.  \n\nEarly modern period (15th century–1789)\n\nThe French Renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardization of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as the Italian Wars, between the Kingdom of France and the powerful Holy Roman Empire. French explorers, such as Jacques Cartier or Samuel de Champlain, claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the First French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.  The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots.\n\nUnder Louis XIII, the energetic Cardinal Richelieu reinforced the centralization of the state, royal power and French dominance in Europe, foreshadowing the reign of Louis XIV. During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France, which was at that time at war with Spain. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal power in France.\n\nThe monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged. Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power. France became the most populous country in Europe and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.  France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Louis XIV also revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile.\n\nUnder Louis XV, Louis XIV's grandson, France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War, which ended in 1763. Its European territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions  as well as the debauchery of his court discredited the monarchy and arguably led to the French Revolution 15 years after his death.  \n\nLouis XVI, Louis XV's grandson, actively supported the Americans, who were seeking their independence from Great Britain (realized in the Treaty of Paris (1783)). The financial crisis that followed France's involvement in the American Revolutionary War was one of many contributing factors to the French Revolution. Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the discovery of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the French Revolution.\n\nModern period (1789–1914)\n\nFacing financial troubles, Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General (gathering the three Estates of the realm) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estate formed into a National Assembly, signaling the outbreak of the French Revolution. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents stormed the Bastille on 14 July 1789, a date which would become France's National Day.\n\nThe absolute monarchy was subsequently replaced by a constitutional monarchy. Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms \"the natural and imprescriptible rights of man\" to \"liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression\". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth. While Louis XVI, as a constitutional king, enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.\n\nEuropean monarchies gathered against the new régime, to restore the French absolute monarchy. The foreign threat exacerbated France's political turmoil and deepened the sense of urgency among the various factions and war was declared against Austria on 20 April 1792. Mob violence occurred during the insurrection of 10 August 1792  and the following month.  As a result of this violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy, the Republic was proclaimed on 22 September 1792.\n\nLouis XVI was convicted of treason and guillotined in 1793. Facing increasing pressure from European monarchies, internal guerrilla wars and counterrevolutions (such as the War in the Vendée or the Chouannerie), the young Republic fell into the Reign of Terror. Between 1793 and 1794, between 16,000 and 40,000 people were executed. In Western France, the civil war between the Bleus (\"Blues\", supporters of the Revolution) and the Blancs (\"Whites\", supporters of the Monarchy) lasted from 1793 to 1796 and led to the loss of between 200,000 and 450,000 lives.   Both foreign armies and French counter-revolutionaries were crushed and the French Republic survived. Furthermore, it extended greatly its boundaries and established \"Sister Republics\" in the surrounding countries. As the threat of a foreign invasion receded and France became mostly pacified, the Thermidorian Reaction put an end to Robespierre's rule and to the Terror. The abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage, enacted during this radical phase of the revolution, were cancelled by subsequent governments.\n\nAfter a short-lived governmental scheme, Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814/1815). As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt or Austerlitz. He redrew the European political map, while members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.  These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the Metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. After the catastrophic Russian campaign, and the ensuing uprising of European monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated and the Bourbon monarchy restored. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nAfter his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the monarchy was re-established (1815–1830), with new constitutional limitations. The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy, which lasted until 1848, when the French Second Republic was proclaimed, in the wake of the European Revolutions of 1848. The abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage, both briefly enacted during the French Revolution were re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the president of the French Republic, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, in Mexico and Italy which resulted in the annexation of the duchy of Savoy and the county of Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia.  Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the Third Republic. France had colonial possessions, in various forms, since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries, its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the British Empire. Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under French sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land. Known as the Belle Époque, the turn of the century was a period characterized by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, state secularism was officially established.\n\nContemporary period (1914–present)\n\nFrance was a member of the Triple Entente when World War I broke out. A small part of Northern France was occupied, but France and its allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at a tremendous human and material cost. World War I left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population.  Between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912–1915 were killed.  The interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government, etc...).\n\nIn 1940 France was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany. Metropolitan France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north and Vichy France, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, in the south, while Free France, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London.  From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews,    were deported to death camps and concentration camps in Germany and Poland.  On 6 June 1944 the Allies invaded Normandy and in August they invaded Provence. Over the following year the Allies and the French Resistance emerged victorious over the Axis powers and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It also made several important reforms (suffrage extended to women, creation of a social security system).\n\nThe GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the Fourth Republic, which saw spectacular economic growth (les Trente Glorieuses). France was one of the founding members of NATO (1949). France attempted to regain control of French Indochina but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954 at the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria. Torture and illegal executions were perpetrated by both sides and the debate over whether or not to keep control of Algeria, then home to over one million European settlers,  wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war. \n\nIn 1958, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened Presidency.  In the latter role, Charles de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the war. The Algerian War was concluded with the Évian Accords in 1962 that led to Algerian independence. A vestige of the colonial empire are the French overseas departments and territories.\n\nIn the context of the Cold War, de Gaulle pursued a policy of \"national independence\" towards the Western and Eastern blocs. To this end, he withdrew from NATO's military integrated command, he launched a nuclear development program and made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations in order to create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring a Europe of sovereign Nations. In the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968, the revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact. In France, it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (as the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle who resigned shortly after.\n\nIn the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed economies in the World, but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational European Union, notably by signing the Maastricht Treaty (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the Eurozone in 1999, and signing the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.  France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO sponsored wars. \n\nSince the 19th century France has received many immigrants. These have been mostly male foreign workers from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed.  During the 1970s France faced economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the Maghreb) to permanently settle in France with their families and to acquire French citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims (especially in the larger cities) living in subsidized public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates.  Simultaneously France renounced the assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French traditional values and cultural norms. They were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate. \n\nSince the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings, France has been sporadically targeted by Islamist organizations, notably the Charlie Hebdo attack in January which provoked the largest public rallies in French history, gathering 4.4 million people,  the November 2015 Paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II,   and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004  and the 2016 Nice attack  which caused 87 deaths during Bastille Day celebrations.\n\nGeography\n\nLocation and Borders\n\nThe European part of France is called Metropolitan France and it is located in one of the occidental ends of Europe. It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the  north-west, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the south-east. It borders Belgium and  Luxembourg in the north east. It also borders Germany and Switzerland in the east,  Italy and Monaco in the south-east, Spain and Andorra in the south west. The borders in the south and in the east of the country are mountain ranges: the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Jura, the border in the east is from the Rhine river, while the border in the north and the north east melts in no natural elements. Due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as ' (\"The Hexagon\"). Metropolitan France includes various islands: Corsica and coastal islands. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° N, and longitudes 6° W and 10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west.\n\nFrance has Overseas regions across the world. These territories have varying statuses in the territorial administration of France and are located:\n*In South America: French Guiana.\n*In the Atlantic Ocean: Saint Pierre and Miquelon and, in the Antilles: Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n*In the Pacific Ocean: French Polynesia, the special collectivity of New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and Clipperton Island.\n*In the Indian Ocean: Réunion island, Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean, Crozet Islands, St. Paul and Amsterdam islands.\n*In the Indian Ocean: Kerguelen Islands.\n*In the Antarctic: Adélie Land.\n\nFrance has land borders with  Brazil and Suriname in French Guiana and also with the Kingdom of the Netherlands through the French part of Saint Martin.\n\nThe European territory of France covers 551500 km2, the largest among European Union members. France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding Adélie Land), is 643801 km2, 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south central and Pyrenees in the southwest.\n\nDue to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered on all oceans of the planet, France possesses the second-largest Exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2 (4,260,000 mi2), just behind the EEZ of the United States (11,351,000 km2 / 4,383,000 mi2), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia (8,148,250 km2 / 4,111,312 mi2). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world.\n\nAt   above sea level, the highest point in Western Europe, Mont Blanc, is situated in the Alps on the border between France and Italy. France also has extensive river systems such as the Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, and the Rhone, which divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast.\n\nClimate\n\nMost of the plains of metropolitan France excluding Corse, are located in the oceanic area, Cfb, Cwb et Cfc in the classification of Köppen, a little part of the territory built by plains or hills bordering the mediterranean  basin that has a climate designed by Csa and Csb in the Köppen classification. The French metropolitan territory is relatively extended, the climate is not uniform, it is possible to detail at a finer level and to  distinguish the following climate nuances.\n\n*The strict oceanic climate is located in the west of France – it extends from Flandre in The Basque Country on a coastal strip of several tens of kilometres (the limit is difficult to define), closer to the north and south, wider in Britain that is concerned almost entirely by this climate.\n**The south climate is also oceanic but warmer, because nearer to the south, it is affected by the aquitaine aquitaine climate.\n**The climate of the north-west facade is oceanic but cooler than the aquitaine one and the wind intensity is  much stronger.\n*Away from the coast, the climate is always oceanic but it characteristics change a little. In the Paris sedimentary basin and more in the  intra mountain basins the seasonal amplitude becomes a little stronger, the autumn rains and winter especially are less marked; therefore, most of the territory has qualified climate gradient semi-oceanic climate. This is a transition zone between the strict oceanic climate and continental climate:\n**The oceanic degraded climate of plain in the centre.north, sometimes called \"parisien\" due tot eh fact that corresponds approximately to the Paris basin where the oceanic climate is slightly altered;\n**and the semi-continental climate in the north and in the centre-west (Alsace, plains  of Saône  or of middle-Rhône, plains \"dauphinoises\", \"auvergnates\" ou \"savoyardes\" which features further modified by the neighbouring  mountain ranges.\n*Due to the provision of air masses, especially in summer, and mountain borders that isolate some of the rest of the country, the Mediterranean and the lower Rhone valley, swept by the Mistral and Tramontana experiencing Mediterranean climate.\n*The mountain (or alpine) climate is presented  mainly in the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Massif Central, the Jura and the Vosges.\n*In the overseas regions, there are three broad types of climate:\n* A tropical climate in most overseas regions: high constant temperature throughout the year with a dry and a wet season\n* An equatorial climate in French Guiana: high constant temperature throughout the year with even precipitation throughout the year\n* A subpolar climate in Saint Pierre and Miquelon and in most of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands: short mild summers and long very cold winters\n\nFile:Weinberg Cote de Nuits.jpg| Vineyards in Côte de Nuits, Burgundy\nFile:Lavender field.jpg|Mediterranean vegetation (lavender) in Provence\nFile:Aiguille du Dru 3.jpg|Alpine climate (winter) in the French Alps\nFile:Piana Dardo dans les Calanche.jpg|Semi-arid climate in Corsica\nFile:Bora Bora - Mt Otemanu.jpg|Tropical climate in Bora Bora (French Polynesia)\n\nEnvironment\n\nFrance was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in 1971.  Although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world, France is ranked only 17th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as Canada or Australia. This is due to France's decision to invest in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis,  which now accounts for 75% of its electricity production  and results in less pollution.  \n\nLike all European Union members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020,  compared to the U.S. plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels.  , French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China's.  The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted,  which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually.  However, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses. \n\nForests account for 28% of France's land area,   and are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees.  There are nine national parks  and 46 natural parks in France,  with the government planning to convert 20% of its Exclusive Economic Zone into a Marine Protected Area by 2020.  A regional nature park  ( or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the French national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, in order to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area.  A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development, and protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage. The parks also foster ecological research programs and public education in the natural sciences.  there are 49 PNRs in France.\n\nAccording to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index conducted by Yale and Columbia, France was the sixth-most environmentally conscious country in the world, one place higher than the previous report in 2010.  \n\nGeology, topography and hydrography\n\nMetropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era which is the origin of Armorican Massif, central, morvandeau, Vosges, Ardennes and corse. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are themselves much younger and have less eroded forms – the Alpine peak at 4809 meters above sea level at the Mount White. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins, including the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north – the last one includes several areas of particularly fertile ground, including silt trays of Beauce and Brie. In addition, various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhone valley, allow easy communications. The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges of benefits (the French Riviera, for example), plateaus ending on cliffs (the Alabaster Coast), wetlands and forest areas of Sologne or wide sandy plains (the Languedoc plain). The river system in France is mainly organised around four major rivers: the Loire, the Seine, the Garonne and the Rhône to which can be added the Meuse and Rhine. The latter of lower importance to France but significant to Europe in general.  The French watershed of the first four matches over 62% of the metropolitan territory. France has 11 million square kilometres of marine waters under its jurisdiction, within three oceans of which 97% are overseas.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nFrance is divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in metropolitan France (including the territorial collectivity of Corsica),  and five located overseas. The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments,  which are numbered mainly alphabetically. This number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates. Among the 101 departments of France, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs) and are an integral part of France (and the European Union) and thus enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments.\n\nThe 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons. These cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council. Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements.\n\nThe regions, departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities, meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the Vichy regime and definitely abolished by the Fourth Republic in 1946. \n\nThe 13 regions of Metropolitan France (from January 2016): \n\nThe 22 regions of France (until 31December 2015):\n\nOverseas territories and collectivities\n\nIn addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna), one sui generis collectivity (New Caledonia), one overseas territory (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island).\n\nOverseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (with the exception of St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Fortuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc  whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro. \n\nPolitics\n\nGovernment\n\nThe French Republic is a unitary semi-presidential republic with strong democratic traditions.  The constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958.  It greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to parliament. The executive branch itself has two leaders: the President of the Republic, currently François Hollande, who is head of state and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term (formerly 7 years),  and the Government, led by the president-appointed Prime Minister, currently Manuel Valls.\n\nThe French parliament is a bicameral legislature comprising a National Assembly (Assemblée Nationale) and a Senate.  The National Assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms.  The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government, and thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms), and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in September 2008. \n\nThe Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.  The government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament.\n\nFrench politics are characterised by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred on the French Socialist Party, and the other right-wing, centred previously around the Rassemblement pour la République (RPR), then its successor the UMP Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), which in 2015 was renamed Les Républicains.  Since the 2012 elections, the executive branch is currently composed mostly of the Socialist Party.\n\nLaw\n\nFrance uses a civil legal system; that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law). Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation, wrote about the management of prisons: Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality. That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.\n\nFrench law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law. Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited).  While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State.\n\nTo be applicable, every law must be officially published in the Journal officiel de la République française.\n\nFrance does not recognize religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, \"offenses against public decency\" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples are permitted, and since May 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal in France.  Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881. Some consider however that hate speech laws in France are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech. \nFrance has laws against racism and antisemitism.  Since 1990, the Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial.\n\nFrance's attitude towards freedom of religion is complex. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitutional rights set forth in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. However, since the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, the State tries to prevent its policy-making from being influenced by religion and became suspicious in recent decades towards new religious tendencies of the French society: the Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995, and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public. As some have complained that they have suffered from discrimination thus, and after criticism by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch,   these laws remain controversial, although they are supported by most of the population.\n\nForeign relations\n\nFrance is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights.  In 2015, France was described as being \"the best networked state in the world\", because it is a country that \"is member of more multi-lateral organisations than any other country\". \n\nFrance is a member of the G8, World Trade Organization (WTO),  the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC)  and the Indian Ocean Commission (COI).  It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS)  and a leading member of the International Francophone Organisation (OIF) of fifty-one fully or partly French-speaking countries. \n\nAs a significant hub for international relations, France hosts the second largest assembly of diplomatic missions in the world and the headquarters of international organizations including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and la Francophonie. \n\nPostwar French foreign policy has been largely shaped by membership of the European Union, of which it was a founding member. Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.  In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process,  seeking to build its own standing in continental Europe. However, since 1904, France has maintained an \"Entente cordiale\" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily.\n\nFrance is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), but under President de Gaulle, it excluded itself from the joint military command to protest the special relationship between the United States and Britain and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies.  France vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq,   straining bilateral relations with the US   and the UK.  However, as a result of Nicolas Sarkozy's pro-American politics (much criticised in France by the leftists and by a part of the right),   France rejoined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the country drew considerable criticism from other nations for its underground nuclear tests in French Polynesia. \n\nFrance retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (Françafrique)  and has supplied economic aid and troops for peace-keeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.  Recently, after the unilateral declaration of independence of northern Mali by the Tuareg MNLA and the subsequent regional Northern Mali conflict with several Islamist groups including Ansar Dine and MOJWA, France and other African states intervened to help the Malian Army to retake control.\n\nIn 2013, France was the fourth largest (in absolute terms) donor of development aid in the world, behind the US, the UK and Germany. This represents 0.36% of its GDP, in this regard rating France as twelfth largest donor on the list.  The organisation managing the French help is the French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub-Saharan Africa. The main goals of this help are \"developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy\".[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france-priorities_1/index.html France priorities] – France Diplomatie\n\nMilitary\n\nThe French Armed Forces (Forces armées françaises) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the president as supreme commander. They consist of the French Army (Armée de Terre), French Navy (Marine Nationale, formerly called Armée de Mer), the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air), the French Strategic Nuclear Force (Force Nucléaire Stratégique, nicknamed Force de Frappe or \"Strike Force\")  and the Military Police called National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale), which also fulfils civil police duties in the rural areas of France. Together they are among the largest armed forces in the world and the largest in the EU.\n\nWhile the Gendarmerie  is an integral part of the French armed forces (gendarmes are career soldiers), and therefore under the purview of the Ministry of Defence, it is operationally attached to the Ministry of the Interior as far as its civil police duties are concerned.\n\nWhen acting as general purpose police force, the Gendarmerie encompasses the counter terrorist units of the Parachute Intervention Squadron of the National Gendarmerie (Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the Search Sections of the National Gendarmerie (Sections de Recherche de la Gendarmerie Nationale), responsible for criminal enquiries, and the Mobile Brigades of the National Gendarmerie (Brigades mobiles de la Gendarmerie Nationale, or in short Gendarmerie mobile) which have the task to maintain public order.\n\nThe following special units are also part of the Gendarmerie:\nThe Republican Guard (Garde républicaine) which protects public buildings hosting major French institutions,\nthe Maritime Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie maritime) serving as Coast Guard,\nthe Provost Service (Prévôté), acting as the Military Police branch of the Gendarmerie.\n\nAs far as the French intelligence units are concerned, the Directorate-General for External Security (Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure) is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defence. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur) is a division of the National Police Force (Direction générale de la Police Nationale), and therefore reports directly to the Ministry of the Interior. There has been no national conscription since 1997. \n\nFrance has a special military corps, the French Foreign Legion, founded in 1830, which consists of foreign nationals from over 140 countries who are willing to serve in the French Armed Forces and become French citizens after the end of their service period. The only other countries having similar units are Spain (the Spanish Foreign Legion, called Tercio, was founded in 1920) and Luxembourg (foreigners can serve in the National Army provided they speak Luxembourgish).\n\nFrance is a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN, and a recognised nuclear state since 1960. France has signed and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. France's annual military expenditure in 2011 was US$62.5 billion, or 2.3%, of its GDP making it the fifth biggest military spender in the world after the United States, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom. \n\nFrench nuclear deterrence, (formerly known as \"Force de Frappe\"), relies on complete independence. The current French nuclear force consists of four Triomphant class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 ASMP medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads,  of which around 50 are deployed by the Air Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM) attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved ASMP-A missile with a nuclear warhead.\n\nFrance has major military industries with one of the largest aerospace industries in the world.   Its industries have produced such equipment as the Rafale fighter, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile and the Leclerc tank among others. Despite withdrawing from the Eurofighter project, France is actively investing in European joint projects such as the Eurocopter Tiger, multipurpose frigates, the UCAV demonstrator nEUROn and the Airbus A400M. France is a major arms seller,   with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market with the notable exception of nuclear-powered devices.\n\nThe military parade held in Paris each 14 July for France's national day, called Bastille Day in English-speaking countries (but not in France), is the oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe. \n\nGovernment finance\n\nIn April and May 2012, France held a presidential election in which the winner, François Hollande, had opposed austerity measures, promising to eliminate France's budget deficit by 2017. The new government stated that it aimed to cancel recently enacted tax cuts and exemptions for the wealthy, raising the top tax bracket rate to 75% on incomes over a million euros, restoring the retirement age to 60 with a full pension for those who have worked 42 years, restoring 60,000 jobs recently cut from public education, regulating rent increases; and building additional public housing for the poor.\n\nIn June, Hollande's Socialist Party won a supermajority in legislative elections capable of amending the French Constitution and enabling the immediate enactment of the promised reforms. French government bond interest rates fell 30% to record lows,  less than 50 basis points above German government bond rates. \n\nUnder European Union rules, member states are supposed to limit their debt to 60% of output or be reducing the ratio structurally towards this ceiling, and run public deficits of no more than 3% of GDP. The French government has run a budget deficit each year since the early 1970s. In 2012, French government debt levels reached 1.8 trillion euros, the equivalent of 90% of French GDP. \n\nIn late 2012, credit rating agencies warned that growing French government debt levels risked France's AAA credit rating, raising the possibility of a future downgrade and subsequent higher borrowing costs for the French government. \n\nEconomy\n\nA member of the Group of 7 (formerly G8) leading industrialised countries, , it is ranked as the world's ninth largest and the EU's second largest economy by purchasing power parity. With 31 of the 500 biggest companies in the world in 2015, France ranks fourth in the Fortune Global 500, ahead of Germany and the UK.  France joined 11 other EU members to launch the euro in 1999, with euro coins and banknotes completely replacing the French franc (₣) in 2002. \n\nFrance has a mixed economy that combines extensive private enterprise   with substantial state enterprise and government intervention. The government retains considerable influence over key segments of infrastructure sectors, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, nuclear power and telecommunications. It has been relaxing its control over these sectors since the early 1990s. The government is slowly corporatising the state sector and selling off holdings in France Télécom, Air France, as well as in the insurance, banking, and defence industries. France has an important aerospace industry led by the European consortium Airbus, and has its own national spaceport, the Centre Spatial Guyanais.\n\nAccording to the World Trade Organization (WTO), in 2009 France was the world's sixth largest exporter and the fourth largest importer of manufactured goods.  In 2008, France was the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment among OECD countries at $118 billion, ranking behind Luxembourg (where foreign direct investment was essentially monetary transfers to banks located there) and the US ($316 billion), but above the UK ($96.9 billion), Germany ($25 billion), or Japan ($24 billion).\n\nIn the same year, French companies invested $220 billion outside France, ranking France as the second largest outward direct investor in the OECD, behind the US ($311 billion), and ahead of the UK ($111 billion), Japan ($128 billion) and Germany ($157 billion).\n\nFinancial services, banking and the insurance sector are an important part of the economy. The Paris stock exchange () is an old institution, created by Louis XV in 1724.  In 2000, the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam and Bruxelles merged into Euronext. In 2007, Euronext merged with the New York stock exchange to form NYSE Euronext, the world's largest stock exchange. Euronext Paris, the French branch of the NYSE Euronext group is Europe's 2nd largest stock exchange market, behind the London Stock Exchange.\n\nFrance is part of the European single market which represents more than 500 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. France introduced the common European currency, the Euro in 2002.  It is a member of the Eurozone which represents around 330 million citizens.\n\nFrench companies have maintained key positions in the insurance and banking industries: AXA is the world's largest insurance company. The leading French banks are BNP Paribas and the Crédit Agricole, ranking as the world's first and sixth largest banks in 2010  (by assets), while the Société Générale group was ranked the world's eighth largest in 2009.\n\nAgriculture\n\nFrance has historically been a large producer of agricultural products.[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/France-AGRICULTURE.html France – Agriculture] – Encyclopedia of the Nations Extensive tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and EU subsidies have combined to make France the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe  (representing 20% of the EU's agricultural production ) and the world's third biggest exporter of agricultural products. \n\nWheat, poultry, dairy, beef, and pork, as well as internationally recognized processed foods are the primary French agricultural exports. Rosé wines are primarily consumed within the country, but Champagne and Bordeaux wines are major exports, being known worldwide. EU agriculture subsidies to France have decreased in recent years but still amounted to $8 billion in 2007.  That same year, France sold 33.4 billion euros of transformed agricultural products. \n\nAgriculture is an important sector of France's economy: 3.8% of the active population is employed in agriculture, whereas the total agri-food industry made up 4.2% of French GDP in 2005.\n\nTourism\n\nWith 83 million foreign tourists in 2012, France is ranked as the first tourist destination in the world, ahead of the US (67 million) and China (58 million). This 83 million figure excludes people staying less than 24 hours, such as North Europeans crossing France on their way to Spain or Italy. It is third in income from tourism due to shorter duration of visits.  France has 37 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (litt. \"The Most Beautiful Villages of France\"). The \"Remarkable Gardens\" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the French Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year.\n\nFrance, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world, the Musée d'Orsay, mostly devoted to impressionism, and Beaubourg, dedicated to Contemporary art. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009. \n\nWith more than 10 millions tourists a year, the French Riviera (or Côte d'Azur), in south-east France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris region.  It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 km of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.  Each year the Côte d'Azur hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet. \n\nAnother major destination are the Châteaux of the Loire Valley, this World Heritage Site is noteworthy for its architectural heritage, in its historic towns but in particular its castles (châteaux), such as the Châteaux d'Amboise, de Chambord, d'Ussé, de Villandry and Chenonceau. The most popular tourist sites include: (according to a 2003 ranking  visitors per year): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Louvre Museum (5.7 million), Palace of Versailles (2.8 million), Musée d'Orsay (2.1 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Centre Pompidou (1.2 million), Mont Saint-Michel (1 million), Château de Chambord (711,000), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000), Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), Carcassonne (362,000).\n\nEnergy\n\nÉlectricité de France (EDF), the main electricity generation and distribution company in France, is also one of the world's largest producers of electricity. In 2003, it produced 22% of the European Union's electricity, primarily from nuclear power. France is the smallest emitter of carbon dioxide among the G8, due to its heavy investment in nuclear power.  As a result of large investments in nuclear technology, most electricity produced by France is generated by 59 nuclear power plants (75% in 2012).  In this context, renewable energies are having difficulty taking off. France also uses hydroelectric dams to produce electricity, such as the Eguzon dam, Étang de Soulcem, and Lac de Vouglans.\n\nTransport\n\nThe railway network of France, which  stretches 29473 km  is the second most extensive in Western Europe after that of Germany.  It is operated by the SNCF, and high-speed trains include the Thalys, the Eurostar and TGV, which travels at 320 km/h in commercial use.  The Eurostar, along with the Eurotunnel Shuttle, connects with the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighbouring countries in Europe, except Andorra. Intra-urban connections are also well developed with both underground services (Paris, Lyon, Lille, Marseille, Toulouse, Rennes) and tramway services (Nantes, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Montpellier...) complementing bus services.\n\nThere are approximately 1027183 km of serviceable roadway in France, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent.  The Paris region is enveloped with the most dense network of roads and highways that connect it with virtually all parts of the country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighbouring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee or road tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault (27% of cars sold in France in 2003), Peugeot (20.1%) and Citroën (13.5%).  Over 70% of new cars sold in 2004 had diesel engines, far more than contained petrol or LPG engines.  France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge,  and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie.\n\nThere are 464 airports in France. Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world. Air France is the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports in France, the largest of which is in Marseille,  which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea.   12261 km of waterways traverse France including the Canal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through the Garonne river.\n\nSciences\n\nSince the Middle Ages, France has been a major contributor to scientific achievement. Around the beginning of the 11th century Pope Sylvester II, born Gerbert d'Aurillac, reintroduced the abacus and armillary sphere, and introduced Arabic numerals and clocks to northern and western Europe.  The University of Paris, founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important universities in the Western world.  In the 17th century, René Descartes defined a method for the acquisition of scientific knowledge, while Blaise Pascal became famous for his work on probability and fluid mechanics. They were both key figures of the Scientific revolution, which erupted in Europe during this period. The Academy of Sciences was founded by Louis XIV to encourage and protect the spirit of French scientific research. It was at the forefront of scientific developments in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is one of the earliest academies of sciences.\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment was marked by the work of biologist Buffon and chemist Lavoisier, who discovered the role of oxygen in combustion, while Diderot and D'Alembert published the Encyclopédie, which aimed to give access to \"useful knowledge\" to the people, a knowledge that they can apply to their everyday life.   With the Industrial Revolution, the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France with scientists such as Augustin Fresnel, founder of modern optics, Sadi Carnot who laid the foundations of thermodynamics, or Louis Pasteur, a pioneer of microbiology. Other eminent French scientists of the 19th century have their names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\n\nFamous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré, physicists Henri Becquerel, Pierre and Marie Curie, remained famous for their work on radioactivity, the physicist Paul Langevin or virologist Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of HIV AIDS. Hand transplantation was developed on 23 September 1998 in Lyon by a team assembled from different countries around the world including Jean-Michel Dubernard who, shortly thereafter, performed the first successful double hand transplant. Telesurgery was developed by Jacques Marescaux and his team on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean (New-York-Strasbourg, Lindbergh Operation). A face transplant was first done on 27 November 2005   by Dr Bernard Devauchelle.\n\nFrance was the fourth country to achieve nuclear capability  and has the third largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world.  It is also a leader in civilian nuclear technology.    France was the third nation, after the former USSR and the United States, to launch its own space satellite and remains the biggest contributor to the European Space Agency (ESA).    The European Airbus Group, formed from the French group Aérospatiale along with DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA) and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA), designs and develops civil and military aircraft as well as communications systems, missiles, space rockets, helicopters, satellites, and related systems. From 1970 SNCF, the French national railroad company, has developed the TGV, a high speed train which holds a series of world speed records. The TGV has been the fastest wheeled train in commercial use since reaching a speed of 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph) on 3 April 2007.  Western Europe is now serviced by a network of TGV lines.\n\n, 67 French people have been awarded a Nobel Prize  and 12 have received the Fields Medal. \n\nDemographics\n\nWith an estimated total population of around 66.6 million people as of January 2016, with 64.5 million in metropolitan France, France is the 20th most populous country in the world and the third-most populous in Europe.\n\nFrance is an outlier among developed countries in general, and European countries in particular, in having a fairly high rate of natural population growth: by birth rates alone, France was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006, with the natural growth rate (excess of births over deaths) rising to 300,000. This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973, and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010. \n\nFrom 2006 to 2011 population growth was on average +0.6% per year. Immigrants are also major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27% of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and 24% had at least one parent born outside of Europe (parents born in overseas territories are considered as born in France). \n\nEthnic groups\n\nMost French people are of Celtic (Gauls) origin, with an admixture of Latin (Romans) and Germanic (Franks) groups.  Different regions reflect this diverse heritage, with notable Breton elements in western France, Aquitanian in the southwest, Scandinavian in the northwest, Alemannic in the northeast and Ligurian influence in the southeast.\n\nLarge-scale immigration over the last century and a half has led to a more multicultural society. In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were North African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).  \n\nA law originating from the 1789 revolution and reaffirmed in the 1958 French Constitution makes it illegal for the French state to collect data on ethnicity and ancestry. In 2008, the TeO (\"Trajectories and origins\") poll conducted jointly by INED and the French National Institute of Statistics   estimated that 5 million people were of Italian ancestry (the largest immigrant community), followed by 3 million   to 6 million  people of North African ancestry, 2.5 million people of Sub-Saharan African origin, and 200,000 people of Turkish ancestry.  There are also sizeable minorities of other European ethnic groups, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Romani, Polish, and Greek.  \n\nIt is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration the country has received since the early 20th century;  between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.  The next largest wave came in the 1960s, when around 1.6 million pieds noirs returned to France following the independence of its North African possessions, Algeria and Morocco.   They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous immigrants from Spain and Portugal.\n\nFrance remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.  It is also Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications in 2005 (a 15% decrease from 2004).  The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration, and immigration remains a contentious political issue.\n\nIn 2008, the INSEE estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million where of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi ancestry.    In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly to people from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey. \n\nIn 2014 The National Institute of Statistics (INSEE, for its acronym in French) published a study which reported doubling of the number of Spanish immigrants, Portuguese and Italians in France between 2009 and 2012.\nAccording to the French Institute, this increase resulting from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period, has pushed up the number of Europeans installed in France. \nStatistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 percent between 2009 and 2012, i.e. in this period went from 5300 to 11,000 people.\nOf the total of 229,000 foreigners who were in France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, 5% British, 5% Spanish, 4% Italians, 4% Germans, 3% Romanians, and 3% Belgians.\n\nMajor cities\n\nFrance is a highly urbanized country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population in 2013 ) being Paris (12,405,426 inh.), Lyon (2,237,676), Marseille (1,734,277), Toulouse (1,291,517), Bordeaux (1,178,335), Lille (1,175,828), Nice (1,004,826), Nantes (908,815), Strasbourg (773,447) and Rennes (700,675). (Note: There are significant differences between the metropolitan population figures just cited and those in the following table, which only include the core population). Rural flight was a perennial political issue throughout most of the 20th century.\n\nLanguage\n\nAccording to Article 2 of the Constitution, the official language of France is French,  a Romance language derived from Latin. Since 1635, the Académie française has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal power.\n\nThe French government does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as La Francophonie. The perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French overseas territories.\n\nFrom the 17th to the mid-20th century, French served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a lingua franca among the educated classes of Europe.Joffre Agnes [http://www.franceinlondon.com/en-Article-335-Is-the-French-obsession-with-cultural-exception-declining-Culture--london-language.html ls the French obsession with \"cultural exception\" declining?]. France in London. 5 October 2008 The dominant position of French language in international affairs was overtaken by English, since the emergence of the US as a major power.  \n\nFor most of the time in which French served as an international lingua franca, it was not the native language of most Frenchmen: a report in 1794 conducted by Henri Grégoire found that of the country's 25 million people, only three million spoke French natively; the rest spoke one of the country's many regional languages, such as Alsatian, Breton or Occitan.  Through the expansion of public education, in which French was the sole language of instruction, as well as other factors such as increased urbanization and the rise of mass communication, French gradually came to be adopted by virtually the entire population, a process not completed until the 20th century.\n\nAs a result of France's extensive colonial ambitions between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, and the Caribbean. French is the second most studied foreign language in the world after English,  and is a lingua franca in some regions, notably in Africa. The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies (The Levant, South and Southeast Asia), while creoles and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the West Indies and the South Pacific (French Polynesia). On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers is increasing, especially in Africa.\n\nIt is estimated that between 300 million  and 500 million  people worldwide can speak French, either as a mother tongue or a second language.\n\nReligion\n\n France is a secular country, and freedom of religion is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of laïcité, a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular.\n\nCatholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practised today as it was. Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic.  While in 1965, 81% of the French declared themselves to be Catholics, in 2009 this proportion was 64%. Moreover, while 27% of the French went to Mass once a week or more in 1952, only 5% did so in 2006. [http://www.la-croix.com/Religion/S-informer/Actualite/La-France-reste-catholique-mais-moins-pratiquante-_NG_-2009-12-29-570979 La France reste catholique mais moins pratiquante] – La Croix. 29 December 2009 The same survey found that Protestants accounted for 3% of the population, an increase from previous surveys, and 5% adhered to other religions, with the remaining 28% stating they had no religion. Evangelical Protestantism may be the fastest growing religion in France. \n\nThe French Revolution saw a radical shift in the status of the Catholic Church with the launch of a brutal campaign of de-Christianization. After the back and forth of Catholic royal and secular republican governments over the 19th century, laïcité was established with the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. \n\nAccording to a poll in January 2007,  only 5% of the French population attended church regularly (10% attend church services regularly among the respondents who did identify themselves as Catholics). The poll showed  51% identified as being Catholics, 31% identified as being agnostics or atheists (another poll  sets the proportion of atheists equal to 27%), 10% identified as being from other religions or being without opinion, 4% identified as Muslim, 3% identified as Protestant, 1% identified as Buddhist, 1% identified as Jewish. Meanwhile, an independent estimate by the politologist Pierre Bréchon in 2009 concluded that the proportion of Catholics had fallen to 42% while the number of atheists and agnostics had risen to 50%.  According to Eurobarometer poll in 2012 Christianity is the largest religion in France accounting 60% of French citizens. The question asked was \"Do you consider yourself to be...?\" With a card showing: Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Other Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu, Atheist, and Non-believer/Agnostic.  Space was given for Other (SPONTANEOUS) and DK. Jewish, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu did not reach the 1% threshold. Catholics are the largest Christian group in France, accounting for 50% of French citizens, while Protestants make up 8%, and Other Christian make up 2%. Non believer/Agnostic account 20%, Atheist account's 13%, and Muslim 6%.\n\nEstimates of the number of Muslims in France vary widely. In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8–10%).   According to the Pewforum, \"In France, proponents of a 2004 law banning the wearing of religious symbols in schools say it protects Muslim girls from being forced to wear a headscarf, but the law also restricts those who want to wear headscarves – or any other \"conspicuous\" religious symbol, including large Christian crosses and Sikh turbans – as an expression of their faith\" \n\nThe current Jewish community in France numbers around 600,000 according to the World Jewish Congress and is the largest in Europe.\n\nSince 1905 the French government has followed the principle of laïcité, in which it is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like that of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle). Instead, it merely recognises religious organisations, according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organizations should refrain from intervening in policy-making.  Certain bodies of beliefs such as Scientology, Children of God, the Unification Church, or the Order of the Solar Temple are considered cults (\"sectes\" in French),  and therefore do not have the same status as religions in France. Secte is considered a pejorative term in France. \n\nHealth\n\nThe French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the \"close to best overall health care\" in the world.  The French healthcare system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997.   In 2011, France spent 11.6% of GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,  a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but less than in the US. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government funded agencies. \n\nCare is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases (affections de longues durées) such as cancer, AIDS or Cystic Fibrosis. Average life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women, one of the highest of the European Union.  There are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in France,  and average health care spending per capita was US$4,719 in 2008. \n, approximately 140,000 inhabitants (0.4%) of France are living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nEven if the French have the reputation of being one of the thinnest people in developed countries,[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/03/world/europe/03iht-obese.html Even the French are fighting obesity] – The NY Times[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jul2001/nf2001073_981.htm Why So Few French Are Fat] – Bloomberg Businessweek  \nFrance—like other rich countries—faces an increasing and recent epidemic of obesity, due mostly to the replacement of traditional healthy French cuisine by junk food in French eating habits.[http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science-Nutrition/France-heading-for-US-obesity-levels-says-study France heading for US obesity levels says study] – Food Navigator Nevertheless, the French obesity rate is far below that of the USA (for instance, obesity rate in France is the same that the American once was in the 1970s), and is still the lowest of Europe, but it is now regarded by the authorities as one of the main public health issues  and is fiercely fought; rates of childhood obesity are slowing in France, while continuing to grow in other countries. \n\nEducation\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon created the lycée.  Nevertheless, it is Jules Ferry who is considered to be the father of the French modern school, which is free, secular, and compulsory until the age of 13 since 1882  (school attendance in France is now compulsory until the age of 16 ).\n\nNowadays, the schooling system in France is centralized, and is composed of three stages, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks France's education as the 25th best in the world, being neither significantly higher nor lower than the OECD average.  Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the Ministry of National Education. In France, education is compulsory from six to sixteen years old, and the public school is secular and free. If training and remuneration of teachers, and the choice of programs, are the state spring, the management of primary and secondary schools is the responsibility of local authorities. Primary education is made in two phases. The nursery school, which  welcome very young children  has as a main goal their awakening, their socialisation and the development of basic tools that are the language and the number. Then, around the age of six,  children are greeted by elementary school, whose primary objectives are: learning, writing, arithmetic and civics. Secondary education also takes place in two cycles. The first is offered to college and leads to the national certificate (). The second is offered in high school and results in national exams and ends (the bachelor professional, technical or general) and the Certificate of Professional Competence (CAPA in agricultural education).\n\nHigher education in France is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective Grandes écoles, such as Sciences Po Paris for Political studies, HEC Paris for Economics, Polytechnique and the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris that produces high-profile engineers, or the École nationale d'administration for careers in the great corps of the State. The Grandes écoles have been criticised for alleged elitism,  nevertheless they have produced many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs, and politicians.\n\nSince higher education is funded by the state, the fees are very low; the tuition varies from €150 to €700 depending on the university and the different levels of education. (licence, master, doctorate). One can therefore get a master's degree (in 5 years) for about €750–3,500. The tuition in public engineering schools is comparable to universities, albeit a little higher (around €700). However it can reach €7000 a year for private engineering schools, and some business schools, which are all private or partially private, charge up to €15000 a year. Health insurance for students is free until the age of 20.\n\nCulture\n\nFrance has been a center of Western cultural development for centuries. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time, and France is still recognized in the world for its rich cultural tradition.\n\nThe successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation, and the creation of the Ministry of Culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting historical monuments. The French government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country.\n\nFrance receives the highest number of tourists per year, largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory. It counts 1,200 museums welcoming more than 50 million people annually.  The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency Centre des monuments nationaux, which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments.\n\nThe 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences (many castles, or châteaux in French) and religious buildings (cathedrals, basilicas, churches, etc.), but also statutes, memorials and gardens. The UNESCO inscribed 41 sites in France on the World Heritage List. \n\nArt\n\nThe origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy.\n\nThe 17th century was the period when French painting became prominent and individualized itself through classicism. Louis XIV's prime minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert founded in 1648 the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture to protect these artists, and in 1666 he created the still-active French Academy in Rome to have direct relations with Italian artists.\n\nFrench artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism. At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first Romanticism with Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix, and Realism with Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet, a style that eventually evolved into Naturalism.\n\nIn the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir.  The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,  as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.  \n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Vincent van Gogh, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Wassily Kandinsky.\n\nMany museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works. A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned Musée du Louvre, such as Mona Lisa, also known as La Joconde. While the Louvre Palace has been for a long time a museum, the Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganization of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).  \n\nModern works are presented in the Musée National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou. These three state-owned museums welcome close to 17 million people a year. Ministry of Tourism, [http://www.tourisme.gouv.fr/stat_etudes/memento/2009/sites.pdf Sites touristiques en France] page 2 \"Palmarès des 30 premiers sites culturels (entrées comptabilisées)\" [Ranking of 30 most visited cultural sites in France] Other national museums hosting paintings include the Grand Palais (1.3 million visitors in 2008), but there are also many museums owned by cities, the most visited being the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (0.8 million entries in 2008), which hosts contemporary works.\n\nOutside Paris, all the large cities have a Museum of Fine Arts with a section dedicated to European and French painting. Some of the finest collections are in Lyon, Lille, Rouen, Dijon, Rennes and Grenoble.\n\nArchitecture\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Château d'Angers, the massive Château de Vincennes and the so-called Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe. Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the Saint Sernin Basilica in Toulouse, the largest romanesque church in Europe,  and the remains of the Cluniac Abbey.\n\nThe Gothic architecture, originally named Opus Francigenum meaning \"French work\",  was born in Île-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be copied in all Europe.  Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims.  Aside from churches, Gothic Architecture had been used for many religious palaces, the most important one being the Palais des Papes in Avignon.\n\nThe final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley. Such residential castles were the Château de Chambord, the Château de Chenonceau, or the Château d'Amboise.\n\nFollowing the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one.  In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architect of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides.  Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.  \n\nAfter the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although neoclassicism was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such building as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire style architecture. \n\nUnder Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated to this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic Eiffel Tower.\n\nIn the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters, or 121 feet.  France's largest financial district is La Defense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.  Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc or Paul Andreu.\n\nLiterature\n\nThe earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French mediaeval texts are unknown, such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot-Grail. Other authors are known, for example Chrétien de Troyes and Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who wrote in Occitan.\n\nMuch mediaeval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the Matter of France, such as The Song of Roland and the various chansons de geste. The Roman de Renart, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the mediaeval character Reynard ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing.\n\nAn important 16th-century writer was François Rabelais, whose novel Gargantua and Pantagruel has remained famous and appreciated until now. Michel de Montaigne was the other major figure of the French literature during that century. His most famous work, Essais, created the literary genre of the essay.  French poetry during that century was embodied by Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. Both writers founded the La Pléiade literary movement.\n\nDuring the 17th century, Madame de La Fayette published anonymously La Princesse de Clèves, a novel that is considered to be one of the very first psychological novels of all times.  Jean de La Fontaine is one of the most famous fabulist of that time, as he wrote hundreds of fables, some being far more famous than others, such as The Ant and the Grasshopper. Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables, that were seen as helping teaching wisdom and common sense to the young people. Some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs.\n\nJean Racine, whose incredible mastery of the alexandrine and of the French language has been praised for centuries, created plays such as Phèdre or Britannicus. He is, along with Pierre Corneille (Le Cid) and Molière, considered as one of the three great dramatists of the France's golden age. Molière, who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the Western literature,  wrote dozens of plays, including Le Misanthrope, L'Avare, Le Malade imaginaire, and Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme. His plays have been so popular around the world that French language is sometimes dubbed as \"the language of Molière\" (la langue de Molière),  just like English is considered as \"the language of Shakespeare\".\n\nFrench literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot's best-known works are Jacques the Fatalist and Rameau's Nephew. He is however best known for being the main redactor of the Encyclopédie, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, philosophy) and to present them to the people, in order to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bluebeard. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé. \n\nThe 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as \"the greatest French writer of all times\" for excelling in all literary genres. The preface of his play Cromwell is considered to be the manifesto of the Romantic movement. Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles are considered as \"poetic masterpieces\", Hugo's verse having been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer. His novel Les Misérables is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written  and The Hunchback of Notre Dame has remained immensely popular.\n\nOther major authors of that century include Alexandre Dumas (The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte-Cristo), Jules Verne (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea), Émile Zola (Les Rougon-Macquart), Honoré de Balzac (La Comédie humaine), Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gautier and Stendhal (The Red and the Black, The Charterhouse of Parma), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world.\n\nThe Prix Goncourt is a French literary prize first awarded in 1903.  Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint Exupéry wrote Little Prince, which has remained popular for decades with children and adults around the world.  , French authors had more Literature Nobel Prizes than those of any other nation.  The first Nobel Prize in Literature was a French author, while France's latest Nobel prize in literature is Patrick Modiano, who was awarded the prize in 2014. Jean-Paul Sartre was also the first nominee in the committee's history to refuse the prize in 1964.\n\nPhilosophy\n\nMedieval philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism until the emergence of Humanism in the Renaissance. Modern philosophy began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of René Descartes, Blaise Pascal, and Nicolas Malebranche. Descartes revitalised Western philosophy, which had been declined after the Greek and Roman eras.  His Meditations on First Philosophy changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, Berkeley, and Kant.\n\nDuring the 18th century, French philosophers produced one of the most important works of the Age of Enlightenment. In The Spirit of the Laws, Baron de Montesquieu theorized the principle of separation of powers, which has been implemented in all liberal democracies since it was first applied in the United States. In The Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau openly criticized the European divine right monarchies and strongly affirmed the principle of the sovereignty of the people. Voltaire came to embody the Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion.\n\n19th-century French thought was targeted at responding to the social malaise following the French Revolution. Rationalist philosophers such as Victor Cousin and Auguste Comte, who called for a new social doctrine, were opposed by reactionary thinkers such as Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Bonald and Lamennais, who blamed the rationalist rejection of traditional order. De Maistre is considered, together with the Englishman Edmund Burke, one of the founders of European conservatism, while Comte is regarded as the founder of positivism and sociology.\n\nIn the early 20th century, French spiritualist thinkers such as Maine de Biran, Henri Bergson and Louis Lavelle influenced Anglo-Saxon thought, including the Americans Charles Sanders Peirce and William James, and the Englishman Alfred North Whitehead. In the late 20th century, partly influenced by German phenomenology and existentialism, postmodern philosophy began in France, with notable post-structuralist thinkers including Jean-François Lyotard, Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze.\n\nMusic\n\nFrance has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed a number of talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer for the harpsichord. \n\nFrench composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the Romantic music era. Romantic music emphasized a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: Hector Berlioz (best known for his Symphonie fantastique), Georges Bizet (best known for Carmen, which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas), Gabriel Fauré (best known for his Pavane, Requiem, and nocturnes), Charles Gounod (best known for his Ave Maria and his opera Faust), Jacques Offenbach (best known for his 100 operettas of the 1850s–1870s and his uncompleted opera The Tales of Hoffmann), Édouard Lalo (best known for his Symphonie espagnole for violin and orchestra and his Cello Concerto in D minor), Jules Massenet (best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty, the most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892)) and Camille Saint-Saëns (he has many frequently-performed works, including The Carnival of the Animals, Danse macabre, Samson and Delilah (Opera), Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, and his Symphony No. 3 (Organ Symphony)).\n\nLater came precursors of modern classical music. Érik Satie was a key member of the early 20th century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his Gymnopédies. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perpétuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champêtre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carmélites (1957), and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.  Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms     and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the Rapsodie espagnole, Daphnis et Chloé, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and his orchestral work Boléro (1928).\n\nMore recently, at the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music. \n\nFrench music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson française, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries,  bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and GojiraFrance Diplomatie, [http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/culture-and-media_6819/culture_6874/music_5335/french-music-has-the-whole-planet-singing_13031.html French music has the whole planet singing], June 2009 have reached worldwide popularity.\n\nOther French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, for example female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu, Mylène Farmer and Nolwenn Leroy,  electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, and later Martin Solveig and David Guetta. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world.  \n\nAmong current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera (with its two sites Palais Garnier and Opéra Bastille), the Opéra National de Lyon, the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, the Théâtre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux. As for music festivals, there are several events organized, the most popular being the Eurockéennes and Rock en Seine. The Fête de la Musique, imitated by many foreign cities, was first launched by the French government in 1982.   Major music halls and venues in France include Le Zénith sites present in many cities and other places in Paris (Paris Olympia, Théâtre Mogador, Élysée Montmartre, etc.).\n\nCinema\n\nFrance has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the Lumière Brothers) having created cinema in 1895.  Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a particularly strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the French government.  France remains a leader in filmmaking,  producing more films than any other European country.  The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.  \n\nApart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, and Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé and Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke), and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur, or Francis Veber in the United States.\n\nAlthough the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan. Damien Rousselière [http://www.erudit.org/revue/hphi/2005/v15/n2/801295ar.pdf Cinéma et diversité culturelle: le cinéma indépendant face à la mondialisation des industries culturelles]. Horizons philosophiques Vol. 15 No. 2 2005 French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK. France is in 2013 the 2nd exporter of films in the world after the United States. \n\nUntil recently, France had for centuries been the cultural center of the world, although its dominant position has been surpassed by the United States. Subsequently, France takes steps in protecting and promoting its culture, becoming a leading advocate of the cultural exception.  The nation succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalized sectors of the WTO in 1993.  Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a voting in the UNESCO in 2005, and the principle of \"cultural exception\" won an overwhelming victory: 198 countries voted for it, only 2 countries, the U.S and Israel, voted against it. \n\nFashion\n\nFashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern \"haute couture\" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.\n\nThe association of France with fashion and style () dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV  when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion () industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. The French perfume industry is world leader in its sector and is centered on the town of Grasse. \n\nIn the 1960s, the elitist \"Haute couture\" came under criticism from France's youth culture. In 1966, the designer Yves Saint Laurent broke with established Haute Couture norms by launching a prêt-à-porter (\"ready to wear\") line and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established by Sonia Rykiel, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as LVMH.\n\nMedia\n\nCompared to other developed countries, the French do not spend much time reading newspapers, due to the popularity of broadcast media. Best-selling daily national newspapers in France are Le Parisien Aujourd'hui en France (with 460,000 sold daily), Le Monde and Le Figaro, with around 300,000 copies sold daily, but also L'Équipe, dedicated to sports coverage.  In the past years, free dailies made a breakthrough, with Metro, 20 Minutes and Direct Plus distributed at more than 650,000 copies respectively.  However, the widest circulations are reached by regional daily Ouest France with more than 750,000 copies sold, and the 50 other regional papers have also high sales.   The sector of weekly magazines is stronger and diversified with more than 400 specialized weekly magazines published in the country. \n\nThe most influential news magazines are the left-wing Le Nouvel Observateur, centrist L'Express and right-wing Le Point (more than 400.000 copies),  but the highest circulation for weeklies is reached by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them Marie Claire and ELLE, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers Le Canard Enchaîné and Charlie Hebdo, as well as Paris Match. Like in most industrialized nations, the print media have been affected by a severe crisis in the past decade. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent,   but in 2009 it had to give 600,000 euros to help the print media cope with the economic crisis, in addition to existing subsidies. \n\nIn 1974, after years of centralized monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations  Vie Publique, [http://www.vie-publique.fr/politiques-publiques/politique-audiovisuel/chronologie/ Chronologie de la politique de l'audiovisuel] 20 August 2004 [Chronology of policy for audiovisual] remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio. French television was partly liberalized in the next two decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service Télévision Numérique Terrestre introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels.\n\nThe four existing national channels are now owned by state-owned consortium France Télévisions, while public broadcasting group Radio France run five national radio stations. Among these public media are Radio France Internationale, which broadcasts programs in French all over the world, and Franco-German TV channel TV5 Monde. In 2006, the government created global news channel France 24. Long-established TV channels TF1 (privatized in 1987), France 2 and France 3 have the highest shares, while radio stations RTL, Europe 1 and state-owned France Inter are the least listened to.\n\nSociety\n\nAccording to a BBC poll in 2010, based on 29,977 responses in 28 countries, France is globally seen as a positive influence in the world's affairs: 49% have a positive view of the country's influence, whereas 19% have a negative view.   The Nation Brand Index of 2008 suggested that France has the second best international reputation, only behind Germany. \n\nAccording to a poll in 2011, the French were found to have the highest level of religious tolerance and to be the country where the highest proportion of the population defines its identity primarily in term of nationality and not religion. 69% of French have a favourable view of the US, making France one of the most pro-American countries in the world. \n\nIn January 2010, the magazine International Living ranked France as \"best country to live in\", ahead of 193 other countries, for the fifth year running. \n\nThe French Revolution continues to permeate the country's collective memory. The tricolour flag, the anthem \"La Marseillaise\", and the motto Liberté, egalité, fraternité, defined in Title 1 of the Constitution as national symbols, all emerged during the cultural ferment of the early revolution, along with Marianne, a common national personification. In addition, Bastille Day, the national holiday, commemorates the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789. \n\nA common and traditional symbol of the French people is the Gallic rooster. Its origins date back to Antiquity, since the Latin word Gallus meant both \"rooster\" and \"inhabitant of Gaul\". Then this figure gradually became the most widely shared representation of the French, used by French monarchs, then by the Revolution and under the successive republican regimes as representation of the national identity, used for some stamps and coins. \n\nCuisine\n\nFrench cuisine is renowned for being one of the finest in the world.   According to the regions, traditional recipes are different, the North of the country prefers to use butter as the preferred fat for cooking, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the South.  Moreover, each region of France has iconic traditional specialities: Cassoulet in the Southwest, Choucroute in Alsace, Quiche in the Lorraine region, Beef bourguignon in the Bourgogne, provençal Tapenade, etc. France's most renowned products are wines,  including Champagne, Bordeaux, Bourgogne, and Beaujolais as well as a large variety of different cheeses, such as Camembert, Roquefort and Brie. There are more than 400 different varieties.  \n\nA meal often consists of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), fromage (cheese course) and/or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Hors d'œuvres include terrine de saumon au basilic, lobster bisque, foie gras, French onion soup or a croque monsieur. The plat principal could include a pot au feu or steak frites. The dessert could be mille-feuille pastry, a macaron, an éclair, crème brûlée, mousse au chocolat, crêpes, or Café liégeois.\n\nFrench cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the quality of life and the attractiveness of France. A French publication, the Michelin guide, awards Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments.  The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants, at that time more than any other country, although the guide also inspects more restaurants in France than in any other country (by 2010, Japan was awarded as many Michelin stars as France, despite having half the number of Michelin inspectors working there).  \n\nIn addition to it wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), the Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine.\nA meal often consists of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), fromage (cheese course) or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. \n\nFile:French taste of wines.JPG|French wines are usually made to accompany French cuisine\nFile:Frenchonionsoupbirmingham.jpg|French onion soup\nFile:200501 - 6 fromages.JPG|Some French cheeses\nFile:Creme Brulee.jpeg|Crème brûlée\nFile:Quiche.jpg|250px|Quiche\nFile:Arc-en-ciel comestible.jpg|250px |Macaron\n\nSports\n\nPopular sports played in France include football, judo, tennis  and rugby union.  France has hosted events such as the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups,  and the 2007 Rugby World Cup.  France will host UEFA Euro 2016. The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1903, France hosts the annual Tour de France, the most famous road bicycle race in the world.   France is famous for its 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race.  Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including the Paris Masters and the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. French martial arts include Savate and Fencing.\n\nFrance has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games' revival, at the end of the 19th century. [http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/olympic.htm Olympic History] – World Atlas of Travel After Athens was awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics' Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Games in 1900.  Paris was the first home of the International Olympic Committee, before it moved to Lausanne.  Since 1900, France has hosted the Olympics on 4 further occasions: the 1924 Summer Olympics, again in Paris and three Winter Games (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble and 1992 in Albertville).\n\nBoth the national football team and the national rugby union team are nicknamed \"Les Bleus\" in reference to the team's shirt colour as well as the national French tricolour flag. Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players, and over 18,000 registered clubs.  The football team is among the most successful in the world, particularly at the start of the 21st century, with one FIFA World Cup victory in 1998,  one FIFA World Cup second place in 2006,  and two UEFA European Championships in 1984  and 2000.  The top national football club competition is Ligue 1. France has produced some of the greatest players in the world, including three time FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane, three time Ballon d'Or recipient Michel Platini, record holder for most goals scored at a World Cup Just Fontaine, first football player to receive the Légion d'honneur Raymond Kopa, and the all-time leading goalscorer for the French national team Thierry Henry. \n\nRugby union is popular, particularly in Paris and the southwest of France.  The national rugby union team has competed at every Rugby World Cup, and takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship. Stemming from a strong domestic league, the French rugby team has won 16 Six Nations Championships, including 8 grand slams; and has reached the semi-final of the Rugby World Cup 6 times and the final 3 times.\n\nRugby league in France is a sport that is most popular in the south, in cities such as Perpignan and Toulouse. The Catalans Dragons currently play in the Super League, which is the top tier rugby league competition in Europe. The Elite One Championship is the professional competition for rugby league clubs in France.\n\nIn recent decades, France has produced world-elite basketball players, most notably Tony Parker. The French National Basketball Team won gold at the FIBA EuroBasket 2013. The national team has won two Olympic Silver Medals: in 2000 and 1948.",
                "The Netherlands (; ) is the main constituent country () of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a small, densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean.designated Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba within ISO [http://www.iso.org/iso/newsletter_vi-9_fiji-myanmar_and_other_minor_corrections-incl_bulgaria.pdf ISO 3166-1]. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom and Germany.  The largest and most important cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam. Amsterdam is the country's capital,  while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament.  The port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe – as large as the next three largest combined – and was the world's largest port between 1962 and 2004.  The name Holland is also frequently used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.\n\n\"Netherlands\" literally means \"lower countries\", influenced by its low land and flat geography, with only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre above sea level.  Most of the areas below sea level are man-made. Since the late 16th century, large areas (polders) have been reclaimed from the sea and lakes, amounting to nearly 17% of the country's current land mass. With a population density of 408 people per km2 – 505 (July 2016) if water is excluded – the Netherlands is a very densely populated country. Only Bangladesh, South Korea, and Taiwan have both a larger population and a higher population density. Nevertheless, the Netherlands is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products, after the United States.   This is partly due to the fertility of the soil and the mild climate. The Netherlands was the third country in the world to have an elected parliament, and since 1848 it has been governed as a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, organised as a unitary state. The Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and is generally regarded as a liberal country, having legalised abortion, prostitution and euthanasia, while maintaining a progressive drugs policy. In 2001, it became the world's first country to legalise same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Netherlands is a founding member of the EU, Eurozone, G-10, NATO, OECD and WTO, and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union. The country is host to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts: the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The first four are situated in The Hague, as is the EU's criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial co-operation agency Eurojust. This has led to the city being dubbed \"the world's legal capital\".  The Netherlands is also a part of the Schengen Area. The Netherlands has a market-based mixed economy, ranking 17th of 177 countries according to the Index of Economic Freedom.  It had the thirteenth-highest per capita income in the world in 2013 according to the International Monetary Fund. In 2013, the United Nations World Happiness Report ranked the Netherlands as the seventh-happiest country in the world, reflecting its high quality of life. \n\nEtymology\n\nThe Netherlands in its entirety is often referred to by the much older designation \"Holland\" (meaning holt land, or wood land), though this refers only to North and South Holland, two of the nation's twelve provinces, formerly a single province and earlier the County of Holland. This originally Frankish county emerged from the dissolved Frisian Kingdom and was, after the decline of Brabant, economically and politically the most important county in the region. Because of this importance and the emphasis on Holland during the Anglo-Dutch Wars in the 17th and 18th century, Holland served as a pars pro toto for the entire country in English, and is considered either incorrect,   informal,  or on occasion opprobrious, depending on the context, but is more acceptable when referring to the national football team. \n\nPlace names with Neder (or lage), Nieder, Nether (or low) and Nedre are in use in various places in countries where a Germanic language is spoken, and has in French and Latin its respective counterparts in Bas or Inferior. They are sometimes used in relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as Upper, Boven, Oben, Superior or Haut. In the case of the Low Countries the geographical location of the lower region has been more or less downstream and near the sea, the geographical location of the upper region changed over time tremendously. The Romans made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream Germania Inferior (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream Germania Superior (nowadays part of Germany). The designation 'Low' to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of Lower Lorraine, that covered much of the Low Countries.   But this time the corresponding Upper region is Upper Lorraine, in nowadays Northern France. The Dukes of Burgundy, who ruled the Low Countries in the 15th century, used the term les pays de par deçà (~ the lands over here) for the Low Countries as opposed to les pays de par delà (~ the lands over there) for their original homeland: Burgundy in present-day east-central France. \n\nUnder Habsburg rule, Les pays de par deçà developed in pays d'embas (lands down-here),  a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions in Europe. This was translated as Neder-landen in contemporary Dutch official documents. However, Niderlant was also the region between the Meuse and the lower Rhine in the late Middle Ages. The area known as Oberland (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located Cologne.\n\nFrom the mid-sixteenth century on, the Low Countries or the \"Netherlands\" was – besides Flanders – probably the most commonly used name. The Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern United Provinces (Belgica Foederata in Latin, the \"Federated Netherlands\") and the Southern Netherlands (Belgica Regia, \"Royal Netherlands\"). The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. It is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term Benelux.\n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory (before 500 BC)\n\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography. The oldest human (Neanderthal) traces in the Netherlands were found in higher soils, near Maastricht, from 250,000 years ago. After the end of the Ice Age, various Paleolithic groups inhabited the area, and around 8000 BC Mesolithic tribes resided in Friesland and Drenthe, where the oldest canoe in the world was recovered.  Autochthonous hunter-gatherers from the Swifterbant culture are attested from around 5600 BC onwards.Louwe Kooijmans, L.P., \"[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/1108/171_060.pdf?sequence\n1 Trijntje van de Betuweroute, Jachtkampen uit de Steentijd te Hardinxveld-Giessendam]\", 1998, Spiegel Historiael 33, pp. 423–428 They are strongly linked to rivers and open water and were related to the southern Scandinavian Ertebølle culture (5300–4000 BC). To the west, the same tribes might have built hunting camps to hunt winter game. People made the switch to animal husbandry sometime between 4800 BC and 4500 BC. Agricultural transformation took place very gradually, between 4300 BC and 4000 BC.  The farming Funnelbeaker culture extended from Denmark through northern Germany into the northern Netherlands, and erected the dolmens, large stone grave monuments found in Drenthe (built between 4100 BC and 3200 BC). To the southwest, the Vlaardingen culture (around 2600 BC), an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers survived well into the Neolithic period. Around 2950 BC there was a quick and smooth transition from the Funnelbeaker farming culture to the pan-European Corded Ware pastoralist culture., , in J.H.F. Bloemers & T. van Dorp (Eds), Pre- & protohistorie van de lage landen. De Haan/Open Universiteit, 1991. ISBN 90-269-4448-9, NUGI 644 The Bell Beaker culture, also present in the Netherlands, apparently rose out of the Corded Ware culture.Lanting, J.N. & J.D. van der Waals, (1976), \"Beaker culture relations in the Lower Rhine Basin\", , in Lanting et al. (Eds) Glockenbechersimposion Oberried 1974. Bussum-Haarlem: Uniehoek N.V. \n\nCopper finds show that there was trade with other areas in Europe, as natural copper is not found in Dutch soil. The Bronze Age probably started somewhere around 2000 BC and lasted until around 800 BC. The many finds in Drenthe of rare and valuable objects, suggest that it was a trading centre in the Bronze Age. The Bell Beaker cultures (2700–2100 BC) locally developed into the Bronze Age Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100–1800 BC). In the second millennium BC, the region was the boundary between the Atlantic and Nordic horizons, roughly divided by the course of the Rhine. In the north, the Elp culture (c. 1800 BC to 800 BC)  was a Bronze Age archaeological culture having earthenware pottery of low quality as a marker. The initial phase was characterised by tumuli (1800–1200 BC) that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia, and were apparently related to the Tumulus culture (1600–1200 BC) in central Europe. This phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring Urnfield (cremation) burial customs (1200–800 BC). The southern region became dominated by the Hilversum culture (1800–800 BC), which apparently inherited cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.\n\nThe Iron Age brought a measure of prosperity. Iron ore was available throughout the country, including bog iron extracted from the ore in peat bogs in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the Veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant. Smiths travelled from small settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand, including axes, knives, pins, arrowheads and swords. Some evidence even suggests the making of Damascus steel swords using an advanced method of forging that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel. The King's grave of Oss dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound, the largest of its kind in western Europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral.\n\nGermanic groups and Romans (500 BC – 410 AD)\n\nThe deteriorating climate in Scandinavia around 850 BC, that further deteriorated around 650 BC, might have triggered migration of Germanic tribes from the North. By the time this migration was complete, around 250 BC, a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged.   The North Sea Germanic Ingvaeones (or Istvaeones) inhabited the northern part of the Low Countries. They would later develop into the Frisii and the early Saxons. A second grouping, the Weser-Rhine Germanic , extended along the middle Rhine and Weser and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers. This group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the Salian Franks. Also the Celtic La Tène culture (c. 450 BC up to the Roman conquest) had expanded over a wide range, including the southern area of the Low Countries. Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language, neither Germanic nor Celtic, survived in the Netherlands until the Roman period, the Iron Age Nordwestblock culture,   that eventually was being absorbed by the Celts to the south and the Germanic peoples from the east.\n\nDuring the Gallic Wars, the area south of the Oude Rijn and west of the Rhine was conquered by Roman forces under Julius Caesar from 57 BC to 53 BC. Caesar describes two main tribes living in what is now the southern Netherlands: the Menapii and the Eburones. The Rhine became fixed as Rome's northern frontier around 12 AD. Notable towns would arise along the Limes Germanicus: Nijmegen and Voorburg. At first part of Gallia Belgica, the area south of the Limes became part of the Roman province of Germania Inferior. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the Frisii, remained outside Roman rule (but not its presence and control), while the border tribes Batavi and Cananefates served in the Roman cavalry.  The Batavi rose against the Romans in the Batavian rebellion of 69AD, but were eventually defeated. The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks, whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century.  Salian Franks appear in Roman texts as both allies and enemies. The Salian Franks were forced by the confederation of the Saxons from the east to move over the Rhine into Roman territory in the fourth century. From their new base in West Flanders and the Southwest Netherlands, they were raiding the English Channel. Roman forces pacified the region, but did not expel the Franks, who continued to be feared at least until the time of Julian the Apostate (358), when Salian Franks were allowed to settle as foederati in Toxandria. After deteriorating climate conditions and the Romans withdrawal, the Frisii disappeared from the northern Netherlands, probably forced to resettle within Roman territory as laeti in c. 296. Coastal lands remained largely unpopulated for the next two centuries. \n\nEarly Middle Ages (411–1000)\n\nAfter Roman government in the area collapsed, the Franks expanded their territories in numerous kingdoms. By the 490s, Clovis I had conquered and united all these territories in the southern Netherlands in one Frankish kingdom, and from there continued his conquests into Gaul. During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the Vulgar Latin of the local population. A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north (i.e. southern Netherlands and Flanders), who kept on speaking Old Frankish, which by the ninth century had evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch. A Dutch-French language boundary came into existence. \n\nTo the north of the Franks, climatic conditions on the coast improved, and during the Migration Period the abandoned land was resettled again, mostly by Saxons, but also by the closely related Angles, Jutes and ancient Frisii.  Many moved on to England and came to be known as Anglo-Saxons, but those who stayed would be referred to as Frisians and their language as Frisian, named after the land that was once inhabited by Frisii. Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast, and it is still the closest to English related living language on continental Europe. By the seventh century a Frisian Kingdom (650–734) under King Aldegisel and King Redbad emerged with Utrecht as its centre of power,  while Dorestad was a flourishing trading place.   Between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks. In 734, at the Battle of the Boarn, the Frisians were defeated after a series of wars. With the approval of the Franks, the Anglo-Saxon missionary Willibrord converted the Frisian people to Christianity. He established the Archdiocese of Utrecht and became bishop of the Frisians. However, his successor Boniface was murdered by the Frisians in Dokkum, in 754.\n\nThe Frankish Carolingian empire modeled itself after the Roman Empire and controlled much of Western Europe. However, as of 843, it was divided into three parts—East, Middle, and West Francia. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of Middle Francia, which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprises territories from Frisia in the north to the Kingdom of Italy in the south. When the middle kingdom was partitioned, the lands north of the Alps passed to Lothair II and consecutively were named Lotharingia. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into Upper and Lower Lotharingia, the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of East Francia in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless Frisian and Frankish towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 850, Lothair I acknowledged the Viking Rorik of Dorestad as ruler of most of Frisia.  Around 879, another Viking raided the Frisian lands, Godfrid, Duke of Frisia. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that lay the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was Gerolf of Holland, who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.\n\nHigh Middle Ages (1000–1384)\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire (the successor state of East Francia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms, that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. Holland, Hainaut, Flanders, Gelre, Brabant, and the Utrecht were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally Frisian. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became Old Low Franconian (or Old Dutch). The rest of Frisia in the north (now Friesland and Groningen) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the \"Frisian freedom\") and resented the imposition of the feudal system.\n\nAround 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around monasteries and castles, and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign. In practice, this meant that Brugge and Antwerp became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\nAround 1100 AD, farmers from Flanders and Utrecht began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, and made the emergence of the County of Holland as center of power possible. The title of Count of Holland were fought over in the Hook and Cod Wars () between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy – who was also Count of Flanders – to conquer Holland.\n\nBurgundian and Habsburg Netherlands (1384–1581)\n\nMost of the Imperial and French fiefs in what is now the Netherlands and Belgium were united in a personal union by Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy in 1433. The House of Valois-Burgundy and their Habsburg heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the County of Holland defeated the fleets of the Hanseatic League several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\nUnder Habsburg Charles V, ruler of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain, all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the Seventeen Provinces, which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, the Eighty Years' War between the Provinces and their Spanish ruler began. In 1579, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the Union of Utrecht in which they committed to support each other in their defence against the Spanish army.  The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands. In 1581, the northern provinces adopted the Act of Abjuration, the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed Philip II of Spain as reigning monarch in the northern provinces. \n\nThe Protestant Queen Elizabeth I of England sympathised with the Dutch struggle against the Spanish, and sent an army of 7,600 soldiers to aid the Dutch in their war with the Catholic Spanish.  The English army under command of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester was of no real benefit to the Dutch rebellion.  Philip II, the son of Charles V, was not prepared to let them go easily, and war continued until 1648, when Spain under King Philip IV finally recognised the independence of the seven north-western provinces in the Peace of Münster. Parts of the southern provinces became de facto colonies of the new republican-mercantile empire.\n\nDutch Republic (1581–1795)\n\nAfter declaring their independence, the provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Groningen, Friesland, Utrecht, Overijssel, and Gelderland formed a confederation. All these duchies, lordships and counties were autonomous and had their own government, the States-Provincial. The States General, the confederal government, were seated in The Hague and consisted of representatives from each of the seven provinces. The sparsely populated region of Drenthe was part of the republic too, although it was not considered one of the provinces. Moreover, the Republic had come to occupy during the Eighty Years' War a number of so-called Generality Lands in Flanders, Brabant and Limburg. Their population was mainly Roman Catholic, and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own, and were used as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Spanish-controlled Southern Netherlands.\n\nIn the Dutch Golden Age, spanning much of the 17th century, the Dutch Empire grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers. Science, military, and art (especially painting) were among the most acclaimed in the world. By 1650, the Dutch owned 16,000 merchant ships.  The Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company established colonies and trading posts all over the world, including ruling the northern parts of Taiwan between 1624–1662 and 1664–1667. The Dutch settlement in North America began with the founding of New Amsterdam on the southern part of Manhattan in 1614. In South Africa, the Dutch settled the Cape Colony in 1652. Dutch colonies in South America were established along the many rivers in the fertile Guyana plains, among them Colony of Surinam (now Suriname). In Asia, the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and the only western trading post in Japan, Dejima.\n\nMany economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country in the world. In early modern Europe it had the wealthiest trading city (Amsterdam) and the first full-time stock exchange. The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boom-bust cycle, the world's first asset-inflation bubble, the tulip mania of 1636–1637, and the world's first bear raider, Isaac le Maire, who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount.  The republic went into a state of general decline in the later 18th century, with economic competition from England and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society, the republican Staatsgezinden and the supporters of the stadtholder the Prinsgezinden, as main political factions.\n\nBatavian Republic and kingdom (1795–1890)\n\nWith the armed support of revolutionary France, Dutch republicans proclaimed the Batavian Republic, modelled after the French Republic and rendering the Netherlands a unitary state on 19 January 1795. The stadtholder William V of Orange had fled to England. But from 1806 to 1810, the Kingdom of Holland was set up by Napoleon Bonaparte as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother Louis Bonaparte to control the Netherlands more effectively. However, King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother's, and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810. The Emperor sent in an army and the Netherlands became part of the French Empire until the autumn of 1813, when Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of Leipzig. William Frederick, son of the last stadtholder, returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and proclaimed himself Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands. Two years later, the Congress of Vienna added the southern Netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of France. William Frederick raised this United Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself King William I. In addition, William became hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg in exchange for his German possessions. However, the Southern Netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581, and rebelled. The south gained independence in 1830 as Belgium, while the personal union between Luxembourg and the Netherlands was severed in 1890, when William III died with no surviving male heirs. Ascendancy laws prevented his daughter Queen Wilhelmina from becoming the next Grand Duchess.\n\nThe Belgian Revolution at home and the Java War in the Dutch East Indies brought the Netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy. However, the Cultivation System was introduced in 1830; in the Dutch East Indies, 20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export. The policy brought the Dutch enormous wealth and made the colony self-sufficient. On the other hand, the colonies in the West Indies (Dutch Guiana and Curaçao and Dependencies), relied heavily on African slaves in which the Dutch part is estimated at 5–7 percent, or more than half a million Africans. The Netherlands abolished slavery in 1863.  Furthermore, slaves in Suriname would be fully free only in 1873, since the law stipulated that there was to be a mandatory 10-year transition.  The Dutch were also one of the last European countries to industrialise, in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nWorld wars and beyond (1890–present)\n\nThe Netherlands were able to remain neutral during World War I. In part, because the import of goods through the Netherlands proved essential to German survival, until the blockade by the British Royal Navy in 1916.  That changed in World War II, when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. The Rotterdam Blitz forced the main element of the Dutch army to surrender four days later. During the occupation, over 100,000 Dutch Jews  were rounded up and transported to Nazi extermination camps of whom only a few survived. Dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in Germany, civilians who resisted were killed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers, and the countryside was plundered for food. Although there were thousands of Dutch who risked their lives by hiding Jews from the Germans, over 20,000 Dutch fascists joined the Waffen SS,  fighting on the Eastern Front.  Political collaborators were members of the fascist NSB, the only legal political party in the occupied Netherlands. On 8 December 1941, the Dutch government-in-exile in London declared war on Japan,  but could not prevent the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia).  In 1944–45, the First Canadian Army, which included Canadian, British and Polish troops, was responsible for liberating much of the Netherlands.  But soon after VE day, the Dutch fought a colonial war against the new republic of Indonesia.\n\nIn 1954, the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands reformed the political structure of the Netherlands, which was a result of international pressure to carry out decolonisation. The Dutch colonies of Surinam and Curaçao and Dependencies and the European country all became countries within the Kingdom, on a basis of equality. Indonesia had declared its independence in August 1945 (recognised in 1949), and thus was never part of the reformed Kingdom. Suriname followed in 1975. After the war the Netherlands left behind also an era of neutrality and gained closer ties with neighboring states. The Netherlands was one of the founding members of the Benelux, the NATO, Euratom and the European Coal and Steel Community, which would evolve into the EEC (Common Market) and later the European Union.\n\nGovernment-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500,000 Dutch people to leave the country after the war.  The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid ontzuiling (literally: depillarisation), a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines. Youths, and students in particular, rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as women's rights, sexuality, disarmament and environmental issues. On 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved. Referendums were held on each island to determine their future status. As a result, the islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (the BES islands) were to obtain closer ties with the Netherlands. This led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the Netherlands as special municipalities upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. The special municipalities are collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands.\n\nGeography\n\nThe European area of the Netherlands lies between latitudes 50° and 54° N, and longitudes 3° and 8° E.\n\nThe Netherlands is geographically a very low and flat country, with about 26% of its area  and 21% of its population located below sea level, and only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre above sea level. The country is for the most part flat, with the exception of foothills in the far southeast, up to a height of no more than 321 metres, and some low hill ranges in the central parts. Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by peat extraction or achieved through land reclamation. Since the late 16th century, large polder areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes, canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.\n\nMuch of the country was originally formed by the estuaries of three large European rivers: the Rhine (Rijn), the Meuse (Maas) and the Scheldt (Schelde), as well as their tributaries. The south-western part of the Netherlands is to this day a river delta of these three rivers, the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta.\n \nThe Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the Waal, its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between fiefdoms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their \"Great Rivers\" (de Grote Rivieren). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the IJssel river, discharges into Lake IJssel, the former Zuiderzee ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak Dutch Low Saxon dialects (except for the province of Friesland, which has its own language). \n\nFloods\n\nOver the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention. Most notable in terms of land loss was the storm of 1134, which created the archipelago of Zeeland in the south-west.\n\nOn 14 December 1287, St. Lucia's flood affected the Netherlands and Germany killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.  The St. Elizabeth flood of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder, replacing it with the 72 km2 Biesbosch tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The huge North Sea flood of early February 1953 caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the \"Delta Works\", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.\n\nThe impact of disasters was to an extent increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying swampland was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.\n\nBecause of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century. \n\nTo guard against floods, a series of defences against the water were contrived. In the first millennium AD, villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called terps. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called \"waterschappen\" (\"water boards\") or \"hoogheemraadschappen\" (\"high home councils\") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century windmills had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous polders.\n\nIn 1932 the Afsluitdijk (\"Closure Dike\") was completed, blocking the former Zuiderzee (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the IJsselmeer (IJssel Lake). It became part of the larger Zuiderzee Works in which four polders totalling 2500 km2 were reclaimed from the sea.  \n\nThe Netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from climate change. Not only is the rising sea a problem, but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow.   \n\nDelta works\n\nAfter the 1953 disaster, the Delta Works were constructed, a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast. The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the Maeslantkering. New projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the Delta Works. A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country). This was achieved by raising 3000 km of outer sea-dykes and 10000 km of inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea estuaries of the Zeeland province. New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dyke reinforcements. The Delta project is considered by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world. \n\nIt is anticipated that global warming in the 21st century will result in a rise in sea level which, despite popular belief, will possibly not overwhelm the measures the Netherlands has taken to control floods. Even more specifically, the Netherlands is the only country in the world actively preparing for a sea level rise. A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of  and a simultaneous land height decline of 10 cm. The plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defenses like dikes and dunes with  of additional flood protection. Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the sea side, but could also alter rain fall patterns and river run-off. To protect the country from river flooding, another program is already being executed. The Room for the River plan grants more flow space to rivers, protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands. The few residents who lived in these so-called \"overflow areas\" have been moved to higher ground, with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels.\n\nProtecting the country against floods is one element of climate change. The other is that the pressure of the sea water on ground water will increase. As a result, the fresh water table will be pushed more inland, resulting in more brackish or saline groundwater in the coastal provinces. Due to this change, some drinking water areas will be forced to apply desalination despite the apparent abundance of water. It will also affect agriculture. The greenhouses can continue their production by becoming more water efficient (they are already disconnected from the groundwater, thereby not becoming more saline), though they will need to become more energy and water efficient. The push of more brackish water into the mainland will also cause changes in flora and fauna.\n\nClimate\n\nThe predominant wind direction in the Netherlands is southwest, which causes a moderate maritime climate, with cool summers and mild winters, and typically high humidity. This is especially true close to the Dutch coastline, where the difference in temperature between summer and winter, as well as between day and night is noticeably smaller than it is in the southeast of the country.\n\nThe following tables are based on mean measurements by the KNMI weather station in De Bilt between 1981 and 2010:\n\nIce days (maximum temperature below 0 C) usually occur from December until February, with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period. Freezing days (minimum temperature below 0 C) occur much more often, usually ranging from mid-November to late March, but not rarely measured as early as mid-October and as late as mid-May. If one chooses the height of measurement to be 10 cm above ground instead of 150 cm, one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer. On average, snow can occur from November to April, but sometimes occurs in May or October too.\n\nWarm days (maximum temperature above 20 C) in De Bilt are usually found in April to October, but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March, or even sometimes in November or February (usually not in De Bilt, however). Summer days (maximum temperature above 25 C) are usually measured in De Bilt from May until September, tropical days (maximum temperature above 30 C) are rare and usually occur only in June to August.\n\nPrecipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month. Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer, when lightning is also much more frequent).\n\nThe number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.\n\nNature\n\nThe Netherlands has 20 national parks and hundreds of other nature reserves, that include lakes, heathland, woods, dunes and other habitats. Most of these are owned by Staatsbosbeheer, the national department for forestry and nature conservation and Natuurmonumenten (literally 'Natures monuments'), a private organisation that buys, protects and manages nature reserves. The Dutch part of the Wadden Sea in the north, with its tidal flats and wetlands, is rich in biological diversity, and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Nature Site in 2009.\n\nThe Oosterschelde, formerly the northeast estuary of the river Scheldt was designated a national park in 2002, thereby making it the largest national park in the Netherlands at an area of 370 km2. It consists primarily of the salt waters of the Oosterschelde, but also includes mud flats, meadows, and shoals. Because of the large variety of sea life, including unique regional species, the park is popular with Scuba divers. Other activities include sailing, fishing, cycling, and bird watching.\n\nPhytogeographically, the Netherlands is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of the Netherlands belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests. In 1871, the last old original natural woods were cut down, and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like Scots pine and trees that are not native to the Netherlands. These woods were planted on anthropogenic heaths and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) (Veluwe).\n\nCaribbean islands\n\nThe Caribbean Netherlands are designated as special municipalities of the Netherlands. The islands form a part of the Lesser Antilles. Within this island group,\n\n* Bonaire is part of the ABC islands within the Leeward Antilles island chain off the Venezuelan coast. The Leeward Antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin.\n* Saba and Sint Eustatius are part of the SSS islands. They are located east of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Although in the English language they are considered part of the Leeward Islands, French, Spanish, Dutch and the English spoken locally consider them part of the Windward Islands. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for agriculture. The highest point is Mount Scenery, 887 m, on Saba. This is the highest point in the country, and is also the highest point of the entire Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nThe islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a tropical climate with warm weather all year round. The Leeward Antilles are warmer and drier than the Windward islands. In summer, the Windward Islands can be subject to hurricanes.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Netherlands has been a constitutional monarchy since 1815 and a parliamentary democracy since 1848. The Netherlands is described as a consociational state. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2010, The Economist ranked the Netherlands as the 10th most democratic country in the world.\nThe monarch is the head of state, at present King Willem-Alexander. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers.  By law, the king (the title queen has no constitutional significance) has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs. Depending on the personalities and relationships of the king and the ministers, the king might have influence beyond the power granted by the constitution.\n\nThe executive power is formed by the council of Ministers, the deliberative council of the Dutch cabinet. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of state secretaries. One to three ministers are ministers without portfolio. The head of government is the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a primus inter pares, with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. Mark Rutte has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.\n\nThe cabinet is responsible to the bicameral parliament, the States General, which also has legislative powers. The 150 members of the House of Representatives, the Lower House, are elected in direct elections on the basis of party-list proportional representation. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a motion of no confidence, the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The States-Provincial are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the Senate, the upper house, which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them.\n\nPolitical culture\n\nBoth trade unions and employers organisations are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with government in the Social-Economic Council. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long tradition of social tolerance. In the 18th century, while the Dutch Reformed Church was the state religion, Catholicism, other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, and Judaism were tolerated but discriminated against.\n\nIn the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation, in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch criminal justice policies on recreational drugs, prostitution, LGBT rights, euthanasia, and abortion, which are among the most liberal in the world.\n\nPolitical parties\n\nBecause of the multi-party system, no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century, and coalition cabinets had to be formed. Since suffrage became universal in 1919, the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the Christian democrats, currently represented by the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA); second were the social democrats, represented by the Labour Party (PvdA); and third were the liberals, of which the right wing People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is the main representative.\n\nThese parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian democrats and social democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian democrats and liberals. In the 1970s, the party system became more volatile: the Christian democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal D66.\n\nIn the 1994 election, the CDA lost its dominant position. A \"purple\" cabinet was formed by VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the 2002 elections, this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right LPF, a new political party, around Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived cabinet was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende. After the 2003 elections, in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a cabinet was formed by CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the welfare state, the healthcare system, and immigration policy.\n\nIn June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the Minister of Immigration and Integration, Rita Verdonk, who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a VVD MP. A caretaker cabinet was formed by CDA and VVD, and general elections were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the Socialist Party made the largest gains. The formation of a new cabinet took three months, resulting in a coalition of CDA, PvdA, and ChristianUnion.\n\nOn 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in Uruzgan, Afghanistan.  Snap elections were held on 9 June 2010, with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats. The VVD became the largest party with 31 seats, closely followed by the PvdA with 30 seats. The big winner of the 2010 elections was Geert Wilders, whose right wing PVV,   the ideological successor to the LPF, more than doubled its number of seats.  Negotiation talks for a new government resulted in a minority government, led by VVD (a first) in coalition with CDA, which was sworn in on 14 October 2010. This unprecedented minority government was supported by PVV, but proved ultimately to be unstable,  when on 21 April 2012, Wilders, leader of PVV, unexpectedly 'torpedoed seven weeks of austerity talks' on new austerity measures, paving the way for early elections.   \n\nVVD and PvdA were the big winners of the elections. Since 5 November 2012 they have formed the second Rutte cabinet.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nThe Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces, each under a Commissioner of the King (Commissaris van de Koning), except for Limburg province where the position is named Governor (Gouverneur). All provinces are divided into municipalities (gemeenten), of which there are 390 (2016).\n\nThe country is also subdivided into 24 water districts, governed by a water board (waterschap or hoogheemraadschap), each having authority in matters concerning water management. The creation of water boards actually pre-dates that of the nation itself, the first appearing in 1196. The Dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence. Direct elections of the water boards take place every 4 years.\n\nThe administrative structure on the 3 BES islands, collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands, is different. These islands have the status of openbare lichamen (public bodies) rather than municipalities and as administrative units are generally referred to as special municipalities. They are not part of a province.\n\nForeign relations\n\nThe history of Dutch foreign policy has been characterised by its neutrality. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, NATO and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on international trade.\n\nThe foreign policy of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to Atlantic co-operation, to European integration, to international development and to international law. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs.\n\nDuring and after the Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day Suriname and Indonesia. Indonesia became independent after the Indonesian National Revolution in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several UN Security Council Resolutions. Surinam became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands.\n\nMilitary\n\nThe Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by Maurice of Nassau. The Dutch army was used throughout the Dutch Empire. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a conscription army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the Belgian Revolution in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the Netherlands was invaded in World War II and quickly defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.\n\nThe Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the Treaty of Brussels, and became a founding member of NATO in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in Cold War Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division of the United States Army during the Korean War. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the Bosnian War and the Kosovo War, it held a province in Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein, and it was engaged in Afghanistan.\n\nThe military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix Koninklijke (Royal):\n\n* Koninklijke Landmacht (KL), the Royal Netherlands Army\n* Koninklijke Marine (KM), the Royal Netherlands Navy, including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps\n* Koninklijke Luchtmacht (KLu), the Royal Netherlands Air Force\n* Koninklijke Marechaussee (KMar), the Royal Marechaussee (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control\n\nGeneral Tom Middendorp is the current Commander of the Netherlands armed forces.\nAll military specialities except the submarine service and the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps (Korps Mariniers) are open to women. The Korps Commandotroepen, the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for women to become a commando.  The Dutch Ministry of Defence employs more than 70,000 personnel, including over 20,000 civilians and over 50,000 military personnel.  In April 2011 the government announced a major reduction in its military because of a cut in government expenditure, including a decrease in the number of tanks, fighter aircraft, naval ships and senior officials. \n\nEconomy\n\nThe Netherlands has a developed economy and has been playing a special role in the European economy for many centuries. Since the 16th century, shipping, fishing, agriculture, trade, and banking have been leading sectors of the Dutch economy. The Netherlands has a high level of economic freedom. The Netherlands is one of the top countries in the Global Enabling Trade Report (3rd in 2014).\n\n, the key trading partners of the Netherlands were Germany, Belgium, UK, United States, France, Italy, China and Russia.  The Netherlands is one of the world's 10 leading exporting countries. Foodstuffs form the largest industrial sector. Other major industries include chemicals, metallurgy, machinery, electrical goods, and tourism (in 2012 the Netherlands welcomed 11.7 million international tourists). Examples of international companies operating in Netherlands include Randstad, Unilever, Heineken, KLM, financial services (ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank), chemicals (DSM, AKZO), petroleum refining (Shell), electronical machinery (Philips, ASML), and car navigation (TomTom).\n\nThe Netherlands has the 17th-largest economy in the world, and ranks 10th in GDP (nominal) per capita. Between 1997 and 2000 annual economic growth (GDP) averaged nearly 4%, well above the European average. Growth slowed considerably from 2001 to 2005 with the global economic slowdown, but accelerated to 4.1% in the third quarter of 2007. In May 2013, inflation was at 2.8% per year.  In April 2013, unemployment was at 8.2% (or 6.7% following the ILO definition) of the labour force.In April 2016 this was reduced to 6.3%  \n\nIn Q3 and Q4 2011, the Dutch economy contracted by 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively, because of European Debt Crisis, while in Q4 the Eurozone economy shrunk by 0.3%.  The Netherlands also has a relatively low GINI coefficient of 0.326. Despite ranking 7th in GDP per capita, UNICEF ranked the Netherlands 1st in child well-being.  On the Index of Economic Freedom Netherlands is the 13th most free market capitalist economy out of 157 surveyed countries.\n\nAmsterdam is the financial and business capital of the Netherlands.  The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX), part of Euronext, is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe's largest bourses. It is situated near Dam Square in the city's centre. As a founding member of the euro, the Netherlands replaced (for accounting purposes) its former currency, the \"gulden\" (guilder), on 1 January 1999, along with 15 other adopters of the euro. Actual euro coins and banknotes followed on 1 January 2002. One euro was equivalent to 2.20371 Dutch guilders. In the Caribbean Netherlands, the United States dollar is used instead of the euro.\n\nThe Dutch location gives it prime access to markets in the UK and Germany, with the port of Rotterdam being the largest port in Europe. Other important parts of the economy are international trade (Dutch colonialism started with co-operative private enterprises such as the VOC), banking and transport. The Netherlands successfully addressed the issue of public finances and stagnating job growth long before its European partners. Amsterdam is the 5th-busiest tourist destination in Europe with more than 4.2 million international visitors.  Since the enlargement of the EU large numbers of migrant workers have arrived in the Netherlands from central and eastern Europe. \n\nOf economic importance is BrabantStad, a partnership between the municipalities of Breda, Eindhoven, Helmond, 's-Hertogenbosch and Tilburg and the province of North Brabant. BrabantStad is the fastest growing economic region in the Netherlands, with Brainport as one of the three national top regions and as a top region in the world. The region lies within the Eindhoven-Leuven-Aachen Triangle (ELAT).  The partnership aims to form an urban network and to make North Brabant explicitly known as a leading knowledge region within Europe. With a total of 1.5 million people and 20% of the industrial production in the Netherlands is BrabantStad one of the major economical important, metropolitan regions of the Netherlands. Of all the money that goes to research and development in the Netherlands, one third is spent in Eindhoven. A quarter of the jobs in the region are in technology and ICT. \n\nOf all European patent applications in the field of physics and electronics about eight per cent is from North Brabant.  In the extended region, BrabantStad is part of the Eindhoven-Leuven-Aachen Triangle (ELAT). This economic cooperation agreement between three cities in three countries has created one of the most innovative regions in the European Union (measured in terms of money invested in technology and knowledge economy).  The economic success of this region is important for the international competitiveness of the Netherlands; Together Amsterdam (airport), Rotterdam (seaport), and Eindhoven (Brainport) form the foundation of the Dutch economy. \n\nThe Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States. The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment. The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007. The Netherlands is the fifth-most competitive economy in the world, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report. \n\nApart from coal and gas, the country has no mining resources. The last coal mine was closed in 1974. The Groningen gas field, one of the largest natural gas fields in the world, is situated near Slochteren. Exploitation of this field has resulted in €159 billion in revenue since the mid-1970s.  The field is operated by government-owned Gasunie and output is jointly exploited by the government, Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil through NAM (Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij). \"Gas extraction has resulted in increasingly strong earth tremors, some measuring as much as 3.6 on the Richter scale. The cost of damage repairs, structural improvements to buildings, and compensation for home value decreases has been estimated at 6.5 billion euros. Around 35,000 homes are said to be affected.\" \n\nAgriculture\n\nThe Dutch agricultural sector is highly mechanised, and has a strong focus on international exports. It employs about 4% of the Dutch labour force but produces large surpluses for the food-processing industry and accounts for 21 percent of the Dutch total export value.  The Dutch rank second worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind only the United States, with exports earning €80.7 billion in 2014,  up from €75.4 billion in 2012.\n\nThe Netherlands has, at some time in recent history, supplied one quarter of all of the world's exported tomatoes, and trade of one-third of the world's exports of chilis, tomatoes and cucumbers goes through the country. The Netherlands also exports one-fifteenth of the world's apples.\n\nAside from that, a significant portion of Dutch agricultural exports consists of fresh-cut plants, flowers, and flower bulbs, with the Netherlands exporting two-thirds of the world's total. \n\nTransport\n\nMobility on Dutch roads has grown continuously since the 1950s and now exceeds 200 billion km travelled per year,  three quarters of which are done by car.  Around half of all trips in the Netherlands are made by car, 25% by bicycle, 20% walking, and 5% by public transport. With a total road network of 139,295 km, which includes 2,758 km of expressways,  the Netherlands has one of the densest road networks in the world—much denser than Germany and France, but still not as dense as Belgium.\n\nAbout 13% of all distance is travelled by public transport, the majority of which by train. Like in many other European countries, the Dutch rail network of 3,013 route km is also rather dense.  The network is mostly focused on passenger rail services and connects virtually all major towns and cities. Trains are frequent, with one or two trains per hour on lesser lines, two to four trains per hour on average, and up to eight trains an hour on the busiest lines.\n\nCycling is a ubiquitous mode of transport in the Netherlands. Almost as many kilometres are covered by bicycle as by train. The Dutch are estimated to have at least 18 million bicycles,[http://www.hollandtrade.com/media/features/feature-stories/?bstnum\n4960 Holland Publications | Newsroom | Holland Trade and Invest]  which makes more than one per capita, and twice as many as the c. 9 million motor vehicles on the road.  In 2013, the European Cyclists' Federation ranked both the Netherlands and Denmark as the most bike-friendly countries in Europe,  but more of the Dutch (31%) than of the Danes (19%) list the bike as their main mode of transport for daily activities.   Cycling infrastructure is comprehensive. Busy roads have received some 35,000 km of dedicated cycle tracks, physically segregated from motorised traffic.  Busy junctions are often equipped with bicycle-specific traffic lights. There are large bicycle parking facilities, particularly in city centres and at train stations.\n\nRotterdam has the largest port in Europe, with the rivers Meuse and Rhine providing excellent access to the hinterland upstream reaching to Basel, Switzerland, and into France. , Rotterdam was the world's eighth largest container port handling 440.5 million metric tonnes of cargo annually.  The port's main activities are petrochemical industries and general cargo handling and transshipment. The harbour functions as an important transit point for bulk materials and between the European continent and overseas. From Rotterdam goods are transported by ship, river barge, train or road. In 2007, the Betuweroute, a new fast freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany, was completed.\n\nSchiphol airport, just southwest of Amsterdam, is the main international airport in the Netherlands, and the fifth busiest airport in Europe in terms of passengers.\n\nAs part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 recharging stations for electric vehicles across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by Switzerland-based power and automation company ABB and Dutch startup Fastned, and will aim to provide at least one station within a 50-kilometre radius (30 miles) from every home in the Netherlands. \n\nDemographics\n\nThe Netherlands had an estimated population of 16,785,403 on 30 April 2013.  It is the 10th most populous country in Europe and the 63rd most populous country in the world. Between 1900 and 1950, the country's population almost doubled from 5.1 to 10 million. From 1950 to 2000, the population further increased, to 15.9 million, though this represented a lower rate of population growth.  The estimated growth rate  is 0.44%. \n\nThe fertility rate in the Netherlands is 1.78 children per woman (2013 est), which is high compared with many other European countries, but below the rate of 2.1 children per woman required for natural population replacement. Life expectancy is high in the Netherlands: 83.21 years for newborn girls and 78.93 for boys (2013 est). The country has a migration rate of 1.99 migrants per 1,000 inhabitants per year.\n\nThe majority of the population of the Netherlands is ethnically Dutch. According to a 2005 estimate, the population was 80.9% Dutch, 2.4% Indonesian, 2.4% German, 2.2% Turkish, 2.0% Surinamese, 1.9% Moroccan, 0.8% Antillean and Aruban, and 7.4% others.  Some 150,000 to 200,000 people living in the Netherlands are expatriates, mostly concentrated in and around Amsterdam and The Hague, now constituting almost 10% of the population of these cities.  \n\nThe Dutch are the tallest people in the world,  with an average height of  for adult males and  for adult females in 2009.  People in the south are on average about 2 cm shorter than those in the north.\n\nDutch people, or descendants of Dutch people, are also found in migrant communities worldwide, notably in Canada, Australia, South Africa and the United States. According to the 2006 US Census, more than 5 million Americans claim total or partial Dutch ancestry.  There are close to 3 million Dutch-descended Afrikaners living in South Africa.  In 1940, there were 290,000 Europeans and Eurasians in Indonesia,  but most have since left the country.  According to Eurostat, in 2010 there were 1.8 million foreign-born residents in the Netherlands, corresponding to 11.1% of the total population. Of these, 1.4 million (8.5%) were born outside the EU and 0.428 million (2.6%) were born in another EU Member State. \n\nThe Netherlands is the 24th most densely populated country in the world, with  or – if only the land area is counted (33883 km2) – .  When the land area of the provinces only is counted (33718 km2), a number of 500 PD/sqkm was reached in the first half of 2014. The Randstad is the country's largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam in the province North Holland, Rotterdam and The Hague in the province South Holland, and Utrecht in the province Utrecht. The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe. According to Dutch Central Statistics Bureau, in 2015, 28 percent of Dutch population had a spendable income above 40 thousand EUR. \n\nLanguage\n\nThe official language is Dutch, which is spoken by the vast majority of the inhabitants. Besides Dutch, West Frisian is recognised as a second official language in the northern province of Friesland (Fryslân in West Frisian).  West Frisian has a formal status for government correspondence in that province. In the European part of the Netherlands two other regional languages are recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. \n\nThe first of these regional languages is Low Saxon (Nedersaksisch in Dutch) is recognised. Low Saxon consists of several dialects spoken in the north and east, like Twents in the region of Twente, and Drents in the province of Drenthe. Secondly, Limburgish is also recognised as a regional language. It consists of Dutch varieties of Meuse-Rhenish Franconian languages and is spoken in the south-eastern province of Limburg. The dialects most spoken in the Netherlands are the Brabantian-Hollandic dialects. \n\nRipuarian language, which is spoken in Kerkrade and Vaals in the form of, respectively, the Kerkrade dialect and the Vaals dialect   is not recognised as a regional language of the Netherlands.\n\nEnglish has a formal status in the special municipalities of Saba and Sint Eustatius. It is widely spoken on these islands. Papiamento has a formal status in the special municipality of Bonaire. Yiddish and the Romani language were recognised in 1996 as non-territorial languages. \n\nThe Netherlands has a tradition of learning foreign languages, formalised in Dutch education laws. Some 90% of the total population indicate they are able to converse in English, 70% in German, and 29% in French.  English is a mandatory course in all secondary schools. In most lower level secondary school educations (vmbo), one additional modern foreign language is mandatory during the first two years. \n\nIn higher level secondary schools (havo and vwo), two additional modern foreign languages are mandatory during the first three years. Only during the last three years in vwo one foreign language is mandatory. Besides English, the standard modern languages are French and German, although schools can replace one of these modern languages with Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, or Russian. Additionally, schools in the Frisia region teach and have exams in Frisian, and schools across the country teach and have exams in classical Greek and Latin for secondary school (called gymnasium or vwo+).\n\nReligion\n\nHistorically, the Netherlands was a predominantly Christian society. From the onset of the Protestant Reformation, the Dutch population became divided into about two-thirds Protestant (mostly Reformed) and one-third Roman Catholic believers.For detailed statistics, see Statistics by the Dutch Centraal Bureau van de Statistiek. This began to change gradually in the 20th centuryThe religious development of the Netherlands in the 20th century, and its three defining censuses: The census of 31 December 1930 recorded various Protestants at 46.3%, Roman Catholics at 36.5% and the remainder at 17.2%. The census of 31 May 1947 recorded various Protestants at 42.3%, Roman Catholics at 38.6% and the remainder at 19.1%. The census of 31 May 1960 recorded various Protestants at 40.7%, Roman Catholics at 40.5% and the remainder at 18.8%. as there has been a steep decline in religious adherence, which continues. There was a strong religious difference between the Roman Catholic south and the Reformed north, remains of which are still in evidence. The Netherlands is currently one of the most secular countries in the world. About 39% of the population is religiously affiliated and in 2010 fewer than 5.6% visited religious services regularly (once or more per month). In spite of an overall decline in religiosity, a countervailing trend is the religious revival in the Protestant Bible Belt, and the growth of Muslim and Hindu communities.  \n\nReligion in the Netherlands is generally considered a personal matter and is not supposed to be propagated in public.   \nThe Dutch constitution guarantees freedom of education, which means that all schools that adhere to general quality criteria receive the same government funding. This includes schools based on religious principles  by religious groups (especially Roman Catholic and various Protestant). Three political parties in the Dutch parliament (CDA, ChristianUnion, and SGP) are based upon the Christian belief. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost and the Ascension of Jesus). \n\nChristianity is currently the largest religion in the Netherlands, accounting for about one-third of the population. Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian religious grouping with around four million registered adherents (23.7% of the population).  The provinces of North Brabant and Limburg have historically been strongly Roman Catholic, and their people still largely consider the Catholic Church as a base for their cultural identity. Protestantism in the Netherlands consists of a number of churches within various traditions. The largest of these is the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN) (10.2% of the population), a United church which is Reformed and Lutheran in orientation.  It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and a smaller Lutheran Church. Several orthodox Reformed and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN. Although in the Netherlands as a whole Christianity has become a minority, the Netherlands contains a Bible Belt from Zeeland to the northern parts of the province Overijssel, in which Protestant (particularly Reformed) beliefs remain strong, and even has majorities in municipal councils. The Dutch Royal Family has historically been Reformed.\n \nIslam is the second largest religion in the state. In 2012, there were about 825,000 Muslims in the Netherlands (5% of the population). Muslim numbers increased from the 1960 as a consequence of large numbers of migrant workers. This included migrants from former Dutch colonies, such as Surinam and Indonesia, but mainly migrant workers from Turkey and Morocco. During the 1990s, Muslim refugees arrived from countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, and Afghanistan. \n\nOther religions account for some 6% of the Dutch people. Hinduism is a minority religion in the Netherlands, with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are Indo-Surinamese. There are also sizable populations of Hindu immigrants from India and Sri Lanka, and some Western adherents of Hinduism-oriented new religious movements such as Hare Krishnas. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 Buddhists or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people. There are about 45,000 Jews in the Netherlands.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation in the Netherlands is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16 when HAVO, VWO or MBO level 2 or higher completed or 18. \n\nAll children in the Netherlands usually attend elementary school from (on average) ages 4 to 12. It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the 8th grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education (after completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream):\n* The vmbo has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the mbo.\n** MBO (\"middle-level applied education\"). This form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade, or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO.\n* The havo has 5 grades and allows for admission to the hbo.\n** HBO (\"higher professional education\"), are universities of professional education (or applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. A HBO degrees gives access to the university system.\n* The vwo (comprising atheneum and gymnasium) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a (research) university.\n** Universities offer of a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one-, or two year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four-year doctoral degree program. Doctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university.\n\nHealthcare\n\nIn 2015 the Netherlands has maintained its number one position at the top of the annual Euro health consumer index (EHCI), which compares healthcare systems in Europe, scoring 916 of a maximum 1,000 points. The Netherlands has been in the top three countries in each report published since 2005. On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for the sixth year in a row.[http://www.healthpowerhouse.com Health Consumer Powerhouse]\nThe Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the health care systems of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.  \n\nEver since a major reform of the health care system in 2006, the Dutch system received more points in the Index each year. According to the HCP (Health Consumer Powerhouse), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. But the difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals. \n\nHealth insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:\n*Zorgverzekeringswet (Zvw), often called \"basic insurance\", covers common medical care. \n*Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care. While Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If you don't take out insurance, you risk a fine. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health – it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (huisartsen, comparable to General Practitioners) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.  The health care system is in comparison to other Western countries quite effective but not the most cost-effective.Boston Consulting Group, 'Zorg voor Waarde', 2011\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands is financed by a dual system that came into effect in January 2006. Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalization, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (\"General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs\") which first came into effect in 1968. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses. \n\nFor all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of obligatory health insurance, with private health insurance companies. These insurance companies are obliged to provide a package with a defined set of insured treatments.  This insurance covers 41% of all health care expenses. \n\nOther sources of health care payment are taxes (14%), out of pocket payments (9%), additional optional health insurance packages (4%) and a range of other sources (4%). Affordability is guaranteed through a system of income-related allowances and individual and employer-paid income-related premiums.\n\nA key feature of the Dutch system is that premiums may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through risk equalization and a common risk pool. Funding for all short-term health care is 50% from employers, 45% from the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about 100 € per month (about US$127 in Aug. 2010 and in 2012 €150 or US$196,) with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and deductible a year €220 US$288.\n\nCulture\n\nArt, philosophy and literature\n\nThe Netherlands has had many well-known painters. The 17th century, in which the Dutch Republic was prosperous, was the age of the \"Dutch Masters\", such as Rembrandt van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, Jan Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael and many others. Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were Vincent van Gogh and Piet Mondriaan. M. C. Escher is a well-known graphics artist. Willem de Kooning was born and trained in Rotterdam, although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist.\n\nThe Netherlands is the country of philosophers Erasmus of Rotterdam and Spinoza. All of Descartes' major work was done in the Netherlands. The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) discovered Saturn's moon Titan, argued that light travelled as waves, invented the pendulum clock and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe and describe single-celled organisms with a microscope.\n\nIn the Dutch Golden Age, literature flourished as well, with Joost van den Vondel and P. C. Hooft as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, Multatuli wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include Godfried Bomans, Harry Mulisch, Jan Wolkers, Simon Vestdijk, Hella S. Haasse, Cees Nooteboom, Gerard (van het) Reve and Willem Frederik Hermans. Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl was published after she died in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.\n\nThe traditional Dutch architecture is especially valuated in Amsterdam, Delft and Leiden, with 17 and 18th century buildings along the canals. Smaller village architecture with wooden houses is found in Zaandam and Marken. Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in Huis Ten Bosch, Nagasaki, Japan. A similar Holland Village is being built in Shenyang, China. Windmills, tulips, wooden shoes, cheese, Delftware pottery, and cannabis are among the items associated with the Netherlands by tourists.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and today is regarded as a liberal country, considering its drug policy and its legalisation of euthanasia. On 1 April 2001, the Netherlands became the first nation to legalise same-sex marriage. \n\nDutch value system and etiquette\n\nThe Dutch have a code of etiquette which governs social behaviour and is considered important. Because of the international position of the Netherlands, many books have been written on the subject. Some customs may not be true in all regions and they are never absolute. In addition to those specific to the Dutch, many general points of European etiquette apply to the Dutch as well.\n\nDutch society is egalitarian, individualistic and modern. The people tend to view themselves as modest, independent and self-reliant. They value ability over dependency. The Dutch have an aversion to the non-essential.\n\nOstentatious behaviour is to be avoided. Accumulating money is fine, but public spending of large amounts of money is considered something of a vice and associated with being a show-off. A high lifestyle is considered wasteful and suspect with most people. The Dutch are proud of their cultural heritage, rich history in art and involvement in international affairs.\n\nDutch manners are open and direct with a no-nonsense attitude; informality combined with adherence to basic behaviour. According to a humorous source on Dutch culture, Their directness gives many the impression that they are rude and crude—attributes they prefer to call 'openness. \n\nA well known more serious source on Dutch etiquette is \"Dealing with the Dutch\" from Jacob Vossestein: Dutch egalitarianism is the idea that people are equal, especially from a moral point of view, and accordingly, causes the somewhat ambiguous stance the Dutch have towards hierarchy and status.  As always, manners differ between groups. Asking about basic rules will not be considered impolite. What may strike you as being blatantly blunt topics and comments are no more embarrassing or unusual to the Dutch than discussing the weather.\n\nThe majority of the Dutch are irreligious and religion is in the Netherlands generally considered as a very personal matter which is not supposed to be propagated in public.\n\nDutch people and ecology\n\nThe Netherlands has the reputation of the leader country in environmental and population management.  In 2015, Amsterdam and Rotterdam where designed respectively at the 4th and the 5th on the Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index.  \n\nSustainability is a concept important for the Dutch. The goal of the Dutch Government is to have a sustainable, reliable and affordable energy system, by 2050, in which CO2 emissions have been halved and 40 percent of electricity is derived from sustainable sources. \n\nThe government is investing billions of euros in energy efficiency, sustainable energy and CO2 reduction. The Kingdom also encourage Dutch companies to build sustainable business/projects/facilities, with financial aids from the state to the companies or individuals who are active in making the country more sustainable.\n\nMusic\n\nThe Netherlands has multiple music traditions. Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as \"Levenslied\", meaning Song of life, to an extent comparable to a French Chanson or a German Schlager. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and refrains. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include love, death and loneliness. Traditional musical instruments such as the accordion and the barrel organ are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists also use synthesizers and guitars. Artists in this genre include Jan Smit, Frans Bauer and André Hazes.\n\nContemporary Dutch rock and pop music (Nederpop) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the United States and Britain. In the 1960s and 1970s the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as Shocking Blue, Golden Earring, Tee Set, George Baker Selection and Focus enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band Doe Maar. Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in either.\n\nCurrent symphonic metal bands Epica, Delain, ReVamp, The Gathering, Asrai, Autumn, Ayreon and Within Temptation as well as jazz / pop singer Caro Emerald are having international success. Also metalbands  like Legion of The Damned,Hail of Bullets, God Dethroned, Izegrim, Asphyx, The Charm the Fury, Textures, Present Danger, Heidevolk and Slechtvalk are populair guests at the biggest metalfestivals in Europe.  \nContemporary local heroes include pop singer Anouk, country pop singer Ilse DeLange, in South Guelderish dialect singing folk band Rowwen Hèze, rock band BLØF  and Dutch language duo Nick & Simon.\n\nEarly 1990s Dutch and Belgian house music came together in Eurodance project 2 Unlimited. Selling 18 million records,  the two singers in the band are the most successful Dutch music artists to this day. Tracks like \"Get Ready for This\" are still popular themes of U.S. sports events, like the NHL. In the mid 1990s Dutch language rap and hip hop (Nederhop) also came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. Artists with North African, Caribbean or Middle Eastern origins have strongly influenced this genre.\n\nSince the 1990s Dutch electronic dance music (EDM) conquered the world in many forms, from trance, techno and gabber to hardstyle. Some of the world's best dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including Armin van Buuren, Tiësto, Hardwell, Oliver Heldens, Nicky Romero, Martin Garrix, Sander van Doorn and Afrojack; the first three of which have been ranked as best in the world by DJ Mag Top 100 DJs. The Amsterdam dance event (ADE) is the world's leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic subgenres on the planet.   These DJs also contribute to the world's mainstream pop music, as they frequently collaborate and produce for high profile international artists.\n\nIn classical music, Jan Sweelinck ranks as the Dutch most famous composer, with Louis Andriessen amongst the best known living Dutch classical composers. Ton Koopman is a Dutch conductor, organist and harpsichordist. He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. Notable violinists are Janine Jansen and André Rieu. The latter, together with his Johann Strauss Orchestra, has taken classical and waltz music on worldwide concert tours, the size and revenue of which are otherwise only seen from the world's biggest rock and pop music acts.   Acclaimed harpist Lavinia Meijer in 2012 released an album with works from Philip Glass that she transcribed for harp, with approval of Glass himself. The Concertgebouw (completed in 1888) in Amsterdam is home to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, considered one of the world's finest orchestras. \n\nFilm and television\n\nSome Dutch films – mainly by director Paul Verhoeven – have received international distribution and recognition, such as Turkish Delight (\"Turks Fruit\") (1973), Soldier of Orange (\"Soldaat van Oranje\") (1975), Spetters (1980) and The Fourth Man (\"De Vierde Man\") (1983). Verhoeven then went on to direct big Hollywood movies like RoboCop and Basic Instinct, and returned with Dutch film Black Book in 2006.\n\nOther well-known Dutch film directors are Jan de Bont (Speed), Anton Corbijn (A Most wanted Man), Dick Maas (De Lift), Fons Rademakers (The Assault), documentary maker Bert Haanstra and Joris Ivens. Film director Theo van Gogh achieved international notoriety in 2004 when he was murdered in the streets of Amsterdam after directing the short film Submission.\n\nInternationally successful Dutch actors include Famke Janssen (X-Men films), Carice van Houten (Game of Thrones), Michiel Huisman (Game of Thrones), Rutger Hauer (Blade Runner), Jeroen Krabbé (The Living Daylights) and Derek de Lint.\n\nThe Netherlands has a well developed television market, with both multiple commercial and non-commercial broadcasters. Imported TV programmes, as well as interviews with responses in a foreign language, are virtually always shown with the original sound, and subtitled. The only exception are shows for children.\n\nTV exports from the Netherlands mostly take the form of specific formats and franchises, most notably through internationally active TV production conglomerate Endemol, founded by Dutch media tycoons John de Mol and Joop van den Ende. Headquartered in Amsterdam, Endemol has around 90 companies in over 30 countries. Endemol and its subsidiaries create and run reality, talent, and game show franchises worldwide, including Big Brother and Deal or No Deal. John de Mol later started his own company Talpa which created show franchises like The Voice and Utopia.\n\nSports\n\nApproximately 4.5 million of the 16.8 million people in the Netherlands are registered to one of the 35,000 sports clubs in the country. About two-thirds of the population between 15 and 75 participates in sports weekly.  Football is the most popular participant sport in the Netherlands, before field hockey and volleyball as the second and third most popular team sports. Tennis, gymnastics and golf are the three most widely engaged in individual sports. \n\nOrganisation of sports began at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A Dutch National Olympic Committee was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the Summer Olympic Games and another 110 medals at the Winter Olympic Games.\n\nIn international competition Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The Netherlands women's field hockey team is the most successful team in World Cup history. The Netherlands baseball team have won the European championship 20 times out of 32 events. Dutch K-1 kickboxers have won the K-1 World Grand Prix 15 times out of 19 tournaments.\n\nThe Dutch speed skaters' performance at the 2014 Winter Olympics, where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history.\n\nMotorcycle racing at the TT Assen Circuit has a long history. Assen is the only venue to have held a round of the Motorcycle World Championship every year since its creation in 1949. The circuit was purpose built for the Dutch TT in 1954, with previous events having been held on public roads.\n\nLimburger Max Verstappen currently races in Formula One, and was the first Dutchman to win a Grand Prix. The coastal resort of Zandvoort hosted the Dutch Grand Prix from 1958 to 1985.\n\nCuisine\n\nOriginally, the country's cuisine was shaped by the practices of fishing and farming, including the cultivation of the soil for growing crops and raising domesticated animals. Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables.\n\nThe Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more cosmopolitan, with most global cuisines being represented in the major cities.\n\nThe Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Limburg and the Flemish Region in Belgium. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an haute cuisine.\n\nIn early 2014, Oxfam ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries. \n\nColonial heritage\n\nFrom the exploitations of the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century, to the colonisations in the 19th century, Dutch imperial possessions continued to expand, reaching their greatest extent by establishing a hegemony of the Dutch East Indies in the early 20th century. The Dutch East Indies, which later formed modern-day Indonesia, was one of the most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands.  Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands.\n\nIn the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, the Netherlands urbanised considerably, mostly financed by corporate revenue from the Asian trade monopolies. Social status was based on merchants' income, which reduced feudalism and considerably changed the dynamics of Dutch society. When the Dutch Royal Family was established in 1815, much of its wealth came from Colonial trade. \n\nUniversities such as the Royal Leiden University, founded in the 16th century, have developed into leading knowledge centres for Southeast Asian and Indonesian studies.  Leiden University has produced leading academics such as Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, and still has academics who specialise in Indonesian languages and cultures. Leiden University and in particular KITLV are educational and scientific institutions that to this day share both an intellectual and historical interest in Indonesian studies. Other scientific institutions in the Netherlands include the Amsterdam Tropenmuseum, an anthropological museum with massive collections of Indonesian art, culture, ethnography and anthropology.\n\nThe traditions of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL) are maintained by the Regiment Van Heutsz of the modern Royal Netherlands Army. A dedicated Bronbeek Museum, a former home for retired KNIL soldiers, exists in Arnhem to this day.\n\nA specific segment of Dutch literature called Dutch Indies literature still exists and includes established authors, such as Louis Couperus, the writer of \"The Hidden Force\", taking the colonial era as an important source of inspiration.  One of the great masterpieces of Dutch literature is the book \"Max Havelaar\", written by Multatuli in 1860. \n\nThe majority of Dutchmen that repatriated to the Netherlands after and during the Indonesian revolution are Indo (Eurasian), native to the islands of the Dutch East Indies. This relatively large Eurasian population had developed over a period of 400 years and were classified by colonial law as belonging to the European legal community.  In Dutch they are referred to as Indische Nederlanders or as Indo (short for Indo-European). \n\nIncluding their second generation descendants, Indos are currently the largest foreign-born group in the Netherlands. In 2008, the Dutch Census Bureau for Statistics (CBS)  registered 387,000 first- and second-generation Indos living in the Netherlands.  Although considered fully assimilated into Dutch society, as the main ethnic minority in the Netherlands, these 'repatriants' have played a pivotal role in introducing elements of Indonesian culture into Dutch mainstream culture.\n\nPractically every town in the Netherlands has a \"Toko\" (Dutch Indonesian Shop) or an Indonesian restaurant  and many 'Pasar Malam' (Night market in Malay/Indonesian) fairs are organised throughout the year. Many Indonesian dishes and foodstuffs have become commonplace in the Netherlands. Rijsttafel, a colonial culinary concept, and dishes such as Nasi goreng and satay are very popular in the Netherlands.",
                "Germany (; ,), officially the Federal Republic of Germany (, ),  is a sovereign state and federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. Its capital and largest city is Berlin. With about 81.8 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular human migration destination. \n\nVarious Germanic tribes have occupied the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During the Migration Period the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire.The Latin name Sacrum Imperium (Holy Empire) is documented as far back as 1157. The Latin name Sacrum Romanum Imperium (Holy Roman Empire) was first documented in 1254. The full name \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" (Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation) dates back to the 15th century. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nIn 1871 most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. The establishment of the national socialist dictatorship in 1933 led to World War II and systematic genocide. After a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In 1990, the country was reunified. \n\nIn the 21st century, Germany is a great power and has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, as well as the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer of goods. Germany is a developed country with a very high standard of living sustained by a skilled and productive society. It upholds a social security and universal health care system, environmental protection and a tuition-free university education. \n\nGermany was a founding member of the European Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G8, the G20, and the OECD. The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential artists, philosophers, musicians, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists and inventors.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.  The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land (\"the German lands\") is derived from deutsch (cf. dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc \"popular\" (i.e. belonging to the diot or diota \"people\"), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic *þiudiskaz \"popular\" (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived from *þeudō, descended from Proto-Indo-European *tewtéh₂- \"people\". \n\nHistory\n\nThe discovery of the Mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.  The oldest complete hunting weapons found anywhere in the world were discovered in a coal mine in Schöningen where three 380,000-year-old wooden javelins were unearthed.  The Neander Valley was the location where the first ever non-modern human fossil was discovered; the new species of human was called the Neanderthal. The Neanderthal 1 fossils are known to be 40,000 years old. Evidence of modern humans, similarly dated, has been found in caves in the Swabian Jura near Ulm. The finds include 42,000-year-old bird bone and mammoth ivory flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,  the 40,000-year-old Ice Age Lion Man which is the oldest uncontested figurative art ever discovered,  and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels which is the oldest uncontested human figurative art ever discovered.  The Nebra sky disk is a bronze artifact created during the European Bronze Age attributed to a site near Nebra, Saxony-Anhalt. It is part of  UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme. \n\nGermanic tribes and Frankish Empire\n\nThe Germanic tribes are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre-Roman Iron Age. From southern Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st century BC, coming into contact with the Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe.  Under Augustus, Rome began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains). In 9 AD, three Roman legions led by Varus were defeated by the Cheruscan leader Arminius. By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, Baden Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hessen and the western Rhineland, however, were Roman provinces. \n\nIn the 3rd century a number of large West Germanic tribes emerged: Alemanni, Franks, Chatti, Saxons, Frisii, Sicambri, and Thuringii. Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.  After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved further south-west. Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced or absorbed smaller Germanic tribes. Large areas known since the Merovingian period as Austrasia, Neustria,  and Aquitaine were conquered by the Franks who established the Frankish Kingdom, and pushed further east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria. Areas of what is today the eastern part of Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes of Sorbs, Veleti and the Obotritic confederation.\n\nEast Francia and Holy Roman Empire\n\nIn 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the Carolingian Empire, which was later divided in 843 among his heirs.  Following the break up of the Frankish Realm, for 900 years, the history of Germany was intertwined with the history of the Holy Roman Empire,  which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of Charlemagne's original empire. The territory initially known as East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe River in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.\n\nThe Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies and the German king Otto I was crowned Holy Roman Emperor of these regions in 962. In 996 Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the reign of the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture Controversy. \n\nIn the 12th century, under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by Slavs; they encouraged German settlement in these areas, called the eastern settlement movement (Ostsiedlung). Members of the Hanseatic League, which included mostly north German cities and towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.  In the south, the Greater Ravensburg Trade Corporation (Große Ravensburger Handelsgesellschaft) served a similar function. The edict of the Golden Bull issued in 1356 by Emperor Charles IV provided the basic constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics. \n\nPopulation declined in the first half of the 14th century, starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–50.  Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as Venice, Florence and Genoa. Artistic and cultural centers throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters Hans Holbein and his son, and Albrecht Dürer. Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses. \n\nIn 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses, challenging the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation. In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects, a principle called Cuius regio, eius religio. The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the Reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583. From the Cologne War until the end of the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands. The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 percent, and in some places, up to 80 percent.  The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the German states. German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648. \n\nIn the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of approximately 1,800 territories.  The elaborate legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1450–1555) created the Imperial Estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical, secular, and hereditary states, reflected in Imperial Diet. The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until  the death of Charles VI in 1740. Having no male heirs, he had convinced the Electors to retain Habsburg hegemony in the office of the emperor by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction. This was finally settled through the War of Austrian Succession; in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Maria Theresa's husband became Holy Roman Emperor, and she ruled the Empire as Empress Consort. From 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated the German states in the 18th century. As a consequence of the French Revolutionary Wars, and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the secular Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularized and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; German states, particularly the Rhineland states, fell under the influence of France. Until 1815, France, Russia, Prussia and the Habsburgs competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars. \n\nGerman Confederation and Empire\n\nFollowing the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna (convened in 1814) founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the Emperor of Austria as the permanent president of the Confederation reflected the Congress's failure to accept Prussia's influence among the German states, and acerbated the long-standing competition between the Hohenzollern and Habsburg interests. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Metternich. The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states.  National and liberal ideals of the French Revolution gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans. The Hambach Festival in May 1832 was a main event in support of German unity, freedom and democracy. In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe, which established a republic in France, intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.\n\nKing William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the new Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded war on Denmark in 1864, which promoted German over Danish interests in the Jutland peninsula. The subsequent (and decisive) Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation (Norddeutscher Bund) which excluded Austria from the federation's affairs. After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871 at Versailles, uniting all scattered parts of Germany except Austria. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the Hohenzollern King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital.\n\nIn the  period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as Chancellor of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating France by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under Wilhelm II, Germany, like other European powers, took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed. This resulted in creation of a dual alliance with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary, promoting at least benevolent neutrality if not outright military support. Subsequently, the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy, completing a Central European geographic alliance that illustrated German, Austrian and Italian fears of incursions against them by France and/or Russia. Similarly, Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France. \n\nAt the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South-West Africa, Togo, and Cameroon.  Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include German New Guinea, German Micronesia and German Samoa in the Pacific. In what became known as the \"First Genocide of the Twentieth-Century\", between 1904 and 1907, the German colonial government in South-West Africa (present-day Namibia) ordered the annihilation of the local Heroro and Namaqua peoples, as a punitive measure for an uprising against German colonial rule. In total, around 100,000 people—80% of the Herero and 50% of the Namaqua—perished form imprisonment in concentration camps, where the majority died of disease, abuse, and exhaustion, or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and water.  \n\nThe assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for the Austrian Empire to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,  a general armistice ended the fighting on 11 November, and German troops returned home. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes abdicated their positions and responsibilities. Germany's new political leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. In this treaty, Germany, as part of the Central Powers, accepted defeat by the Allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.    After the defeat in the First World War, Germany lost around thirteen percent of its European territory (areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic Polish, French and Danish populations, which were lost following the Greater Poland Uprising, the loss of Alsace-Lorraine and the Schleswig plebiscites), and all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the South Sea. \n\nWeimar Republic and Nazi Germany\n\nGermany was declared a republic at the beginning of the German Revolution in November 1918. On 11 August 1919 President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.  In the subsequent struggle for power, the radical-left Communists seized power in Bavaria, but conservative elements in other parts of Germany attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putsch. It was supported by parts of the Reichswehr (military) and other conservative, nationalistic and monarchist factions. After a tumultuous period of bloody street fighting in the major industrial centers, the occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops and the rise of inflation culminating in the hyperinflation of 1922–23, a debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of increasing artistic innovation and liberal cultural life. Underneath it all, though, lay a current of animosity and frustration over the Treaty of Versailles, widely perceived as a stab in the back, which provided the basis of much of the anti-Semetism rife in the next two decades.  The economic situation remained volatile. Historians describe the period between 1924 and 1929 as one of \"partial stabilization.\"  The world-wide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929. After the federal election of 1930, Chancellor Heinrich Brüning's government was enabled by President Paul von Hindenburg to act without parliamentary approval. Brüning's government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused high unemployment of nearly 30%  by 1932. \n\nThe Nazi Party won the special federal election of 1932. After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany in 1933.  After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights and within weeks the first Nazi concentration camp at Dachau opened.   The Enabling Act of 1933 gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power; subsequently, his government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations following a national referendum, and began military rearmament. \n\nUsing deficit spending, a government-sponsored program for economic renewal focused on public works projects. In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately were put to work, which gave them an income and social benefits.  The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns.  Other capital construction projects included such hydroelectric facilities as the Rur Dam, such water supplies as Zillierbach Dam, and such transportation hubs as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof.  Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose. \n\nIn 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities. Germany also reacquired control of the Saar in 1935,  annexed Austria in 1938, and occupied Czechoslovakia in early 1939.\n\nIn August 1939, Hitler's government signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact with Stalin that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. Following the agreement, on 1 September 1939  Germany invaded Poland, marking the beginning of World War II.   In response to Hitler's actions, Britain and France declared war on Germany.  In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France forcing the French government to sign an armistice after German troops occupied most of the country. The British repelled German air attacks in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and other Axis powers controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet Union's victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the allies' reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In June 1944, the Western allies landed in France and the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe. By late 1944, the Western allies had entered Germany despite one final German counter offensive in the Ardennes Forest. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, German armed forces surrendered on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. \n\nIn what later became known as The Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities and used a network of concentration and death camps across Europe to conduct a genocide of what they considered to be inferior races. In total, over 10 million civilians were systematically murdered, including 6 million Jews, between 220,000 and 1,500,000 Romani, 275,000 persons with disabilities, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of members of the political and religious opposition.  Nazi policies in the  German occupied countries resulted in the deaths of 2.7 million Poles,  1.3 million Ukrainians,  and an estimated 2.8 million Soviet war prisoners.  German military war casualties were estimated at between 3.2 million and 5.3 million soldiers,  and up to 2 million German civilians.  German territorial losses resulted in the expulsion of circa 12 million of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe. Germany ceded roughly one-quarter of its  pre-war territory. Strategic bombing and land warfare destroyed many cities and cultural heritage sites. After World War II, former members of the Nazi regime were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials. \n\nEast and West Germany\n\nAfter Germany surrendered, the Allies partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik). They were informally known as \"West Germany\" and \"East Germany\". East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo. \n\nWest Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the Marshall Plan and used this to rebuild its industry.  Konrad Adenauer was elected the first Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler) of Germany in 1949 and remained in office until 1963. Under his and Ludwig Erhard's leadership, the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s, that became known as an \"economic miracle\" (Wirtschaftswunder).  West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957.\n\nEast Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the USSR via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politbüro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service controlling many aspects of the society.  A Soviet-style command economy was set up and the GDR later became a Comecon state.\"Germany (East)\", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.  The Berlin Wall, built in 1961 to stop East Germans from escaping to West Germany, became a symbol of the Cold War. It was the site of Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachov, Tear down this wall!\" speech of 12 June 1987, which echoed John F. Kennedy's famous Ich bin ein Berliner speech of 26 June 1963. The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, German Reunification and Die Wende. \n\nTensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's . In summer 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open the borders, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. The East German authorities eased the border restrictions, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process. This culminated in the Two Plus Four Treaty a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the Instrument of Surrender, and Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.\n\nReunified Germany and EU\n\nThe united Germany is considered to be the enlarged continuation of the Federal Republic of Germany and not a successor state. As such, it retained all of West Germany's memberships in international organizations.  Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act, adopted in 1994, Berlin once again became the capital of the reunified Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.  The relocation of the government was completed in 1999.  Following the 1998 elections, SPD politician Gerhard Schröder became the first Chancellor of a red–green coalition with the Alliance '90/The Greens party.\n\nThe modernisation and integration of the eastern German economy is a long-term process scheduled to last until the year 2019, with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly $80 billion. \n\nSince reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union. Together with its European partners Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.  Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.  These deployments were controversial since Germany was bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles. \n\nIn the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female Chancellor of Germany as the leader of a grand coalition. In 2009 the German government approved a €50 billion economic stimulus plan to protect several sectors from a downturn. \n\nIn 2009, a liberal-conservative coalition under Merkel assumed leadership of the country. In 2013, a grand coalition was established in a Third Merkel cabinet. Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the \"Debt Brake\"  for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate significantly (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the future transition of the German economy, summarized as Industry 4.0. \n\nGermany was affected by the European migrant crisis in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for most migrants entering the EU. The country took in over a million refugees and developed a quota system which redistributed migrants around its federal states based on their tax income and existing population density. \n\nGeography\n\nGermany is in Western and Central Europe, with Denmark bordering to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria to the southeast, Switzerland to the south-southwest, France, Luxembourg and Belgium lie to the west, and the Netherlands to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes 47° and 55° N and longitudes 5° and 16° E. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. With Switzerland and Austria, Germany also shares a border on the fresh-water Lake Constance, the third largest lake in Central Europe.  German territory covers 357021 km2, consisting of 349223 km2 of land and 7798 km2 of water. It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the 62nd largest in the world. \n\nElevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2962 m) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: Wilstermarsch at  below sea level) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Germany's alpine glaciers are experiencing deglaciation. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, nickel, arable land and water.\n\nClimate\n\nMost of Germany has a temperate seasonal climate dominated by humid westerly winds. The country is situated in between the oceanic Western European and the continental Eastern European climate. The climate is moderated by the North Atlantic Drift, the northern extension of the Gulf Stream. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea; consequently in the northwest and the north the climate is oceanic. Germany gets an average of 789 mm of precipitation per year; there is no consistent dry season. Winters are mild and summers tend to be warm: temperatures can exceed 30 °C. \n\nThe east has a more continental climate: winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and longer dry periods can occur. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, with lower temperatures and more precipitation.\n\nBiodiversity\n\nThe territory of Germany can be subdivided into two ecoregions: European-Mediterranean montane mixed forests and Northeast-Atlantic shelf marine.   the majority of Germany is covered by either arable land (34%) or forest and woodland (30.1%); only 13.4% of the area consists of permanent pastures, 11.8% is covered by settlements and streets. \n\nPlants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one-third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.  The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol. \n\nThe 14 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park. In addition, there are 14 Biosphere Reserves, as well as 98 nature parks. More than 400 registered zoos and animal parks operate in Germany, which is believed to be the largest number in any country.  The Berlin Zoo, opened in 1844, is the oldest zoo in Germany, and presents the most comprehensive collection of species in the world. \n\nUrbanization\n\nGermany has a number of large cities. There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions in Germany. 34 cities have been identified as regiopolis. The largest conurbation is the Rhine-Ruhr region (11.7 million ), including Düsseldorf (the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia), Cologne, Bonn, Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg, and Bochum. \n\nPolitics\n\nGermany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity. \n\nThe president, Joachim Gauck (18 March 2012–present), is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates. The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspräsident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the head of government is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the Bundestag.\n\nThe chancellor, Angela Merkel (22 November 2005–present), is the head of government and exercises executive power, similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections, by proportional representation (mixed-member). The members of the Bundesrat represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.\n\nSince 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party (in parliament from 1949 to 2013) and the Alliance '90/The Greens (in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles. \n\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio of Germany had its peak in 2010 when it stood at 80.3% and decreased since then.  According to Eurostat, the government gross debt of Germany amounts to €2,152.0 billion or 71.9% of its GDP in 2015.  The federal government achieved a budget surplus of €12.1 billion ($13.1 billion) in 2015.  Germany's credit rating by credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings stands at the highest possible rating AAA with a stable outlook in 2016. \n\nLaw\n\nGermany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law. The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.  Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes, is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Finance Court and the Federal Administrative Court.\n\nCriminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.  Except for petty crimes, which are tried before a single professional judge, and serious political crimes, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges (') sit side by side with professional judges.   Many of the fundamental matters of administrative law remain in the jurisdiction of the states.\n\nConstituent states\n\nGermany comprises sixteen federal states which are collectively referred to as Bundesländer.  Each state has its own state constitution  and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation. Because of differences in size and population the subdivisions of these states vary, especially as between city states (Stadtstaaten) and states with larger territories (Flächenländer). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts (Regierungsbezirke).  Germany is divided into 402 districts (Kreise) at a municipal level; these consist of 295 rural districts and 107 urban districts. \n\nForeign relations\n\nGermany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad  and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.   it is the largest contributor to the budget of the European Union (providing 20%)  and the third largest contributor to the UN (providing 8%).  Germany is a member of NATO, the OECD, the G8, the G20, the World Bank and the IMF. It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighboring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.  \n\nThe development policy of Germany is an independent area of foreign policy. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.  It is the world's third biggest aid donor in 2009 after the United States and France.  \n\nIn 1999, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's government defined a new basis for German foreign policy by taking part in the NATO decisions surrounding the Kosovo War and by sending German troops into combat for the first time since 1945.  The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.  Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a  bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism. \n\nMilitary\n\nGermany's military, the Bundeswehr, is organised into Heer (Army and special forces KSK), Marine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force), Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service and Streitkräftebasis (Joint Support Service) branches. In absolute terms, German military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world.  In 2015, military spending was at €32.9 billion, about 1.2% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. \n\n the Bundeswehr employed roughly 178,000 service members, including 9,500 volunteers.  Reservists are available to the Armed Forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.  Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.  About 19,000 female soldiers are on active duty. According to SIPRI, Germany was the fourth largest exporter of major arms in the world in 2014. \n\nIn peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr. \n\nThe role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994 the term \"defense\" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. , the German military has about 2,370 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 850 Bundeswehr troops in the NATO-led ISAF force in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, 670 German soldiers in Kosovo, and 120 troops with UNIFIL in Lebanon. \n\nUntil 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, and conscripts served six-month tours of duty; conscientious objectors could instead opt for an equal length of Zivildienst (civilian service), or a six-year commitment to (voluntary) emergency services like a fire department or the Red Cross. In 2011 conscription was officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.   \n\nEconomy\n\nGermany has a social market economy with a highly skilled labour force, a large capital stock, a low level of corruption,  and a high level of innovation.  It is the world's third largest exporter of goods, and has the largest national economy in Europe which is also the world's fourth largest by nominal GDP[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2195.html Field listing – GDP (official exchange rate)] and the fifth one by PPP.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html Field listing – GDP (PPP exchange rate)]\n\nThe service sector contributes approximately 71% of the total GDP (including information technology), industry 28%, and agriculture 1%. The unemployment rate published by Eurostat amounts to 4.7% in January 2015, which  is the lowest rate of all 28 EU member states.  With 7.1% Germany also has the lowest youth unemployment rate of all EU member states. According to the OECD Germany has one of the highest labour productivity levels in the world. \n\nGermany is part of the European single market which represents more than 508 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Germany introduced the common European currency, the Euro in 2002.  It is a member of the Eurozone which represents around 338 million citizens. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is headquartered in Frankfurt, the financial centre of continental Europe.\n\nBeing home to the modern car, the automotive industry in Germany is regarded as one of the most competitive and innovative in the world,  and is the fourth largest by production.  The top 10 exports of Germany are vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical equipments, pharmaceuticals, transport equipments, basic metals, food products, and rubber and plastics. \n\nCompanies\n\nOf the world's 500 largest stock-market-listed companies measured by revenue in 2014, the Fortune Global 500, 28 are headquartered in Germany. 30 Germany-based companies are included in the DAX, the German stock market index. Well-known international brands include Mercedes-Benz, BMW, SAP, Volkswagen, Audi, Siemens, Allianz, Adidas, Porsche, and DHL. \n\nGermany is recognised for its large portion of specialised small and medium enterprises, known as the Mittelstand model. Around 1,000 of these companies are global market leaders in their segment and are labelled hidden champions.  Berlin developed a thriving, cosmopolitan hub for startup companies and became a leading location for venture capital funded firms in the European Union. \n\nThe list includes the largest German companies by revenue in 2014: \n\nTransport\n\n \n\nWith its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent.  Like its neighbours in Western Europe, Germany's road network is among the densest in the world.  The motorway (Autobahn) network ranks as the third-largest worldwide in length and is known for its lack of a general speed limit. \n\nGermany has established a polycentric network of high-speed trains. The InterCityExpress or ICE network of the Deutsche Bahn serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300 km/h (186 mph).  The German railways are subsidised by the government, receiving €17.0 billion in 2014. \n\nThe largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport, both hubs of Lufthansa, while Air Berlin has hubs at Berlin Tegel and Düsseldorf. Other major airports include Berlin Schönefeld, Hamburg, Cologne/Bonn and Leipzig/Halle.  The Port of Hamburg is one of the top twenty largest container ports in the world. \n\nEnergy and infrastructure\n\n, Germany was the world's sixth-largest consumer of energy,  and 60% of its primary energy was imported.  In 2014, energy sources were: oil (35.0%); coal, including lignite (24.6%); natural gas (20.5%); nuclear (8.1%); hydro-electric and renewable sources (11.1%).  The government and the nuclear power industry agreed to phase out all nuclear power plants by 2021.  It also enforces energy conservation, green technologies, emission reduction activities,  and aims to meet the country's electricity demands using 40% renewable sources by 2020. Germany is committed to the Kyoto protocol and several other treaties promoting biodiversity, low emission standards, water management, and the renewable energy commercialisation.  The country's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world — at around 65%.  Nevertheless, the country's greenhouse gas emissions were the highest in the EU .  The German energy transition (Energiewende) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy. \n\nScience and technology\n\nGermany's achievements in the sciences have been significant, and research and development efforts form an integral part of the economy.  The Nobel Prize has been awarded to 104 German laureates.  In the beginning of the 20th century, German laureates had more awards than those of any other nation, especially in the sciences (physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine).  \n\nNotable German physicists before the 20th century include Hermann von Helmholtz, Joseph von Fraunhofer and Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit, among others. Albert Einstein introduced the relativity theories for light and gravity in 1905 and 1915 respectively. Along with Max Planck, he was instrumental in the introduction of quantum mechanics, in which Werner Heisenberg and Max Born later made major contributions.  Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays.  Otto Hahn was a pioneer in the fields of radiochemistry and discovered nuclear fission, while Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch were founders of microbiology. Numerous mathematicians were born in Germany, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, David Hilbert, Bernhard Riemann, Gottfried Leibniz, Karl Weierstrass, Hermann Weyl and Felix Klein.\n\nGermany has been the home of many famous inventors and engineers, including Hans Geiger, the creator of the Geiger counter; and Konrad Zuse, who built the first fully automatic digital computer.  Such German inventors, engineers and industrialists as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin,  Otto Lilienthal, Gottlieb Daimler, Rudolf Diesel, Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology. German institutions like the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are the largest contributor to ESA. Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket at Peenemünde and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz's work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication. \n\nResearch institutions in Germany include the Max Planck Society, the Helmholtz Association and the Fraunhofer Society. The Wendelstein 7-X in Greifswald hosts a facility in the research of fusion power for instance.  The Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize is granted to ten scientists and academics every year. With a maximum of €2.5 million per award it is one of highest endowed research prizes in the world. \n\nTourism\n\nGermany is the seventh most visited country in the world,   with a total of 407 million overnights during 2012.  This number includes 68.83 million nights by foreign visitors. In 2012, over 30.4 million international tourists arrived in Germany. Berlin has become the third most visited city destination in Europe.  Additionally, more than 30% of Germans spend their holiday in their own country, with the biggest share going to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over EUR43.2 billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry contributes 4.5% of German GDP and supports 2 million jobs (4.8% of total employment). \n\nGermany is well known for its diverse tourist routes, such as the Romantic Road, the Wine Route, the Castle Road, and the Avenue Road. The German Timber-Frame Road (Deutsche Fachwerkstraße)  connects towns with examples of these structures.   There are 40 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Germany, including the old town cores of Regensburg, Bamberg, Lübeck, Quedlinburg, Weimar, Stralsund and Wismar. Germany's most-visited landmarks include i. e. Neuschwanstein Castle, Cologne Cathedral, Berlin Bundestag, Hofbräuhaus Munich, Heidelberg Castle, Dresden Zwinger, Fernsehturm Berlin and Aachen Cathedral. The Europa-Park near Freiburg is Europe's second most popular theme park resort. \n\nDemographics\n\nWith a population of 80.2 million according to the 2011 census,  rising to 81.5 million as at 30 June 2015  and to at least 81.9 million as at 31 December 2015,  Germany is the most populous country in the European Union, the second most populous country in Europe after Russia, and ranks as the 16th most populous country in the world.  Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (588 per square mile). The overall life expectancy in Germany at birth is 80.19 years (77.93 years for males and 82.58 years for females). The fertility rate of 1.41 children born per woman (2011 estimates), or 8.33 births per 1000 inhabitants, is one of the lowest in the world. Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate.  However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s,  particularly a rise in the number of well-educated migrants.  \n\nFour sizable groups of people are referred to as \"national minorities\" because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries.  There is a Danish minority (about 50,000) in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein. The Sorbs, a Slavic population of about 60,000, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. The Roma and Sinti live throughout the whole federal territory and the Frisians live on Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.\n\nApproximately 5 million Germans live abroad. \n\nImmigrant population\n\nIn 2014, about seven million of Germany's 81 million residents did not have German citizenship. Ninety-six percent of these people lived in western Germany and mostly in urban areas. \n \n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the German governments invited \"guest workers\" (Gastarbeiter) to migrate to Germany for work in the German industries. Many companies preferred to keep these workers employed in Germany after they had trained them and Germany's immigrant population has steadily increased. , about six million foreign citizens (7.7% of the population) were registered in Germany.\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office classifies the citizens by immigrant background. Regarding immigrant background, 20% of the country's residents, or more than 16 million people, were of immigrant or partially immigrant descent in 2009 (including persons descending or partially descending from ethnic German repatriates).  In 2010, 29% of families with children under 18 had at least one parent with immigrant roots. \n\nIn 2015, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.  Germany ranks 7th amongst EU countries and 37th globally in terms of the percentage of migrants who made up part of the country's population. , the largest national group was from Turkey (2,859,000), followed by Poland (1,617,000), Russia (1,188,000), and Italy (764,000).  Since 1987, around 3 million ethnic Germans, mostly from the former Eastern Bloc countries, have exercised their right of return and emigrated to Germany. \n\nReligion\n\nSince its foundation in 1871, Germany has been about two-thirds Protestant and one-third Roman Catholic, with a notable Jewish minority. Other faiths were also present, but to a much lesser degree. The religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through immigration and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through state policies. It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990. \n\nAccording to the 2011 German Census, Christianity is the largest religion in Germany, claiming 66.8% of the total population.  Relative to the whole population, 31.7% declared themselves as Protestants, including members of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) (30.8%) and the free churches  () (0.9%), and 31.2% declared themselves as Roman Catholics.  Orthodox believers constituted 1.3%, while Jews–0.1%. Other religions accounted for 2.7%. In 2014, the Catholic Church accounted for 23.9 million members (29.5% of the population)[http://www.dbk.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Zahlen%20und%20Fakten/Kirchliche%20Statistik/Bevoelkerung%20und%20Katholiken%20BL/2014-Tabelle-Bevoelkerung-Katholiken-Laender.pdf Official membership statistics of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany 2014/15], retrieved 20. June 2016 and the Evangelical Church for 22.6 million (27.9% of the population).[http://www.ekd.de/download/kirchenmitglieder_2014.pdf Official membership statistics of the Evangelical Church in Germany 2014], retrieved 05. June 2016 Both large churches have lost significant number of adherents in recent years.\n\nGeographically, Protestantism is concentrated in the northern, central and eastern parts of the country. These are mostly members of the EKD, which encompasses Lutheran, Reformed and unions of both traditions dating back to the Prussian Union of 1817. Roman Catholicism is concentrated in the south and west.\n\nIn 2011, 33% of Germans were not members of officially recognised religious associations with special status. Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany and major metropolitan areas.   \n\nIslam is the second largest religion in the country. In the 2011 census, 1.9% of Germans declared themselves to be Muslims.  More recent estimation suppose, there are between 2.1 and 4 million Muslims living in Germany.   Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. \n\nOther religions comprising less than one percent of Germany's population are Buddhism with 250,000 adherents (roughly 0.3%) and Hinduism with some 100,000 adherents (0.1%). All other religious communities in Germany have fewer than 50,000 adherents each. \n\nLanguages\n\nGerman is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany. It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union,  and one of the three working languages of the European Commission. German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers. \n\nRecognized native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Sorbian, Romany, and Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Kurdish, Polish, the Balkan languages, and Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.\n\nStandard German is a West Germanic language and is closely related to and classified alongside Low German, Dutch, Frisian and English languages. To a lesser extent, it is also related to the East Germanic (extinct) and  North Germanic languages. Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.  Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch). German is written using the Latin alphabet. German dialects, traditional local varieties traced back to the Germanic tribes, are distinguished from varieties of standard German by their lexicon, phonology, and syntax. \n\nEducation\n\nResponsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual federal states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.  Secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the Gymnasium enrols the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies; the Realschule for intermediate students lasts six years and the Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education.  The Gesamtschule unifies all secondary education.\n\nA system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school. This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world. \n\nMost of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.  The general requirement for university is the Abitur. However, there are a number of exceptions, depending on the state, the college and the subject. Tuition free academic education is open to international students and is increasingly common. \nAccording to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study. \n\nGermany has a long tradition of higher education reflecting the global status as a modern economy. The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386) being the oldest.  It is followed by the Leipzig University (1409), the Rostock University (1419) and the Greifswald University (1456).  The University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many European and Western universities. In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence: Humboldt University Berlin, the University of Bremen, the University of Cologne, TU Dresden, the University of Tübingen, RWTH Aachen, FU Berlin, Heidelberg University, the University of Konstanz, LMU Munich, and the Technical University of Munich.\n\nHealth\n\nGermany's system of hospices, called spitals, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s,  Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. Currently the population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization, Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded . In 2005, Germany spent 11% of its GDP on health care. Germany ranked 20th in the world in life expectancy with 77 years for men and 82 years for women, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births).\n\n, the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 41%, followed by malignant tumours, at 26%. \n, about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982).This article may incorporate text from this source, which is in the public domain.\nAccording to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers.  Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2007 study shows Germany has the highest number of overweight people in Europe.  \n\nCulture\n\nCulture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular. Historically Germany has been called Das Land der Dichter und Denker (\"the land of poets and thinkers\"),  because of the major role its writers and philosophers have played in the development of Western thought. \n\nGermany is well known for such folk festival traditions as Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.    UNESCO inscribed 40 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.  There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day). \n\nIn the 21st century Berlin has emerged as a major international creative center.  According to the Anholt–GfK Nation Brands Index, in 2014 Germany was the world's most respected nation among 50 countries (ahead of US, UK, and France).    A global opinion poll for the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.  \n\nMusic\n\nGerman classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude composed oratorios for organ, which influenced the later work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel; these men were influential composers of the Baroque period. During his tenure as violinist and teacher at the Salzburg cathedral, Augsburg-born composer Leopold Mozart mentored one of the most noted musicians of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber and Felix Mendelssohn were important in the early Romantic period. Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms composed in the Romantic idiom. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hans Zimmer are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries. \n\nGermany is the second largest music market in Europe, and fourth largest in the world.  German popular music of the 20th and 21st century includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie and schlager pop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.  DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Robin Schulz, Paul van Dyk, Paul Kalkbrenner, and Scooter). \n\nArt\n\nGerman painters have influenced western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Peter Paul Rubens and Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism.Marzona, Daniel. (2005) Conceptual Art. Cologne: Taschen. Various pages Such German sculptors as Otto Schmidt-Hofer, Franz Iffland, and Julius Schmidt-Felling made important contributions to German art history in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nSeveral German art groups formed in the 20th century, such as the November Group or Die Brücke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), by the Russian-born Wassily Kandinsky, influenced the development of Expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose as a counter-style to it during the Weimar Republic. Post-World War II art trends in Germany can broadly be divided into Neo-expressionism, performance art and Conceptualism. Especially notable neo-expressionists include Georg Baselitz, Anselm Kiefer, Jörg Immendorff, A. R. Penck, Markus Lüpertz, Peter Robert Keil and Rainer Fetting. Other notable artists who work with traditional media or figurative imagery include Martin Kippenberger, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Neo Rauch. Leading German conceptual artists include or included Bernd and Hilla Becher, Hanne Darboven, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Hans Haacke, Joseph Beuys, HA Schult, Aris Kalaizis, Neo Rauch (New Leipzig School) and Andreas Gursky (photography). Major art exhibitions and festivals in Germany are the documenta, the Berlin Biennale, transmediale and Art Cologne.\n\nArchitecture\n\nArchitectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance and Dresden Baroque). Among many renowned Baroque masters were Pöppelmann, Balthasar Neumann, Knobelsdorff and the Asam brothers. The Wessobrunner School exerted a decisive influence on, and at times even dominated, the art of stucco in southern Germany in the 18th century. The Upper Swabian Baroque Route offers a baroque-themed tourist route that highlights the contributions of such artists and craftsmen as the sculptor and plasterer Johann Michael Feuchtmayer, one of the foremost members of the Feuchtmayer family and the brothers Johann Baptist Zimmermann and Dominikus Zimmermann.  Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.Wilhelm Süvern: 1971. Torbögen und Inschriften lippischer Fachwerkhäuser in Volume 7 of Heimatland Lippe. Lippe Heimatbund: 1971. 48 pagesHeinrich Stiewe: 2007. Fachwerkhäuser in Deutschland: Konstruktion, Gestalt und Nutzung vom Mittelalter bis heute. Primus Verlag: 2007. ISBN 978-3-89678-589-3. 160 pages\n\nWhen industrialisation spread across Europe, Classicism and a distinctive style of historism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gründerzeit style, due to the economical boom years at the end of the 19th century. Regional historicist styles include the Hanover School, Nuremberg Style and Dresden's Semper-Nicolai School. Among the most famous of German buildings, the Schloss Neuschwanstein represents Romanesque Revival. Notable sub-styles that evolved since the 18th century are the  German spa and seaside resort architecture. German artists, writers and gallerists like Siegfried Bing, Georg Hirth and Bruno Möhring also contributed to the development of Art Nouveau at the turn of the 20th century, known as Jugendstil in German. \n\nExpressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles, with e.g. Fritz Höger, Erich Mendelsohn, Dominikus Böhm and Fritz Schumacher being influential architects. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius. Consequently, Germany is often considered the cradle of modern architecture and design. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.  Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Hans Kollhoff, Sergei Tchoban, KK Architekten, Helmut Jahn, Behnisch, GMP, Ole Scheeren, J. Mayer H., OM Ungers, Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto (the last two being Pritzker Prize winners). \n\nLiterature and philosophy\n\nGerman literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.  The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.History of the Deutsches Wörterbuch from the [http://150-grimm.bbaw.de/start.htm DWB 150th Anniversary Exhibition and Symposium], Berlin: Humboldt-Universität, 2004. , retrieved 27 June 2012.\n\nInfluential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass.  The German book market is the third largest in the world, after the United States and China.  The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years,  also the Leipzig Book Fair retains a major position in Europe. \n\nGerman philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; the development of the Frankfurt school by Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse and Jürgen Habermas have been particularly influential; and Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy, including his book The Decline of the West, in which he predicts the fall of the western European civilization and describes the Germanic culture as Faustian. \n\nMedia\n\nThe largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are the Bertelsmann enterprise, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. The German Press Agency DPA is also significant. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with some 38 million TV households.  Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels.  There are more than 500 public and private radio stations in Germany, with the public Deutsche Welle being the main German radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages.  Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio while ARD stations are covering local services.\n\nMany of Europe's best-selling newspapers and magazines are produced in Germany. The papers (and internet portals) with the highest circulation are Bild (a tabloid), Die Zeit, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt, the largest magazines include Der Spiegel, Stern and Focus. \n\nThe German video gaming market is one of the largest in the world.  The Gamescom in Cologne is the world's leading gaming convention.  Popular game series from Germany include Turrican, the Anno series, The Settlers series, the Gothic series, SpellForce, the FIFA Manager series, Far Cry and Crysis. Relevant game developers and publishers are Blue Byte, Crytek, Deep Silver, Kalypso Media, Piranha Bytes, Yager Development, and some of the largest social network game companies like Bigpoint, Gameforge, Goodgame and Wooga. \n\nCinema\n\nGerman cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Berlin's suburb Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Today it is Europe's largest studio.  Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film.  In 1930 Josef von Sternberg directed The Blue Angel, the first major German sound film, with Marlene Dietrich.  Films of Leni Riefenstahl set new artistic standards, in particular Triumph of the Will. \n\nAfter 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as  Trümmerfilm. Such films included Wolfgang Staudte's Die Mörder sind unter uns (The Murderers are among us) (1946). Notable East German films included Der Untertan (1951); Konrad Wolf's Der geteilte Himmel (Divided Heaven) (1964) and Frank Beyer's Jacob the Liar (1975). The defining film genre in West Germany of the 1950s was arguably the Heimatfilm (\"homeland film\"); these  films depicted the beauty of the land and the moral integrity of the people living in it. \n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim. German movies such as Das Boot (1981), The Never Ending Story (1984), Good Bye, Lenin! (2003), Head On (2004), The White Ribbon (2009), Animals United (2010), and Cloud Atlas (2012) also had international success. The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (\"Oscar\") went to the German production Die Blechtrommel (The Tin Drum) in 1979, to Nirgendwo in Afrika (Nowhere in Africa) in 2002, and to Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others) in 2007. \n\nThe annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as \"Berlinale\", awarding the \"Golden Bear\" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals.  The \"Lolas\" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards, that have been presented since 1951. \n\nCuisine\n\nGerman cuisine varies from region to region and often neighboring regions share some culinary similarities (e.g. the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia share some traditions with Switzerland and Austria). International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine and doner kebab are also popular and available, thanks to diverse ethnic communities.\n\nBread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 different types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen). German cheeses account for about a third of all cheese produced in Europe.[https://books.google.com/books?id\nsjW9adVFS2kC&pg=PA113 The Complete Idiot's Guide to Cheeses of the World - Steve Ehlers, Jeanette Hurt]. pp. 113-115. In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts, Weisswursts, and Currywursts.  In 2012, organic foods accounted for 3.9% of total food sales. \n\nAlthough wine is becoming more popular in many parts of Germany, especially in German wine regions,  the national alcoholic drink is beer. German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.  German beer purity regulations date back to the 15th century. \n\nThe 2015 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, the highest designation, while 38 more received two stars and 233 one star.  German restaurants have become the world's second-most decorated after France.  \n\nSports\n\nTwenty-seven million Germans are members of a sports club and an additional twelve million pursue sports individually.  Association football is the most popular sport. With more than 6.3 million official members, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) is the largest sports organisation of its kind worldwide, and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world. The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014, and the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996. Germany hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1974 and 2006 and the UEFA European Championship in 1988.\n\nOther popular spectator sports include winter sports, boxing, basketball, handball, volleyball, ice hockey, tennis, horse riding and golf. Water sports like sailing, rowing, and swimming are popular in Germany as well.\n\nGermany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 17 times, and Audi 13 times (). The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career, having won more Formula One World Drivers' Championships with seven titles, than any other. He is one of the highest paid sportsmen in history.  Sebastian Vettel is also among the top three most successful Formula One drivers of all time. \n\nHistorically, German athletes have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count (when combining East and West German medals). Germany was the last country to host both the summer and winter games in the same year, in 1936 the Berlin Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen,  and in Munich it hosted the Summer Games of 1972. \n\nFashion and design\n\nGerman designers were leaders of modern product design, with the Bauhaus designers like Mies van der Rohe, and Dieter Rams of Braun being essential. \n\nGermany is a leading country in the fashion industry. The German textile industry consisted of about 1,300 companies with more than 130,000 employees in 2010, which generated a revenue of 28 billion Euro. Almost 44 percent of the products are exported.  The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year. \n\nMunich, Hamburg and Düsseldorf are also important design, production and trade hubs of the domestic fashion industry, among smaller towns.  Renowned fashion designers from Germany include Karl Lagerfeld, Jil Sander, Wolfgang Joop, Philipp Plein and Michael Michalsky. Important brands include Hugo Boss, Escada, Adidas, Puma and Triumph. The German supermodels Claudia Schiffer, Heidi Klum, Tatjana Patitz and Nadja Auermann have come to international fame.",
                "Italy (), officially the Italian Republic (),     is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.The Italian peninsula is geographically located in Southern Europe, while North Italy can be placed partly or totally in Central Europe. Due to cultural, political and historical reasons, Italy is a Western European country. Italy covers an area of 301338 km2 and has a largely temperate seasonal climate or Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as lo Stivale (the Boot).   With 61 million inhabitants, it is the third most populous EU member state. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City.\n\nSince classical times, ancient Phoenicians and Greeks, Etruscans, and Celts have inhabited the south, centre and north of the Italian Peninsula respectively, with various Italic peoples dispersed throughout Italy alongside other ancient Italian tribes and Greek, Carthaginian, and Phoenician colonies. The Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom, which eventually spread throughout Italy, assimilating and conquering other nearby civilizations and forming the Roman Republic. Rome ultimately emerged as the dominant power, conquering much of the ancient world and becoming the leading cultural, political, and religious centre of Western civilisation.  The legacy of the Roman Empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law, republican governments, Christianity and the Latin script.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Italy suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous barbarian invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous rival city-states and maritime republics rose to great prosperity through shipping, commerce, and banking, and even laid the groundwork for capitalism.  These independent city-states and regional republics, acting as Europe's main port of entry for Asian and Near Eastern imported goods, often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy in comparison to the monarchies and feudal states found throughout Europe at the time, though much of central Italy remained under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern Italy remained largely feudal, partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Spanish, and Bourbon conquests of the region.\n\nThe Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration, and art with the start of the modern era. Italian culture flourished at this time, producing famous scholars, artists, and polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Michelangelo, and Machiavelli. Explorers from Italy such as Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and Giovanni da Verrazzano discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. Nevertheless, Italy's importance as a hub of commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes from the New World, as New World imports and trade routes became more influential in Europe and bypassed the East Asian and Mediterranean trade routes that the Italian city-states had dominated.  Furthermore, the Italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare, with this tension and violent rivalry culminating in the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, a series of wars and foreign invasions that left the Italian states vulnerable to annexation by neighboring European powers. Italy would remain politically fragmented and fall prey to conquest, occupation, and general foreign domination by European powers such as France, Spain, and Austria, subsequently entering a long period of decline.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, a rising movement in support of Italian nationalism and Italian independence from foreign control lead to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the Risorgimento, which sought to bring about a rebirth of Italian cultural and economic prominence by liberating and consolidating the Italian peninsula and insular Italy into an independent and unified nation-state. After various unsuccessful attempts, the Italian Wars of Independence, the Expedition of the Thousand and the capture of Rome resulted in the eventual unification of the country, now a great power after centuries of foreign domination and political division.  From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the new Kingdom of Italy rapidly industrialized, especially in the so-called Industrial Triangle of Milan, Turin and Genoa in the north, and soon acquired a small colonial empire.   However, the southern areas of the country remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialization, fueling a large and influential diaspora. Despite being one of the main victors in World War I, Italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading the way to the rise of a Fascist dictatorship in 1922. The subsequent participation in World War II on the Axis side ended in military defeat, economic destruction, and a civil war following the rise of the Italian resistance movement. In the years that followed, Italy abolished the Italian monarchy, reinstated democracy, enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, and, despite periods of sociopolitical turmoil (e.g. Anni di piombo, Mani pulite, Second Mafia War and Maxi Trial), became one of the world's most developed nations.   \n\nItaly has the third largest economy in the Eurozone and eighth largest economy in the world. It has a very high level of human development and enjoys the highest life expectancy in the EU.  Italy plays a prominent role in regional and global economic, military, cultural and diplomatic affairs, with a number of academics considering the country to be both a regional power  and a great power.   Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the member of numerous international institutions, including the UN, NATO, the OECD, the OSCE, the WTO, the G7/G8, G20, the Union for the Mediterranean, the Council of Europe, Uniting for Consensus, and  many more. As a reflection of its vast cultural wealth, Italy is home to 51 World Heritage Sites, the most in the world, and is one of the most visited countries. \n\nEtymology \n\nThe assumptions on the etymology of the name \"Italia\" are very numerous and the corpus of the solutions proposed by historians and linguists is very wide.Alberto Manco, Italia. Disegno storico-linguistico, 2009, Napoli, L'Orientale, ISBN 978-88-95044-62-0 According to one of the more common explanations, the term Italia, from ,OLD, p. 974: \"first syll. naturally short (cf. Quint.Inst.1.5.18), and so scanned in Lucil.825, but in dactylic verse lengthened metri gratia.\" was borrowed through Greek from the Oscan Víteliú, meaning \"land of young cattle\" (cf. Lat vitulus \"calf\", Umb vitlo \"calf\").  The bull was a symbol of the southern Italic tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the Social War. Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after Italus,  mentioned also by Aristotle  and Thucydides. \n\nThe name Italia originally applied only to a part of what is now Southern Italy – according to Antiochus of Syracuse, the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula (modern Calabria: province of Reggio, and part of the provinces of Catanzaro and Vibo Valentia). But by his time Oenotria and Italy had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of Lucania as well. The Greeks gradually came to apply the name \"Italia\" to a larger region, but it was during the reign of Emperor Augustus (end of the 1st century BC) that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the Alps. \n\nHistory \n\nPrehistory and antiquity \n\nExcavations throughout Italy revealed a Neanderthal presence dating back to the Paleolithic period, some 200,000 years ago,  modern Humans arrived about 40,000 years ago. The Ancient peoples of pre-Roman Italy – such as the Umbrians, the Latins (from which the Romans emerged), Volsci, Oscans, Samnites, Sabines, the Celts, the Ligures, and many others – were Indo-European peoples; the main historic peoples of possible non-Indo-European heritage include the Etruscans, the Elymians and Sicani in Sicily and the prehistoric Sardinians, which includes the Nuragic civilization. Other ancient Italian peoples of undetermined language families but of possible non-Indo-European origins include the Rhaetian people and Cammuni, known for their rock carvings.\n\nBetween the 17th and the 11th centuries BC Mycenaean Greeks established contacts with Italy     and in the 8th and 7th centuries BC Greek colonies were established all along the coast of Sicily and the southern part of the Italian Peninsula became known as Magna Graecia. Also the Phoenicians established colonies on the coasts of Sardinia and Sicily.\n\nRome, a settlement around a ford on the river Tiber conventionally founded in 753 BC, grew over the course of centuries into a massive empire, stretching from Britain to the borders of Persia, and engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin, in which Greek and Roman and many other cultures merged into a unique civilisation. The Roman legacy has deeply influenced the Western civilisation, shaping most of the modern world.  In a slow decline since the third century AD, the Empire split in two in 395 AD. The Western Empire, under the pressure of the barbarian invasions, eventually dissolved in 476 AD, when its last Emperor was deposed by the Germanic chief Odoacer, while the Eastern half of the Empire survived for another thousand years.\n\nMiddle Ages \n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy was seized by the Ostrogoths,   followed in the 6th century by a brief reconquest under Byzantine Emperor Justinian. The invasion of another Germanic tribe, the Lombards, late in the same century, reduced the Byzantine presence to a rump realm (the Exarchate of Ravenna) and started the end of political unity of the peninsula for the next 1,300 years. The Lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the Frankish Empire by Charlemagne in the late 8th century. The Franks also helped the formation of the Papal States in central Italy. Until the 13th century, Italian politics was dominated by the relations between the Holy Roman Emperors and the Papacy, with most of the Italian city-states siding for the former (Ghibellines) or for the latter (Guelphs) from momentary convenience. \n\nIt was during this chaotic era that Italian towns saw the rise of a peculiar institution, the medieval commune. Given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the Empire and the Holy See, local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order.   In 1176 a league of city-states, the Lombard League, defeated the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Battle of Legnano, thus ensuring effective independence for most of northern and central Italian cities. In coastal and southern areas, the maritime republics, the most notable being Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Amalfi, heavily involved in the Crusades, grew to eventually dominate the Mediterranean and monopolise trade routes to the Orient. \n\nIn the south, Sicily had become an Islamic emirate in the 9th century, thriving until the Italo-Normans conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the Lombard and Byzantine principalities of southern Italy.   Through a complex series of events, southern Italy developed as a unified kingdom, first under the House of Hohenstaufen, then under the Capetian House of Anjou and, from the 15th century, the House of Aragon. In Sardinia, the former Byzantine provinces became independent states known as Giudicati, although some parts of the island were under Genoese or Pisan control until the Aragonese conquered it in the 15th century. The Black Death pandemic of 1348 left its mark on Italy by killing perhaps one third of the population.   However, the recovery from the plague led to a resurgence of cities, trade and economy which allowed the bloom of Humanism and Renaissance, that later spread in Europe.\n\nEarly Modern \n\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, northern-central Italy was divided into a number of warring city-states, the rest of the peninsula being occupied by the larger Papal States and the Kingdom of Sicily, referred to here as Naples. Though many of these city-states were often formally subordinate to foreign rulers, as in the case of the Duchy of Milan, which was officially a constituent state of the mainly Germanic Holy Roman Empire, the city-states generally managed to maintain de facto independence from the foreign sovereigns that had seized Italian lands following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. The strongest among these city-states gradually absorbed the surrounding territories giving birth to the Signorie, regional states often led by merchant families which founded local dynasties. War between the city-states was endemic, and primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as condottieri, bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe, especially Germany and Switzerland, led largely by Italian captains.  Decades of fighting eventually saw Florence, Milan and Venice emerged as the dominant players that agreed to the Peace of Lodi in 1454, which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries. This peace would hold for the next forty years.\n\nThe Renaissance, a period of vigorous revival of the arts and culture, originated in Italy thanks to a number of factors, as the great wealth accumulated by merchant cities, the patronage of its dominant families like the Medici of Florence,   and the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy following the Conquest of Constantinople at the hands of the Ottoman Turks.Encyclopædia Britannica, Renaissance, 2008, O.Ed.Har, Michael H.

The ideas and ideals of the Renaissance soon spread into Northern Europe, France, England and much of Europe. In the meantime, the discovery of the Americas, the new routes to Asia discovered by the Portuguese and the rise of the Ottoman Empire, all factors which eroded the traditional Italian dominance in trade with the East, caused a long economic decline in the peninsula.\n\nFollowing the Italian Wars (1494 to 1559), ignited by the rivalry between France and Spain, the city-states gradually lost their independence and came under foreign domination, first under Spain (1559 to 1713) and then Austria (1713 to 1796). In 1629–1631, a new  outburst of plague claimed about 14% of Italy's population.  In addition, as the Spanish Empire started to decline in the 17th century, so did its possessions in Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and Milan. In particular, Southern Italy was impoverished and cut off from the mainstream of events in Europe.  In the 18th century, as a result of the War of Spanish Succession, Austria replaced Spain as the dominant foreign power, while the House of Savoy emerged as a regional power expanding to Piedmont and Sardinia. In the same century, the two-century long decline was interrupted by the economic and state reforms pursued in several states by the ruling élites.  During the Napoleonic Wars, northern-central Italy was invaded and reorganised as a new Kingdom of Italy, a client state of the French Empire,  while the southern half of the peninsula was administered by Joachim Murat, Napoleon's brother-in-law, who was crowned as King of Naples. The 1814 Congress of Vienna restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the French Revolution could not be eradicated, and soon re-surfaced during the political upheavals that characterised the first part of the 19th century.\n\nItalian unification \n\nThe birth of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula. In the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful war was declared on Austria. The Kingdom of Sardinia again attacked the Austrian Empire in the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859, with the aid of France, resulting in liberating Lombardy.\n\nIn 1860–61, general Giuseppe Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily,  allowing the Sardinian government led by the Count of Cavour to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861. In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War, waging the Third Italian War of Independence which allowed Italy to annex Venetia. Finally, as France during the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870 abandoned its garrisons in Rome, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the Papal States.\n\nThe Piedmontese Albertine Statute of 1848, extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, provided for basic freedoms, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. As Northern Italy quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad, while the Italian Socialist Party constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. Starting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing Somalia, Eritrea and later Libya and the Dodecanese under its rule. \n\nItaly, nominally allied with the German Empire and the Empire of Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance, in 1915 joined the Allies into the war with a promise of substantial territorial gains, that included western Inner Carniola, former Austrian Littoral, Dalmatia as well as parts of the Ottoman Empire. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army get struck in a long attrition war in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of Vittorio Veneto. The Italian victory    marked the end of the war on the Italian Front, secured the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was chiefly instrumental in ending the First World War less than two weeks later.\n\nDuring the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers and as many civilians died  and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy. Under the Peace Treaties of Saint-Germain, Rapallo and Rome, Italy obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except Zara), allowing nationalists to define the victory as \"mutilated\". Moreover, Italy annexed the Hungarian harbour of Fiume, that was not part of territories promised at London but had been occupied after the end of the war by Gabriele D'Annunzio.\n\nFascist Regime \n\nThe socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the Russian Revolution, led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small National Fascist Party, led by Benito Mussolini. In October 1922 the Blackshirts of the National Fascist Party attempted a coup (the \"March on Rome\") which failed but at the last minute, King Victor Emmanuel III refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a dictatorship. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as Nazi Germany and Francoist Spain.\n\nIn 1935, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia, resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations; Italy allied with Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan and strongly supported Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war. In 1939, Italy annexed Albania, a de facto protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in British Somaliland and Egypt, the Italians were defeated in East Africa, Greece, Russia and North Africa.\n\nAfter the attack on Yugoslavia by Germany and Italy, suppression of the Yugoslav Partisans resistance and attempts to Italianization resulted in the Italian war crimes  and deportation of about 25,000 people to the Italian concentration camps, such as Rab, Gonars, Monigo, Renicci di Anghiari and elsewhere. After the war, due to the Cold war, a long period of censorship, disinterest and denial occurred about the Italian war crimes and the Yugoslav's foibe killings.     Meanwhile, about 250,000 Italians and anti-communist Slavs fled to Italy in the Istrian exodus.\n\nAn Allied invasion of Sicily began in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini on 25 July. On 8 September, Italy surrendered. The Germans shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a battlefield for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.\n\nIn the north, the Germans set up the Italian Social Republic (RSI), a Nazi puppet state with Mussolini installed as leader. The post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the Resistenza. Hostilities ended on 29 April 1945, when the German forces in Italy surrendered. Nearly half a million Italians (including civilians) died in the conflict,  and the Italian economy had been all but destroyed; per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century. \n\nRepublican Italy \n\nItaly became a republic after a referendum  held on 2 June 1946, a day celebrated since as Republic Day. This was also the first time that Italian women were entitled to vote.  Victor Emmanuel III's son, Umberto II, was forced to abdicate and exiled. The Republican Constitution was approved on 1 January 1948. Under the Treaty of Peace with Italy of 1947, most of Julian March was lost to Yugoslavia and, later, the Free Territory of Trieste was divided between the two states. Italy also lost all its colonial possessions, formally ending the Italian Empire.\n\nFears in the Italian electorate of a possible Communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on 18 April 1948, when the Christian Democrats, under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi, obtained a landslide victory. Consequently, in 1949 Italy became a member of NATO. The Marshall Plan helped to revive the Italian economy which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the \"Economic Miracle\". In 1957, Italy was a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC), which became the European Union (EU) in 1993.\n\nFrom the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the Years of Lead, a period characterised by economic crisis (especially after the 1973 oil crisis), widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups, with the alleged involvement of US and Soviet intelligence. /  /  /   The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro in 1978 and the Bologna railway station massacre in 1980, where 85 people died.\n\nIn the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: one liberal (Giovanni Spadolini) and one socialist (Bettino Craxi); the Christian Democrats remained, however, the main government party. During Craxi's government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth largest industrial nation, gaining entry into the G7 Group. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the GDP.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Italy faced significant challenges, as voters – disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and the extensive corruption system (known as Tangentopoli) uncovered by the 'Clean Hands' investigation – demanded radical reforms. The scandals involved all major parties, but especially those in the government coalition: the Christian Democrats, who ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded, splitting up into several factions.  The Communists reorganised as a social-democratic force. During the 1990s and the 2000s (decade), center-right (dominated by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi) and center-left coalitions (led by university professor Romano Prodi) alternatively governed the country.\n\nIn the late 2000s, Italy was severely hit by the Great Recession. From 2008 to 2015, the country suffered 42 months of GDP recession. The economic crisis was one of the main problems that forced Berlusconi to resign in 2011. The government of the conservative Prime Minister was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of Mario Monti. Following the 2013 general election, the Vice-Secretary of the Democratic Party Enrico Letta formed a new government at the head of a right-left Grand coalition. In 2014, challenged by the new Secretary of the PD Matteo Renzi, Letta resigned and was replaced by Renzi. The new government started important constitutional reforms such as the abolition of the Senate and a new electoral law.\n\nGeography \n\nItaly is located in Southern Europe, between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E. To the north, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia, in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy, while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.\n\nThe country's total area is 301230 km², of which 294020 km² is land and 7210 km² is water. Including the islands, Italy has a coastline and border of 7600 km on the Adriatic, Ionian, Tyrrhenian seas (740 km), and borders shared with France (488 km), Austria (430 km), Slovenia (232 km) and Switzerland (740 km). San Marino (39 km) and Vatican City (), both enclaves, account for the remainder.\n\nThe Apennine Mountains form the peninsula's backbone and the Alps form most of its northern boundary, where Italy's highest point is located on Monte Bianco (4,810 m/15,782 ft).Official French maps show the border detouring south of the main summit, and claim the highest point in Italy is Mont Blanc de Courmayeur (4,748 m), but these are inconsistent with an 1861 convention and topographic watershed analysis. The Po, Italy's longest river (652 km/405 mi), flows from the Alps on the western border with France and crosses the Padan plain on its way to the Adriatic Sea.\nThe five largest lakes are, in order of diminishing size:  Garda (), Maggiore (, shared with Switzerland), Como (), Trasimeno () and Bolsena ().\n\nThe country is situated at the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate, leading to considerable seismic and volcanic activity. There are 14 volcanoes in Italy, four of which are active: Etna (the traditional site of Vulcan’s smithy), Stromboli, Vulcano and Vesuvius. Vesuvius is the only active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of Pompeii and Herculanum. Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity, and there is still a large active caldera, the Campi Flegrei north-west of Naples.\n\nAlthough the country comprises the Italian peninsula and most of the southern Alpine basin, some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the Eurasian continental shelf. These territories are the comuni of: Livigno, Sexten, Innichen, Toblach (in part), Chiusaforte, Tarvisio, Graun im Vinschgau (in part), which are all part of the Danube's drainage basin, while the Val di Lei constitutes part of the Rhine's basin and the islands of Lampedusa and Lampione are on the African continental shelf.\n\nEnvironment \n\nAfter its quick industrial growth, Italy took a long time to confront its environmental problems. After several improvements, it now ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability.  National parks cover about five percent of the country.  In the last decade, Italy has become one of the world's leading producers of renewable energy, ranking as the world’s fourth largest holder of installed solar energy capacity   and the sixth largest holder of wind power capacity in 2010.  Renewable energies now make up about 12% of the total primary and final energy consumption in Italy, with a future target share set at 17% for the year 2020. \n\nHowever, air pollution remains a severe problem, especially in the industrialised north, reaching the tenth highest level worldwide of industrial carbon dioxide emissions in the 1990s.  Italy is the twelfth largest carbon dioxide producer.  \nExtensive traffic and congestion in the largest metropolitan areas continue to cause severe environmental and health issues, even if smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s, and the presence of smog is becoming an increasingly rarer phenomenon and levels of sulphur dioxide are decreasing. \n\nMany watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity, while because of rising water levels, Venice has been regularly flooded throughout recent years. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas, as in the case of the Seveso disaster. The country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but, after the Chernobyl disaster and a referendum on the issue the nuclear program was terminated, a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008, planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with French technology. This was in turn struck down by a referendum following the Fukushima nuclear accident. \n\nDeforestation, illegal building developments and poor land-management policies have led to significant erosion all over Italy's mountainous regions, leading to major ecological disasters like the 1963 Vajont Dam flood, the 1998 Sarno  and 2009 Messina mudslides.\n\nClimate \n\nThanks to the great longitudinal extension of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous internal conformation, the climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic. In particular, the climate of the Po valley geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.  \n\nThe coastal areas of Liguria, Tuscany and most of the South generally fit the Mediterranean climate stereotype (Köppen climate classification Csa). Conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interior's higher ground and valleys, particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from 0 C on the Alps to\n12 C in Sicily, like so the average summer temperatures range from 20 C to over 30 C. \n\nPolitics \n\nItaly has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by a constitutional referendum. The President of Italy (Presidente della Repubblica), currently Sergio Mattarella since 2015, is Italy's head of state. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the Parliament of Italy in joint session. Italy has a written democratic constitution, resulting from the work of a Constituent Assembly formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the Civil War. \n\nGovernment \n\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a proportional voting system. The parliament is perfectly bicameral: the two houses, the Chamber of Deputies (that meets in Palazzo Montecitorio) and the Senate of the Republic (that meets in Palazzo Madama), have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially President of the Council of Ministers (Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri), is Italy's head of government. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic, but must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. The incumbent Prime Minister is Matteo Renzi of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe prime minister is the President of the Council of Ministers—which holds effective executive power— and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorized to request the dissolution of the Parliament of Italy.\n\nAnother difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: Coordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; Apply and protect State secrets; Authorize agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law. \n\nA peculiarity of the Italian Parliament is the representation given to Italian citizens permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct overseas constituencies. In addition, the Italian Senate is characterised also by a small number of senators for life, appointed by the President \"for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field\". Former Presidents of the Republic are ex officio life senators.\n\nItaly's three major political parties are the Democratic Party, Forza Italia and the Five Stars Movement. During the 2013 general election these three parties won 579 out of 630 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies and 294 out of 315 in the Senate.  Most of the remaining seats were won by a short-lived electoral bloc formed to support the outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti, the far left party Left, Ecology, Freedom or by parties that contest elections only in one part of Italy: the Northern League, the South Tyrolean People's Party, Vallée d'Aoste and Great South. On 15 November 2013, 58 splinter MPs from Forza Italia founded New Centre-Right.\n\nLaw and criminal justice \n\nThe Italian judicial system is based on Roman law modified by the Napoleonic code and later statutes. The Supreme Court of Cassation is the highest court in Italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases. The Constitutional Court of Italy (Corte Costituzionale) rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and is a post–World War II innovation. Since their appearance in the middle of the 19th century, Italian organised crime and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in Southern Italy, the most notorious of which being the Sicilian Mafia, which would later expand into some foreign countries including the United States. The Mafia receipts may reach 9%   of Italy's GDP. \n\nA 2009 report identified 610 comuni which have a strong Mafia presence, where 13 million Italians live and 14.6% of the Italian GDP is produced.   The Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, nowadays probably the most powerful crime syndicate of Italy, accounts alone for 3% of the country's GDP.  However, at 0.013 per 1,000 people, Italy has only the 47th highest murder rate  (in a group of 62 countries) and the 43rd highest number of rapes per 1,000 people in the world (in a group of 65 countries), relatively low figures among developed countries.\n\nLaw enforcement \n\nLaw enforcement in Italy is provided by multiple police forces, five of which are national, Italian agencies.\nThe Polizia di Stato (State Police) is the civil national police of Italy. Along with patrolling, investigative and law enforcement duties, it patrols the Autostrada (Italy's Express Highway network), and oversees the security of railways, bridges and waterways.\nThe Carabinieri is the common name for the Arma dei Carabinieri, a Gendarmerie-like military corps with police duties. They also serve as the military police for the Italian armed forces.\nThe Guardia di Finanza, (English: Financial Guard) is a corps under the authority of the Minister of Economy and Finance, with a role as police force. The Corps is in charge of financial, economic, judiciary and public safety.\nThe Corpo Forestale dello Stato (National Forestry Department) is responsible for law enforcement in Italian national parks and forests. Their duties include enforcing poaching laws, safeguarding protected animal species and preventing forest fires.\n\nForeign relations \n\nItaly is a founding member of the European Community, now the European Union (EU), and of NATO. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and it is a member and strong supporter of a wide number of international organisations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, and the Central European Initiative. Its recent turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), the forerunner of the OSCE, in 1994; G8; and the EU in 2009 and from July to December 2003.\n\nItaly strongly supports multilateral international politics, endorsing the United Nations and its international security activities. , Italy was deploying 5,296 troops abroad, engaged in 33 UN and NATO missions in 25 countries of the world.  Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Mozambique, and East Timor and provides support for NATO and UN operations in Bosnia, Kosovo and Albania. Italy deployed over 2,000 troops in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) from February 2003. Italy still supports international efforts to reconstruct and stabilise Iraq, but it had withdrawn its military contingent of some 3,200 troops by November 2006, maintaining only humanitarian operators and other civilian personnel.\nIn August 2006 Italy deployed about 2,450 troops in Lebanon for the United Nations' peacekeeping mission UNIFIL.  Italy is one of the largest financiers of the Palestinian National Authority, contributing €60 million in 2013 alone. \n\nMilitary \n\nThe Italian Army, Navy, Air Force and Carabinieri collectively form the Italian Armed Forces, under the command of the Supreme Defence Council, presided over by the President of Italy. From 2005, military service is entirely voluntary.  In 2010, the Italian military had 293,202 personnel on active duty,  of which 114,778 are Carabinieri.  Total Italian military spending in 2010 ranked tenth in the world, standing at $35.8 billion, equal to 1.7% of national GDP. As part of NATO's nuclear sharing strategy Italy also hosts 90 United States nuclear bombs, located in the Ghedi and Aviano air bases. \n\nThe Italian Army is the national ground defence force, numbering 109,703 in 2008. Its best-known combat vehicles are the Dardo infantry fighting vehicle, the Centauro tank destroyer and the Ariete tank, and among its aircraft the Mangusta attack helicopter, recently deployed in UN missions. It also has at its disposal a large number of Leopard 1 and M113 armoured vehicles.\n\nThe Italian Navy in 2008 had 35,200 active personnel with 85 commissioned ships and 123 aircraft.  It is now equipping itself with a bigger aircraft carrier (the Cavour), new destroyers, submarines and multipurpose frigates. In modern times the Italian Navy, being a member of the NATO, has taken part in many coalition peacekeeping operations around the world.\n\nThe Italian Air Force in 2008 had a strength of 43,882 and operated 585 aircraft, including 219 combat jets and 114 helicopters. As a stopgap and as replacement for leased Tornado ADV interceptors, the AMI has leased 30 F-16A Block 15 ADF and four F-16B Block 10 Fighting Falcons, with an option for more. The coming years will also see the introduction of 121 EF2000 Eurofighter Typhoons, replacing the leased F-16 Fighting Falcons. Further updates are foreseen in the Tornado IDS/IDT and AMX fleets. A transport capability is guaranteed by a fleet of 22 C-130Js and Aeritalia G.222s of which 12 are being replaced with the newly developed G.222 variant called the C-27J Spartan.\n\nAn autonomous corps of the military, the Carabinieri are the gendarmerie and military police of Italy, policing the military and civilian population alongside Italy's other police forces. While the different branches of the Carabinieri report to separate ministries for each of their individual functions, the corps reports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs when maintaining public order and security. \n\nAdministrative divisions \n\nItaly is subdivided into 20 regions (regioni), five of these regions having a special autonomous status that enables them to enact legislation on some of their local matters. The country is further divided into 14 metropolitan cities (città metropolitane) and 96 provinces (province), which in turn are subdivided in 8,047 municipalities (comuni). \n\nEconomy \n\nItaly has a capitalist mixed economy, ranking as the third-largest in the Eurozone and the eighth-largest in the world.  The country is a founding member of the G7, G8, the Eurozone and the OECD.\n\nItaly is regarded as one of the world's most industrialised nations and a leading country in world trade and exports.    It is a highly developed country, with the world's 8th highest quality of life and the 25th Human Development Index. The country is well known for its creative and innovative business,  a large and competitive agricultural sector  (Italy is the world's largest wine producer),  and for its influential and high-quality automobile, machinery, food, design and fashion industry.   \n\nItaly is the world's sixth largest manufacturing country,  characterised by a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size and a large number of dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises, notoriously clustered in several industrial districts, which are the backbone of the Italian industry. This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products, that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity, on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from China and other emerging Asian economies based on lower labour costs, with higher quality products. \n\nThe country was the world's 7th largest exporter in 2009.  Italy's closest trade ties are with the other countries of the European Union, with whom it conducts about 59% of its total trade. Its largest EU trade partners, in order of market share, are Germany (12.9%), France (11.4%), and Spain (7.4%).  Finally, tourism is one of the fastest growing and profitable sectors of the national economy: with 48.6 million international tourist arrivals and total receipts estimated at $45.5 billion in 2014, Italy was the fifth most visited country and the sixth highest tourism earner in the world. \n\nItaly  is part of the European single market which represents more than 500 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Italy introduced the common European currency, the Euro in 2002.  It is a member of the Eurozone which represents around 330 million citizens. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank.\n\nItaly has been hit very hard by the Great Recession and the subsequent European sovereign-debt crisis, that exacerbated the country's structural problems.  Effectively, after a strong GDP growth of 5–6% per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s,  and a progressive slowdown in the 1980-90s, the country virtually stagnated in the 2000s.   The political efforts to revive growth with massive government spending eventually produced a severe rise in public debt, that stood at over 135% of GDP in 2014, ranking second in the EU only after the Greek one (at 174%).  For all that, the largest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by national subjects, a major difference between Italy and Greece,  and the level of household debt is much lower than the OECD average. \n\nA gaping North–South divide is a major factor of socio-economic weakness.  It can be noted by the huge difference in statistical income between the northern and southern regions and municipalities.  The richest region, Lombardy, earns 127% of the national GDP per capita, while the poorest, Calabria, only 61%  The unemployment rate (11.9%) stands slightly above the Eurozone average,  however the average figure is 7.9% in the North and 20.2% in the South. \n\nInfrastructure \n\n In 2004 the transport sector in Italy generated a turnover of about 119.4 billion euros, employing 935,700 persons in 153,700 enterprises. Regarding the national road network, in 2002 there were 668721 km of serviceable roads in Italy, including 6487 km of motorways, state-owned but privately operated by Atlantia. In 2005, about 34,667,000 passenger cars (590 cars per 1,000 people) and 4,015,000 goods vehicles circulated on the national road network. \n\nThe national railway network, state-owned and operated by Ferrovie dello Stato, in 2008 totalled  of which  is electrified, and on which 4,802 locomotives and railcars run.\n\nThe national inland waterways network comprised 1477 km of navigable rivers and channels in 2002. In 2004 there were approximately 30 main airports (including the two hubs of Malpensa International in Milan and Leonardo da Vinci International in Rome) and 43 major seaports (including the seaport of Genoa, the country's largest and second largest in the Mediterranean Sea). In 2005 Italy maintained a civilian air fleet of about 389,000 units and a merchant fleet of 581 ships.\n\nItaly needs to import about 80% of its energy requirements.   \n\nItaly does not invest enough to maintain its drinking water supply and sanitation infrastructure, while water and sanitation tariffs are among the lowest in the European Union. The Galli Law, passed in 1993, aimed at raising the level of investment and to improve service quality by consolidating service providers, making them more efficient and increasing the level of cost recovery through tariff revenues. Despite these reforms, investment levels have declined and remain far from sufficient.   \n\nScience and technology \n\nThrough the centuries, Italy has fostered the scientific community that produced many major discoveries in physics and the other sciences. During the Renaissance Italian polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), Michelangelo (1475–1564) and Leon Battista Alberti (1404–72) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include key improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of Copernicanism over the Ptolemaic model. \nOther astronomers suchs as Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625–1712) and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835–1910) made many important discoveries about the Solar System. In mathematics, Joseph Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736–1813) was active before leaving Italy. Fibonacci (c. 1170 – c. 1250), and Gerolamo Cardano (1501–76) made fundamental advances in mathematics. Luca Pacioli established accounting to the world. Physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–54), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the first nuclear reactor and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the quantum theory and was one of the key figures in the creation of the nuclear weapon. He, Emilio G. Segrè, and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by Fascist laws against Jews, including Emilio G. Segrè (1905–89) (who discovered the elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton),  and Bruno Rossi (1905–93), a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy.\n\nOther prominent physicists include: Amedeo Avogadro (most noted for his contributions to molecular theory, in particular the Avogadro's law and the Avogadro constant), Evangelista Torricelli (inventor of barometer), Alessandro Volta (inventor of electric battery), Guglielmo Marconi (inventor of radio), Ettore Majorana (who discovered the Majorana fermions), Carlo Rubbia (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the W and Z particles at CERN). In biology, Francesco Redi has been the first to challenge the theory of spontaneous generation by demonstrating that maggots come from eggs of flies and he described 180 parasites in details and Marcello Malpighi founded microscopic anatomy, Lazzaro Spallanzani conducted important research in bodily functions, animal reproduction, and cellular theory, Camillo Golgi, whose many achievements include the discovery of the Golgi complex, paved the way to the acceptance of the Neuron doctrine, Rita Levi-Montalcini discovered the nerve growth factor (awarded 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine). In chemistry, Giulio Natta received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 for his work on high polymers. Giuseppe Occhialini received the Wolf Prize in Physics for the discovery of the pion or pi-meson decay in 1947. Ennio de Giorgi, a Wolf Prize in Mathematics recipient in 1990, solved Bernstein's problem about minimal surfaces and the 19th Hilbert problem on the regularity of solutions of Elliptic partial differential equations.\n\nDemographics \n\nAt the end of 2013, Italy had 60,782,668 inhabitants.  The resulting population density, at 202 PD/km2, is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia are very sparsely populated.\n\nThe population of Italy almost doubled during the 20th century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven because of large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the Italian economic miracle of the 1950–1960s. High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they start to dramatically decline, leading to rapid population ageing. At the end of the 2000s (decade), one in five Italians was over 65 years old.  However, in recent years Italy experienced a significant growth in birth rates.  The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008. \nThe TFR is expected to reach 1.6–1.8 in 2030. \n\nFrom the late 19th century until the 1960s Italy was a country of mass emigration. Between 1898 and 1914, the peak years of Italian diaspora, approximately 750,000 Italians emigrated each year.  The diaspora concerned more than 25 million Italians and it is considered the biggest mass migration of contemporary times.  As a result, today more than 4.1 million Italian citizens are living abroad,[http://www.interno.it/mininterno/export/sites/default/it/sezioni/servizi/legislazione/elezioni/0947_2010_02_01_DM27012010.html Statistiche del Ministero dell'Interno] while at least 60 million people of full or part Italian ancestry live outside of Italy, most notably in Argentina,  Brazil,  Uruguay,  Venezuela,  the United States,  Canada,  Australia,  and France. \n\nMetropolitan cities \n\nEthnic groups \n\nIn 2014, Italy had about 4.9 million foreign residents,  making up some 8.1% of the total population. The figures include more than half a million children born in Italy to foreign nationals—second generation immigrants, but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired Italian nationality; this applies to about 130,000 people a year.  The official figures also exclude illegal immigrants, that were estimated in 2008 to number at least 670,000. \n\nStarting from the early 1980s, until then a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society, Italy begun to attract substantial flows of foreign immigrants.  After the fall of the Berlin Wall and, more recently, the 2004 and 2007 enlargements of the European Union, large waves of migration originated from the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe (especially Romania, Albania, Ukraine and Poland). An equally important source of immigration is neighbouring North Africa (in particular, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia), with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the Arab Spring. Furthermore, in recent years, growing migration fluxes from Asia-Pacific (notably China  and the Philippines) and Latin America (mainly from Peru and Ecuador) have been recorded.\n\nCurrently, about one million Romanian citizens (around one tenth of them being Roma ) are officially registered as living in Italy, representing thus the most important individual country of origin, followed by Albanians and Moroccans with about 500,000 people each. The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate, but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more.  Overall, at the end of the 2000s (decade) the foreign born population of Italy was from: Europe (54%), Africa (22%), Asia (16%), the Americas (8%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 87% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 13% live in the southern half of the peninsula.\n\nLanguages \n\nItaly's official language is Italian.  It is estimated that there are about 64 million native Italian speakers    while the total number of Italian speakers, including those who use it as a second language, is about 85 million.  Italy has numerous regional dialects,  however, the establishment of a national education system has led to decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country during the 20th century. Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television (the state broadcaster RAI helped set a standard Italian).\n\nTwelve historical minority languages are legally recognised: Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian (Law number 482 of 15 December 1999).  French is co-official in the Valle d’Aosta—although in fact Franco-Provencal is more commonly spoken there.  German has the same status in South Tyrol as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino, does Ladin. Slovene is officially recognised in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine.\n\nBecause of significant recent immigration, Italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not Italian. According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics, Romanian is the most common mother tongue among foreign residents in Italy: almost 800,000 people speak Romanian as their first language (21.9% of the foreign residents aged 6 and over). Other prevalent mother tongues are Arabic (spoken by over 475,000 people; 13.1% of foreign residents), Albanian (380,000 people) and Spanish (255,000 people). Other languages spoken in Italy are Ukrainian, Hindi, Polish, and Tamil amongst others. \n\nReligion \n\nRoman Catholicism is, by far, the largest religion in the country, although Catholicism is no longer officially the state religion.   In 2010, the proportion of Italians that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 81.2%. \n\nThe Holy See, the episcopal jurisdiction of Rome, contains the central government of the entire Roman Catholic Church, including various agencies essential to administration. Diplomatically, it is recognised by other subjects of international law as a sovereign entity, headed by the Pope, who is also the Bishop of Rome, with which diplomatic relations can be maintained.   Often incorrectly referred to as \"the Vatican\", the Holy See is not the same entity as the Vatican City State, which came into existence only in 1929; the Holy See dates back to early Christian times. Ambassadors are officially accredited not to the Vatican City State but to \"the Holy See\", and papal representatives to states and international organisations are recognised as representing the Holy See, not the Vatican City State.\n\nMinority Christian faiths in Italy include Eastern Orthodox, Waldensians and Protestant communities. In 2011, there were an estimated 1.5 million Orthodox Christians in Italy, or 2.5% of the population;  0.5 million Pentecostals and Evangelicals (of whom 0.4 million are members of the Assemblies of God), 235,685 Jehovah's Witnesses,  30,000 Waldensians,  25,000 Seventh-day Adventists, 22,000 Latter-day Saints, 15,000 Baptists (plus some 5,000 Free Baptists), 7,000 Lutherans, 4,000 Methodists (affiliated with the Waldensian Church). \n\nOne of the longest-established minority religious faiths in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in Ancient Rome since before the birth of Christ. Italy has for centuries welcomed Jews expelled from other countries, notably Spain. However, as a result of the Holocaust, about 20% of Italian Jews lost their lives.p. 403 This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed World War II, has left only a small community of around 28,400 Jews in Italy. \n\nSoaring immigration in the last two decades has been accompanied by an increase in non-Christian faiths. In 2010, there were 1.6 million Muslims in Italy, forming 2.6 percent of population. In addition, there are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent with some 70,000 Sikhs with 22 gurdwaras across the country,  70,000 Hindus, and 50,000 Buddhists.  There were an estimated 4,900 Bahá'ís in Italy in 2005. \n\nThe Italian state, as a measure to protect religious freedom, devolves shares of income tax to recognised religious communities, under a regime known as Eight per thousand (Otto per mille). Donations are allowed to Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu communities; however, Islam remains excluded, since no Muslim communities have yet signed a concordat with the Italian state.  Taxpayers who do not wish to fund a religion contribute their share to the state welfare system.\n \n\nEducation \n\nEducation in Italy is free and mandatory from ages six to sixteen,  and consists of five stages: kindergarten (scuola dell'infanzia), primary school (scuola primaria), lower secondary school (scuola secondaria di primo grado), upper secondary school (scuola secondaria di secondo grado) and university (università). \n\nPrimary education lasts eight years. The students are given a basic education in Italian, English, mathematics, natural sciences, history, geography, social studies, physical education and visual and musical arts. Secondary education lasts for five years and includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the liceo prepares students for university studies with a classical or scientific curriculum, while the istituto tecnico and the Istituto professionale prepare pupils for vocational education. In 2012, the Italian secondary education has been evalued as slightly below the OECD average, with a strong and steady improvement in science and mathematics results since 2003;  however, a wide gap exists between northern schools, which performed significantly better than the national average (among the best in the world in some subjects), and schools in the South, that had much poorer results. \n\nTertiary education in Italy is divided between public universities, private universities and the prestigious and selective superior graduate schools, such as the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. The university system in Italy is generally regarded as poor for a world cultural powerhouse, with no universities ranked among the 100 world best and only 20 among the top 500.  However, the current government has scheduled major reforms and investments in order to improve the overall internationalisation and quality of the system. \n\nHealth \n\nThe Italian state runs a universal public healthcare system since 1978.  However, healthcare is provided to all citizens and residents by a mixed public-private system. The public part is the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, which is organised under the Ministry of Health and administered on a devolved regional basis. Healthcare spending in Italy accounted for 9.2% of the national GDP in 2012, very close the OECD countries' average of 9.3%. \n\nItaly in 2000 ranked as having the world's 2nd best healthcare system,  and the world's 2nd best healthcare performance. Life expectancy in Italy is 80 for males and 85 for females, placing the country 6th in the world for life expectancy. In comparison to other Western countries, Italy has a relatively low rate of adult obesity (below 10%), probably thanks to the health benefits of the mediterranean diet. The proportion of daily smokers was 22% in 2012, down from 24.4% in 2000 but still slightly above the OECD average. Smoking in public places including bars, restaurants, night clubs and offices has been restricted to specially ventilated rooms since 2005. \n\nCulture \n\nFor centuries divided by politics and geography until its eventual unification in 1861, Italy has developed a unique culture, shaped by a multitude of regional customs and local centres of power and patronage.   During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a number of magnificent courts competed for attracting the best architects, artistis and scholars, thus producing an immense legacy of monuments, paintings, music and literature. \n\nItaly has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites (51) than any other country in the world, and has rich collections of art, culture and literature from many different periods. The country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other places during the Italian diaspora. Furthermore, the nation has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (museums, palaces, buildings, statues, churches, art galleries, villas, fountains, historic houses and archaeological remains). \n\nArchitecture \n\nItaly has a very broad and diverse architectural style, which cannot be simply classified by period, but also by region, because of Italy's division into several regional states until 1861. This has created a highly diverse and eclectic range in architectural designs.\n\nItaly is known for its considerable architectural achievements,  such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during ancient Rome, the founding of the Renaissance architectural movement in the late-14th to 16th centuries, and being the homeland of Palladianism, a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of Neoclassical architecture, and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world, notably in the UK, Australia and the US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries. Several of the finest works in Western architecture, such as the Colosseum, the Milan Cathedral and Florence cathedral, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the building designs of Venice are found in Italy.\n\nItalian architecture has also widely influenced the architecture of the world. British architect Inigo Jones, inspired by the designs of Italian buildings and cities, brought back the ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture to 17th-century England, being inspired by Andrea Palladio.  Additionally, Italianate architecture, popular abroad since the 19th century, was used to describe foreign architecture which was built in an Italian style, especially modelled on Renaissance architecture.\n\nVisual art \n\nThe history of Italian visual art is part of Western painting history. Roman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main \"styles\" or periods  and may contain the first examples of trompe-l'œil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape. \n\nPanel painting becomes more common during the Romanesque period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, Medieval art and Gothic painting became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with Cimabue and then his pupil Giotto.  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.\n\nThe Italian Renaissance is said by many to be the golden age of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like Paolo Uccello, Fra Angelico, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna, Filippo Lippi, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Titian took painting to a higher level through the use of perspective, the study of human anatomy and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his David, Pietà, Moses. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include Lorenzo Ghiberti, Luca Della Robbia, Donatello, Filippo Brunelleschi, Andrea del Verrocchio.\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the High Renaissance gave rise to a stylised art known as Mannerism. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of Piero della Francesca and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of Pontormo and the emotional intensity of El Greco. In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of Italian Baroque are Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Artemisia Gentileschi, Mattia Preti, Carlo Saraceni and Bartolomeo Manfredi. Subsequently, in the 18th century, Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Canaletto. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with Antonio Canova's nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.\n\nIn the 19th century, major Italian Romantic painters were Francesco Hayez, Giuseppe Bezzuoli and Francesco Podesti. Impressionism was brought from France to Italy by the Macchiaioli, led by Giovanni Fattori, and Giovanni Boldini; Realism by Gioacchino Toma and Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo. In the 20th century, with Futurism, primarily through the works of Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla, Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico, who exerted a strong influence on the Surrealists and generations of artists to follow.\n\nLiterature and theatre \n\nThe basis of the modern Italian language was established by the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, whose greatest work, the Divine Comedy, is considered among the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the Middle Ages. There is no shortage of celebrated literary figures in Italy: Giovanni Boccaccio, Giacomo Leopardi, Alessandro Manzoni, Torquato Tasso, Ludovico Ariosto, and Petrarch, whose best-known vehicle of expression, the sonnet, was created in Italy. \n\nProminent philosophers include Giordano Bruno, Marsilio Ficino, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Giambattista Vico. Modern literary figures and Nobel laureates are nationalist poet Giosuè Carducci in 1906, realist writer Grazia Deledda in 1926, modern theatre author Luigi Pirandello in 1936, poets Salvatore Quasimodo in 1959 and Eugenio Montale in 1975, satirist and theatre author Dario Fo in 1997. \n\nCarlo Collodi's 1883 novel, The Adventures of Pinocchio, is the most celebrated children's classic by an Italian author.\n\nItalian theatre can be traced back to the Roman tradition which was heavily influenced by the Greek; as with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists tended to adapt and translate from the Greek. For example, Seneca's Phaedra was based on that of Euripides, and many of the comedies of Plautus were direct translations of works by Menander. During the 16th century and on into the 18th century, Commedia dell'arte was a form of improvisational theatre, and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of juggling, acrobatics, and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called canovaccio.\n\nMusic \n\nFrom folk music to classical, music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.\n\nItaly's most famous composers include the Renaissance composers Palestrina and Monteverdi, the Baroque composers Scarlatti, Corelli and Vivaldi, the Classical composers Paganini and Rossini, and the Romantic composers Verdi and Puccini. Modern Italian composers such as Berio and Nono proved significant in the development of experimental and electronic music. While the classical music tradition still holds strong in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its innumerable opera houses, such as La Scala of Milan and San Carlo of Naples, and performers such as the pianist Maurizio Pollini and the late tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary music scene.\n\nItaly is widely known for being the birthplace of opera.  Italian opera was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century, in Italian cities such as Mantua and Venice. Later, works and pieces composed by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are among the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include Enrico Caruso and Alessandro Bonci.\n\nIntroduced in the early 1920s, jazz took a particularly strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the progressive rock movement of the 1970s, with bands like PFM and Goblin. Italy was also an important country in the development of disco and electronic music, with Italo disco, known for its futuristic sound and prominent usage of synthesizers and drum machines, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from Euro disco (which later went on to influence several genres such as Eurodance and Nu-disco).\n\nProducers/songwriters such as Giorgio Moroder, who won three Academy Awards for his music, were highly influential in the development of EDM (electronic dance music). Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the Sanremo Music Festival, which served as inspiration for the Eurovision song contest, and the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto. Singers such as pop diva Mina, classical crossover artist Andrea Bocelli, Grammy winner Laura Pausini, and European chart-topper Eros Ramazzotti have attained international acclaim.\n\nCinema \n\nThe history of Italian cinema began a few months after the Lumière brothers began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing Pope Leo XIII giving a blessing to the camera. The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Società Italiana Cines, the Ambrosio Film and the Itala Film. Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples. In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy. Cinema was later used by Benito Mussolini, who founded Rome's renowned Cinecittà studio for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II. \n\nAfter the war, Italian film was widely recognised and exported until an artistic decline around the 1980s. Notable Italian film directors from this period include Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, Sergio Leone, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Luchino Visconti, Michelangelo Antonioni and Dario Argento. Movies include world cinema treasures such as La dolce vita, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Bicycle Thieves. The mid-1940s to the early 1950s was the heyday of neorealist films, reflecting the poor condition of post-war Italy.  \n\nAs the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and other film genres, such as sword-and-sandal followed as spaghetti westerns, were popular in the 1960s and 1970s. In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies like Life Is Beautiful directed by Roberto Benigni, Il Postino: The Postman with Massimo Troisi and The Great Beauty directed by Paolo Sorrentino.\n\nItaly is the most awarded country at the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, with 14 awards won, 3 Special Awards and 31 nominations.\n\nSport \n\nThe most popular sport in Italy is, by far, football.  Italy's national football team (nicknamed Gli Azzurri – \"the Blues\") is one of the world's most successful team as it has won four FIFA World Cups (1934, 1938, 1982, and 2006).  Italian clubs have won 48 major European trophies, making Italy the second most successful country in European football. Italy's top-flight club football league, Serie A, ranks as the fourth best in Europe and is followed by millions of fans around the world.\n\nOther popular team sports in Italy include volleyball, basketball and rugby. Italy's male and female national teams are often featured among the world's best. The Italian national basketball team's best results were gold at Eurobasket 1983 and EuroBasket 1999, as well as silver at the Olympics in 2004. Lega Basket Serie A is widely considered one of the most competitive in Europe. Rugby union enjoys a good level of popularity, especially in the north of the country. Italy's national team competes in the Six Nations Championship, and is a regular at the Rugby World Cup. Italy ranks as a tier-one nation by World Rugby.\n\nItaly has a long and successful tradition in individual sports as well. Bicycle racing is a very familiar sport in the country.  Italians have won the UCI World Championships more than any other country, except Belgium. The Giro d'Italia is a cycling race held every May, and constitutes one of the three Grand Tours, along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, each of which last approximately three weeks. Alpine skiing is also a very widespread sport in Italy, and the country is a popular international skiing destination, known for its ski resorts.   Italian skiers achieved good results in Winter Olympic Games, Alpine Ski World Cup, and World Championship. Tennis has a significant following in Italy, ranking as the fourth most practised sport in the country.  The Rome Masters, founded in 1930, is one of the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world. Italian professional tennis players won the Davis Cup in 1976 and the Fed Cup in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2013. Motorsports are also extremely popular in Italy. Italy has won, by far, the most MotoGP World Championships. Italian Scuderia Ferrari is the oldest surviving team in Grand Prix racing, having competed since 1948, and statistically the most successful Formula One team in history with a record of 224 wins.\n\nHistorically, Italy has been successful in the Olympic Games, taking part from the first Olympiad and in 47 Games out of 48. Italian sportsmen have won 522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 106 at the Winter Olympic Games, for a combined total of 628 medals with 235 golds, which makes them the fifth most successful nation in Olympic history for total medals. The country hosted two Winter Olympics (in 1956 and 2006), and one Summer games (in 1960).\n\nFashion and design \n\nItalian fashion has a long tradition, and is regarded as one most important in the world. Milan, Florence and Rome are Italy's main fashion capitals. According to Top Global Fashion Capital Rankings 2013 by Global Language Monitor, Rome ranked sixth worldwide when Milan was twelfth.  Major Italian fashion labels, such as Gucci, Armani, Prada, Versace, Valentino, Dolce & Gabbana, Missoni, Fendi, Moschino, Max Mara, Trussardi, and Ferragamo, to name a few, are regarded as among the finest fashion houses in the world. Also, the fashion magazine Vogue Italia, is considered one of the most prestigious fashion magazines in the world. \n\nItaly is also prominent in the field of design, notably interior design, architectural design, industrial design and urban design. The country has produced some well-known furniture designers, such as Gio Ponti and Ettore Sottsass, and Italian phrases such as \"Bel Disegno\" and \"Linea Italiana\" have entered the vocabulary of furniture design.  Examples of classic pieces of Italian white goods and pieces of furniture include Zanussi's washing machines and fridges,  the \"New Tone\" sofas by Atrium, and the post-modern bookcase by Ettore Sottsass, inspired by Bob Dylan's song \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\".\n\nToday, Milan and Turin are the nation's leaders in architectural design and industrial design. The city of Milan hosts Fiera Milano, Europe's largest design fair.  Milan also hosts major design and architecture-related events and venues, such as the \"Fuori Salone\" and the Salone del Mobile, and has been home to the designers Bruno Munari, Lucio Fontana, Enrico Castellani and Piero Manzoni. \n\nCuisine \n\nModern Italian cuisine has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Italian cuisine in itself takes heavy influences, including Etruscan, ancient Greek, ancient Roman, Byzantine, and  Jewish.  Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World with the introduction of items such as potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.   Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity,    abundance of difference in taste, and is known to be one of the most popular in the world,  wielding strong influence abroad. \n\nThe Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables and characterised by its extreme simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients.  Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.  Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by chefs, so many recipes are ideally suited for home cooking, this being one of the main reasons behind the ever increasing worldwide popularity of Italian cuisine, from America  to Asia.  Ingredients and dishes vary widely by region.\n\nA key factor in the success of Italian cuisine is its heavy reliance on traditional products; Italy has the most traditional specialities protected under EU law.  Cheese, cold cuts and wine are a major part of Italian cuisine, with many regional declinations and Protected Designation of Origin or Protected Geographical Indication labels, and along with coffee (especially espresso) make up a very important part of the Italian gastronomic culture.  Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon. Gelato,  tiramisù  and cassata are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes and patisserie.",
                "The European Union (EU) is a politico-economic union of  member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of  , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade,  agriculture,  fisheries, and regional development.  Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished.  A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.\n\nThe EU operates through a hybrid system of supranational and intergovernmental decision-making.   The seven principal decision-making bodies—known as the institutions of the European Union—are the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the European Court of Auditors.\n\nThe EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by the Inner Six countries in 1951 and 1958, respectively. The community and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. While no member state has, as yet, ever left the EU, a non-binding referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016 supported leaving. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union in 1993 and introduced European citizenship. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.\n\nCovering 7.3% of the world population,  the EU in 2014 generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of 18.495 trillion US dollars, constituting approximately 24% of global nominal GDP and 17% when measured in terms of purchasing power parity.  Additionally, 26 out of 28 EU countries have a very high Human Development Index, according to the United Nations Development Program. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the EU has developed a role in external relations and defence. The union maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G8, and the G-20. Because of its global influence, the European Union has been described as a current or as a potential superpower. \n\nHistory\n\nPreliminary (194557)\n\nAfter World War II, European integration was seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which had devastated the continent.  The 1948 Hague Congress was a pivotal moment in European federal history, as it led to the creation of the European Movement International and of the College of Europe, where Europe's future leaders would live and study together.  1952 saw the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, which was declared to be \"a first step in the federation of Europe.\"  The supporters of the Community included Alcide De Gasperi, Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman, and Paul-Henri Spaak. \n\nTreaty of Rome (195792)\n\nIn 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community (EEC) and established a customs union. They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for co-operation in developing nuclear energy. Both treaties came into force in 1958.\n\nThe EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC, although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly.  The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then Étienne Hirsch. Euratom was to integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union among members.  \n\nThrough the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities.   Jean Rey presided over the first merged Commission (Rey Commission). \n\nIn 1973, the Communities enlarged to include Denmark (including Greenland, which later left the Community in 1985, following a dispute over fishing rights), Ireland, and the United Kingdom.  Norway had negotiated to join at the same time, but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum. In 1979, the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held. \n\nGreece joined in 1981, Portugal and Spain following in 1986.  In 1985, the Schengen Agreement paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states.  In 1986, the European flag began to be used by the Community  and the Single European Act was signed.\n\nIn 1990, after the fall of the Eastern Bloc, the former East Germany became part of the Community as part of a reunified Germany.  With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993.\n\nMaastricht Treaty (1992–present) \n\nThe European Union was formally established when the Maastricht Treaty—whose main architects were Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand—came into force on 1 November 1993.  The treaty also gave the name European Community to the EEC, even if it was referred as such before the treaty. In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU. In 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the eurozone has increased to encompass 19 countries. In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined the Union. In 2007, Romania and Bulgaria became EU members. The same year, Slovenia adopted the euro, followed in 2008 by Cyprus and Malta, by Slovakia in 2009, by Estonia in 2011, by Latvia in 2014 and by Lithuania in 2015.\n\nOn 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the European Union, merging the EU three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with a legal personality, created a permanent President of the European Council, the first of which was Herman Van Rompuy, and strengthened the position of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for having \"contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy, and human rights in Europe.\"   In 2013, Croatia became the 28th EU member.   \n\nFrom the beginning of 2010s, the European Union is going through a series of tests, including a debt crisis in some Eurozone countries, increasing migration from Middle Eastern countries, Russian military intervention in Ukraine and the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.\n\nStructural evolution\n\nThe following timeline illustrates the integration that has led to the formation of the present union, in terms of structural development driven by international treaties:\n\nBritish withdrawal\n\nA referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union (announced by British Prime Minister David Cameron on 20 February 2016) was held on 23 June 2016, following years of campaigning by eurosceptics. The result gave a majority of with 51.9% to leave, and 48.1% to remain, on a turnout of 72.2% of registered voters. , the UK has not yet initiated the formal withdrawal procedure, and will not leave the EU until either two years after they notify the European Council of their decision to withdraw, or on the coming into force of a withdrawal agreement.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36618317 EU Brexit referendum: UK 'must not delay leaving'], BBC News. Retrieved 24 June 2016.\n\nGeography\n\nThe EU's member states cover an area of 4423147 km2.This figure includes the extra-European territories of member states which are part of the European Union and excludes the European territories of member states which are not part of the Union. For more information see Special member state territories and the European Union. The EU's highest peak is Mont Blanc in the Graian Alps,  above sea level.  The lowest points in the EU are Lammefjorden, Denmark and Zuidplaspolder, Netherlands, at 7 m (23 ft) below sea level. \nThe landscape, climate, and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline, which is 65993 km long.\n\nIncluding the overseas territories of France which are located outside the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most types of climate from Arctic (North-East Europe) to tropical (French Guyana), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate maritime climate (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a Mediterranean climate (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or hemiboreal climate (Northern Balkans and Central Europe). \n\nThe EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75% of inhabitants (and growing, projected to be 90% in seven member states by 2020) living in urban areas. Cities are largely spread out across the EU, although with a large grouping in and around the Benelux. An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas. In some cases, this urban growth has been due to the influx of EU funds into a region. \n\nMember states\n\nThrough successive enlargements, the European Union has grown from the six founding states—Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands—to the current . Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as \"pooling of sovereignty\".  \n\nTo become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.  No member state has yet left the Union, although Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985.  The Lisbon Treaty now contains a clause under Article 50, providing for a member to leave the EU.  On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted by referendum to leave the EU. However, it remains a member until it officially exits, and has not yet begun formal withdrawal procedures.\n\nThere are six countries that are recognized as candidates for membership: Albania, Iceland, Macedonia,Referred to by the EU as the \"former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\". Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey, though Iceland suspended negotiations in 2013.  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are officially recognised as potential candidates,  with Bosnia and Herzegovina having submitted a membership application.\n\nThe four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are not EU members, but have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties.  The relationships of the European microstates, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation.  The following  sovereign states (of which the map only shows territories situated in and around Europe) constitute the European Union: \n\nFile:Member States of the European Union (polar stereographic

had no environmental policy.  Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental protection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards and biotechnology.  According to the Institute for European Environmental Policy, environmental law comprises over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions, making environmental policy a core area of European politics. \n\nEuropean policy-makers originally increased the EU's capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem. \nTrade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state.  In subsequent years, the environment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, principles and procedures. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.\n\nInitially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol despite opposition from the United States. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme,  which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions.  EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.\n\nMitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in future, 20% of the energy used across the EU must be renewable, and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels.   The EU has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions into the economy.  The European Green Capital is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency and quality of life in urban areas to create smart city.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe European Union operates according to the principles of conferral (which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the treaties) and of subsidiarity (which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone). Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives). \n\nConstitutional nature\n\nThe classification of the EU in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated. It began life as an international organisation and gradually developed into a confederation of states. However, since the mid-1960s it has also added several of the key attributes of a federation, such as the direct effect of the law of the general level of government upon the individual  and majority voting in the decision-making process of the general level of government,  without becoming a federation per se. Scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation, being an instance of neither political structure.For example, David Marquand says it is ‘less than a federation but more than a confederation’; Brigid Laffan and Kimmo Kiljunen both see it residing ‘between a confederation and a federation’; Thomas Hueglin and Alan Fenna locate it ‘somewhere between federation and confederation’; and Kalypso Nicolaidis argues ‘it is more than a confederation of sovereign states; ... (however, it) should not become a federal state’. \nMichael Burgess enlarges: the EU 'is not a federation but it is also more than a confederation understood in the classical sense. It exists, then, in a kind of conceptual limbo, a twilight zone ... which has no name'. \nPaul Magnette illuminates the nature of the perceived 'in-betweenness': 'Since the seventeenth century, legal theorists have repeated that only two forms of union between states are possible: either the confederation, born of an international treaty concluded between sovereign states, where all decisions are unanimously adopted by state representatives; or the federal state, established by a constitution, where the law voted on by a bicameral parliament applies directly to the citizens. Tertium non datur. There is no third way ... In these, classic, political terms, the European Union is, strictly speaking, inconceivable'. \nBurgess, Michael (2000) Federalism and European Union: The Building of Europe 1950-2000, Routledge, London, pp. 41-2.

For this reason, the organisation is termed sui generis (incomparable, one of a kind),  although some argue that this designation is no longer valid. \n\nThe organisation has traditionally used the terms \"Community\" and later \"Union\" to describe itself. The difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law (where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations) and international law (where the subjects include sovereign states and international organizations). They can also be seen in the light of differing European and American constitutional traditions. \nEspecially in terms of the European tradition, the term federation is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law; so the EU cannot be called a federation — at least, not without qualification. It is, however, described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature; and so it may be appropriate to consider it a federal union of states, a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of states and the federal state.For the derivation of this concept, see the Introduction of the entry on Federalism. \nLaw, John (2013) [http://www.on-federalism.eu/attachments/169_download.pdf \"How Can We Define Federalism?\"]. Perspectives on Federalism, Vol. 5, No. 3, p. E104. The German Constitutional Court refers to the EU as a Staatenverbund, an intermediate structure between the Staatenbund (confederation of states) and the Bundesstaat (federal state), consistent with this concept. \nThis may be a long-lived political form. Professor Andrew Moravcsik claims that the EU is unlikely to develop further into a federal state, but instead has reached maturity as a constitutional system. \n\nGovernance\n\nThe European Union has seven institutions: the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors. Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.\n\nEuropean Council\n\nThe European Council gives political direction to the EU. It convenes at least four times a year and comprises the President of the European Council (currently Donald Tusk), the President of the European Commission and one representative per member state (either its head of state or head of government). The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini) also takes part in its meetings. It has been described by some as the Union's \"supreme political authority\".  It is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.\n\nThe European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts externally as a \"collective head of state\" and ratifies important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).[https://books.google.com/books?idaMsWxEnaqrUC&pg\nPA146 With US or against US?: European trends in American perspective] Parsons, Jabko. European Union Studies Association, p.146:Fourth, the European Council acts a \"collective head of state\" for the EU.\n\nTasks for the President of the European Council are ensuring the external representation of the EU,  driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states, both during meetings of the European Council and over the periods between them.\n\nThe European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe, an international organisation independent of the EU based in Strasbourg.\n\nCouncil of the European Union\n\nThe Council of the European Union (also called the \"Council\"  and the \"Council of Ministers\", its former title)  forms one half of the EU's legislature. It consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body.  In addition to its legislative functions, the Council also exercises executive functions in relations to the Common Foreign and Security Policy.\n\nEuropean Parliament\n\nThe European Parliament forms the other half of the EU's legislature.\nThe 751 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation. Although MEPs are elected on a national basis, they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub-national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system. \n\nThe European Parliament and the Council of the European Union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure. This also applies to the EU budget. The European Commission is accountable to Parliament, requiring its approval to take office, having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it. The President of the European Parliament (currently Martin Schulz) carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally. The President and Vice-Presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years. \n\nEuropean Commission\n\nThe European Commission acts as the EU's executive arm and is responsible for initiating legislation and the day-to-day running of the EU. The Commission is also seen as the motor of European integration. It operates as a cabinet government, with 28 Commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.\n\nOne of the 28 is the President of the European Commission (currently Jean-Claude Juncker) appointed by the European Council. After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is ex-officio a Vice-President of the Commission and is also chosen by the European Council.  The other 26 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council of the European Union in agreement with the nominated President. The 28 Commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament.\n\nBudget\n\nThe EU had an agreed budget of €120.7 billion for the year 2007 and €864.3 billion for the period 2007–2013,  representing 1.10% and 1.05% of the EU-27's GNI forecast for the respective periods. By comparison, the United Kingdom's expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be €759 billion, and France was estimated to have spent €801 billion. In 1960, the budget of the then European Economic Community was 0.03% of GDP. \n\nIn the 2010 budget of €141.5 billion, the largest single expenditure item is \"cohesion & competitiveness\" with around 45% of the total budget.  Next comes \"agriculture\" with approximately 31% of the total. \"Rural development, environment and fisheries\" takes up around 11%. \"Administration\" accounts for around 6%. The \"EU as a global partner\" and \"citizenship, freedom, security and justice\" bring up the rear with approximately 6% and 1% respectively.\n\nThe Court of Auditors is legally obliged to provide the Parliament and the Council with \"a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions\".  The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.  The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget.\n\nThe European Court of Auditors has signed off the European Union accounts every year since 2007 and, while making it clear that the European Commission has more work to do, has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level.   In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, agriculture and the cohesion fund, were materially affected by error.  The European Commission estimated in 2009 that the financial effect of irregularities was €1,863 million. \n\nCompetences\n\nEU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws. \n\nThat a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.\n\nThe distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories:\n\nLegal system\n\nThe EU is based on a series of treaties. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.  These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislationSee Article 288 (ex Article 249 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uriOJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu] which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.According to the principle of Direct Effect first invoked in the Court of Justice's decision in  See: Craig and de Búrca, ch. 5. The EU has legal personality, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties. \n\nUnder the principle of supremacy, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.According to the principle of Supremacy as established by the ECJ in Case 6/64, Falminio Costa v. ENEL [1964] ECR 585. See Craig and de Búrca, ch. 7. See also: Factortame litigation: Factortame Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603, Solange II (Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft, BVerfG decision of 22 October 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265) and Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze [1974] 2 CMLR 372; Raoul George Nicolo [1990] 1 CMLR 173.\n\nCourts of Justice\n\nThe judicial branch of the EU—formally called the Court of Justice of the European Union—consists of three courts: the Court of Justice, the General Court, and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal. Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU. \n\nThe Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and cases referred to it by the courts of member states.  The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts,  and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and its civil service.  Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law. \n\nFundamental rights\n\nThe treaties declare that the EU itself is \"founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities ... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.\" \n\nIn 2009 the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the \"constitutional traditions common to the member states.\"  The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights. \n\nAlthough signing the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership,It is effectively treated as one of the Copenhagen criteria, [http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link\n/Documents/AdoptedText/ta08/ERES1610.htm Assembly.coe.int.] It should be noted that this is a political and not a legal requirement for membership.  previously, the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a stateThe European Convention on Human Rights was previously only open to members of the Council of Europe ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm Article 59.1 of the Convention]), and even now only states may become member of the Council of Europe ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/001.htm Article 4 of the Statute of the Council of Europe]). nor had the competence to accede.Opinion (2/92) of the European Court of Justice on \"Accession by the Community to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\" [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994V0002:FR:NOT 1996 E.C.R. I-1759] (in French), ruled that the European Community did not have the competence to accede to the ECHR. The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it.\n\nAlthough, the EU is independent from Council of Europe, they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law, human rights and democracy. Further European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter, the source of law of Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by Council of Europe. The EU also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership. \n\nActs\n\nThe main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: regulations, directives, and decisions. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,See: Case 34/73, Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri\nCELEX:61973J0034:EN:NOT [1973] ECR 981]. and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions. Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 28 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115 When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states.\n\nDecisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in competition law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy. \n\nArea of freedom, security and justice\n\nSince the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of freedom, security and justice, initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: Europol for co-operation of police forces,  Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors,  and Frontex for co-operation between border control authorities.  The EU also operates the Schengen Information System which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the Schengen Agreement and the associated cross border crime.\n\nFurthermore, the Union has legislated in areas such as extradition,  family law,  asylum law,  and criminal justice.  Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.See Articles 157 (ex Article 141) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uriOJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu] In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.See Article 2(7) of the Amsterdam Treaty on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 eur-lex.europa.eu]  By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work-place, age discrimination, and racial discrimination.Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19 July 2000, p. 22–26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2 December 2000, p. 16–22).\n\nForeign relations\n\nForeign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the Common Commercial policy.  Steps for a more wide ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act. EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty. \n\nThe aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.  The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq. \n\nThe coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The High Representative heads up the European External Action Service (EEAS), a unique EU department  that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.  The EEAS will serve as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the European Union. \n\nBesides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through enlargement. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries.  This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as \"soft power\", as opposed to military \"hard power\".\n\nMilitary\n\nThe predecessors of the European Union were not devised as a military alliance because NATO was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes. 22 EU members are members of NATO  while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality.  The Western European Union, a military alliance with a mutual defence clause, was disbanded in 2010 as its role had been transferred to the EU. \n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the United Kingdom spent $61 billion on defence in 2014, placing it fifth in the world, while France spent $53 billion, the sixth largest.  Together, the UK and France account for approximately 40 per cent of EU's defence budget and 50 per cent of its military capacity.  Both are officially recognised nuclear weapon states holding permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.\n\nFollowing the Kosovo War in 1999, the European Council agreed that \"the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO\". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 personnel. \n\nEU forces have been deployed on peacekeeping missions from middle and northern Africa to the western Balkans and western Asia.  EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies, including the European Defence Agency, European Union Satellite Centre and the European Union Military Staff.  Frontex is an agency of the EU established to manage the cooperation between national border guards securing its external borders. It aims to detect and stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration. In December 2015 the European Commission presented its proposal for a new European Border and Coast Guard Agency having a stronger role and mandate along with national authorities for border management. In an EU consisting of 28 members, substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states. \n\nHumanitarian aid\n\nThe European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department, or \"ECHO\", provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. In 2012, its budget amounted to €874 million, 51% of the budget went to Africa and 20% to Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Pacific, and 20% to the Middle East and Mediterranean. \n\nHumanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70%) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund (30%).Mikaela Gavas 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id\n5078&titleeuropean-development-cooperation-financial-perspectives Financing European development cooperation: the Financial Perspectives 2014–2020.] London: Overseas Development Institute The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments. The 'geographic' instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI, €16.9 billion, 2007–2013), which must spend 95% of its budget on overseas development assistance (ODA), and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes. The European Development Fund (EDF, €22.7 bn, 2008–2013) is made up of voluntary contributions by member states, but there is pressure to merge the EDF into the budget-financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0.7% target and allow the European Parliament greater oversight.\n\nHowever, five countries have reached the 0.7% target: Sweden, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom.   In 2011, EU aid was 0.42% of the EU's GNI making it the world's most generous aid donor.  The previous Commissioner for Aid, Louis Michel, has called for aid to be delivered more rapidly, to greater effect, and on humanitarian principles. \n\nEconomy\n\nThe five largest economies in the world according to the IMF by nominal GDP in 2014. \n\nThe European Union has established a single market across the territory of all its members representing 508 million citizens. In 2014, the EU had a combined GDP of 18.640 trillion international dollars, a 20% share of global gross domestic product by purchasing power parity (PPP).  As a political entity the European Union is represented in the World Trade Organization (WTO). EU member states own the estimated largest net wealth in the world, equal to 30% of the $223 trillion global wealth.\n\n19 member states have joined a monetary union known as the eurozone, which uses the Euro as a single currency. The currency union represents 338 million EU citizens. The euro is the second largest reserve currency as well as the second most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar.   \n\nOf the top 500 largest corporations in the world measured by revenue in 2010, 161 have their headquarters in the EU.  In 2016, unemployment in the EU stood at 8.9%  while inflation was at 2.2%, and the current account balance at −0.9% of GDP.\n\nThere is a significant variance for GDP (PPP) per capita within individual EU states. The difference between the richest and poorest regions (276 NUTS-2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) ranged, in 2014, from 30% of the EU28 average to 539%, or from €8,200 to €148,000 (about US$9,000 to US$162,000).\n\nStructural Funds and Cohesion Funds are supporting the development of underdeveloped regions of the EU. Such regions are primarily located in the states of central and southern Europe.   Several funds provide emergency aid, support for candidate members to transform their country to conform to the EU's standard (Phare, ISPA, and SAPARD), and support to the Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS). TACIS has now become part of the worldwide EuropeAid programme. EU research and technological framework programmes sponsor research conducted by consortia from all EU members to work towards a single European Research Area. \n\nInternal market\n\nTwo of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently becoming a single market, and a customs union between its member states. The single market involves the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU,  and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union.  Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU. \n\nFree movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.  Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.\n\nThe free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states. \n\nThe free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed Directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.  According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.\n\nMonetary union\n\nThe creation of a European single currency became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the Maastricht Treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union. The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.\n\nIn 1999 the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with eleven member states joining. In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries. \n\nSince its launch the euro has become the second reserve currency in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro.  The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the European Central Bank (ECB). \n\nThe ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability. It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks, which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the President of the ECB, who is appointed by the European Council, the Vice-President of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 28 EU member states. \n\nThe European System of Financial Supervision is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. To complement this framework, there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the ECB. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU. \n\nTo prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level.\n\nEnergy\n\nIn 2006, the EU-27 had a gross inland energy consumption of 1,825 million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). Around 46% of the energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54% was imported. In these statistics, nuclear energy is treated as primary energy produced in the EU, regardless of the source of the uranium, of which less than 3% is produced in the EU.  Nuclear energy and renewable energy are treated differently from oil, gas , and coal in this respect.\n\nThe EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007. \n\nThe EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia  and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.\n\nThe EU imports 82% of its oil, 57% of its natural gas  and 97.48% of its uranium demands. Because of Europe's dependence on Russian energy the EU is attempting to diversify its energy supply. \n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe EU is working to improve cross-border infrastructure within the EU, for example through the Trans-European Networks (TEN). Projects under TEN include the Channel Tunnel, LGV Est, the Fréjus Rail Tunnel, the Öresund Bridge, the Brenner Base Tunnel and the Strait of Messina Bridge. In 2010 the estimated network covers: 75200 km of roads; 78000 km of railways; 330 airports; 270 maritime harbours; and 210 internal harbours.  \n\nRail transport in Europe is being synchronised with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), an initiative to greatly enhance safety, increase efficiency of trains and enhance cross-border interoperability of rail transport in Europe by replacing signalling equipment with digitized mostly wireless versions and by creating a single Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems.\n\nThe developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.  The Polish road network was upgraded such as the A4 autostrada.  \n\nThe Galileo positioning system is another EU infrastructure project. Galileo is a proposed Satellite navigation system, to be built by the EU and launched by the European Space Agency (ESA). The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the EU's dependency on the US-operated Global Positioning System, but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for greater accuracy, given the aged nature of the GPS system. \n\nAgriculture\n\nThe Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is one of the long lasting policies of the European Community.  The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers.Article 39 (ex Article 33) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri\nOJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu] It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60% of the then European Community's annual budget, and  accounts for around 34%. \n\nThe policy's price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction. These were intervention stores of products bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the developing world.  Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.\n\nSince the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels. One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU. \n\nCompetition\n\nThe EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.Article 3(1)(g) of the Treaty of Rome The Commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues, approving mergers, breaking up cartels, working for economic liberalisation and preventing state aid. \n\nThe Competition Commissioner, currently Margrethe Vestager, is one of the most powerful positions in the Commission, notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans-national corporations.  For example, in 2001 the Commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States (GE and Honeywell) which had already been approved by their national authority.  Another high-profile case against Microsoft, resulted in the Commission fining Microsoft over €777 million following nine years of legal action. \n\nDemographics\n\nAs of 1 January 2016, the population of the European Union is about 510.1 million people. In 2013, 5,075,000 live births were registered and 4,999,200 deaths. The net migration to the EU was +653,100. In 2010, 47.3 million people who lived in the EU were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million), Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million). \n\nUrbanisation\n\nThe EU contains 16 cities with populations of over one million. Besides many large cities, the EU also includes several densely populated regions that have no single core but have emerged from the connection of several cities and now encompass large metropolitan areas. The largest are Rhine-Ruhr having approximately 11.5 million inhabitants (Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf et al.), Randstad approx. 7 million (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht et al.), Frankfurt Rhine-Main approx. 5.8 million (Frankfurt, Wiesbaden et al.), the Flemish Diamond approx. 5.5 million (urban area in between Antwerp, Brussels, Leuven and Ghent), Upper Silesia approx. 5.3 million (Katowice, Ostrava) and Øresund approx. 3.7 million (Copenhagen, Malmö). \n\nLanguages\n\nAmong the many languages and dialects used in the EU, it has 24 official and working languages: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish.   Important documents, such as legislation, are translated into every official language.\n\nThe European Parliament provides translation into all languages for documents and its plenary sessions.  Some institutions use only a handful of languages as internal working languages.  Catalan, Galician, Basque, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh are not official languages of the EU but have semi-official status in that official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens of the EU have the right to correspond with the institutions using them.\n\nLanguage policy is the responsibility of member states, but EU institutions promote the learning of other languages.See Articles 165 and 166 (ex Articles 149 and 150) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri\nOJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]  English is the most widely spoken language in the EU, being spoken by 51% of the EU population when counting both native and non-native speakers.  German is the most widely spoken mother tongue, being spoken by 16% of the EU population. 56% of EU citizens are able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue.  Most official languages of the EU belong to the Indo-European language family, except Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, which belong to the Uralic language family, and Maltese, which is a Semitic language. Most EU official languages are written in the Latin alphabet except Bulgarian, which is written in the Cyrillic alphabet, and Greek, which is written in the Greek alphabet.  These are the three official scripts of the European Union. \n\nBesides the 24 official languages, there are about 150 regional and minority languages, spoken by up to 50 million people. Although EU programmes can support regional and minority languages, the protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the individual member states. The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage.\n\nThe European Day of Languages is held annually on 26 September and is aimed at encouraging language learning across Europe.\n\nReligion\n\nThe EU is a secular body with no formal connection to any religion. The Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognises the \"status under national law of churches and religious associations\" as well as that of \"philosophical and non-confessional organisations\".\n\nThe preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the \"cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe\".  Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or God, or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped. \n\nChristians in the EU are divided among members of Catholicism (both Roman and Eastern Rite), numerous Protestant denominations, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 2009, the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13 million,  and an estimated Jewish population of over a million.  The other world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism and Sikhism are also represented in the EU population.\n\nAccording to new polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Christianity is the largest religion in the European Union, accounting for 72% of the EU population. Catholics are the largest Christian group, accounting for 48% of the EU population, while Protestants make up 12%, Eastern Orthodox make up 8% and other Christians make up 4%. \n\nEurostat's Eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52% of EU citizens believed in a God, 27% in \"some sort of spirit or life force\", and 18% had no form of belief.  Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years.  The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16%) and the Czech Republic (19%). The most religious countries were Malta (95%, predominantly Roman Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90% of citizens professing a belief in God. Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16 and those \"positioning themselves on the right of the political scale\".\n\nEducation and science\n\nBasic education is an area where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20 years, it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life. \n\nThere are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.   Through its support of the Bologna Process, the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.\n\nScientific development is facilitated through the EU's Framework Programmes, the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent European Research Council allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.  EU research and technological framework programmes deal in a number of areas, for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels. \n\nHealth care\n\nAlthough the EU has no major competences in the field of health care, Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms that \"A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities\". The European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumers seeks to align national laws on the protection of people's health, on the consumers' rights, on the safety of food and other products.   \n\nHealth care in the EU is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level. The systems are primarily publicly funded through taxation (universal health care). Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private (non-subsidised) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance.\n\nAll EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free European Health Insurance Card which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries.  A directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting co-operation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for European patients.   \n\nCulture \n\nCultural co-operation between member states has been a concern of the EU since its inclusion as a community competency in the Maastricht Treaty.  Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the Culture 2000 7-year programme, the European Cultural Month event,  the MEDIA Programme,  and orchestras such as the European Union Youth Orchestra.\n\nThe European Capital of Culture programme selects one or more cities in every year to assist the cultural development of that city.  53 EU cities have been part of this initiative up to 2016.\n\nSport\n\nSport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. However, there are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the Bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship.  The Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity.  This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport, which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.  The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project. \n\nAssociation Football is the most popular sport in almost all EU countries. Club teams from the EU are the highest paid in the world. Other team sports like rugby, ice hockey, basketball, cricket, handball, volleyball and water polo are also popular in some member states.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe flag of the Union consists of a circle of 12 golden stars on a blue background. The blue represents the West, while the number and position of the stars represent completeness and unity, respectively.  Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag was adopted by the European Communities, the predecessors of the present Union, in 1986.\n\nUnited in Diversity was adopted as the motto of the Union in the year 2000, having been selected from proposals submitted by school pupils. Since 1985, the flag day of the Union has been Europe Day, on 9 May (the date of the 1950 Schuman declaration). The anthem of the Union is an instrumental version of the prelude to the Ode to Joy, the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony. The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions. \n\nBesides naming the continent, the Greek mythological figure of Europa has frequently been employed as a personification of Europe. Known from the myth in which Zeus seduces her in the guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present Union. Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the Union's institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of Euro banknotes. The bull is, for its part, depicted on all residence permit cards.\n\nCharles the Great, also known as Charlemagne () and later recognized as Pater Europae (\"Father of Europe\"),      has a symbolic relevance to Europe. The Commission has named one of its central buildings in Brussels after Charlemagne and the city of Aachen has since 1949 awarded the Charlemagne Prize to champions of European unification.  Since 2008, the organisers of this prize, in conjunction with the European Parliament, have awarded the Charlemagne Youth Prize in recognition of similar efforts by young people. \n\nMedia \n\nMedia freedom is a fundamental right that applies to all member states of the European Union and its citizens, as defined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as well as the European Convention on Human Rights.  Within the EU enlargement process, guaranteeing media freedom is named a \"key indicator of a country's readiness to become part of the EU\"."

                "Shorn Again Believers: Colors: The human eye is most sensitive to GREEN\nColors: The human eye is most sensitive to GREEN\nIMPORTANCE OF COLOR\nAmong the eyes of Nature, the human eye is designed to distinguish colors.  Cats eyes, for example are much better at detecting movement, the condor can see \"death\", and the dog can \"read\" our faces better than we can.  But for colors, we seem to have   the leading specimen eye.  And among the colors, which ones do we seem most keen to observe?\nMore than any other color, we see green. Since color is a major quality factor to human beings, the fact that we are more sensitive to green than to other colors, must be significant.  And what IS it about GREEN?\nIn terms of dialectic, it is not associated with an \"opposite\" -- such as \"black and white\", or \"blue and red\".  It is not a primary color, but is the mix of blue and yellow.  So why does our eye especially read for green?\nTHE \"GREEN SENSITIVITY\"\nIs WHAT is green the important thing? -- the grass, the garden, the tree -- or is the prejudice merely the coincidence of the particular pigment or light wave to the shape of our eye?  In all the perlustrations of color before us, in the parade of shade and light, is there an explanation for our green proclivity?\nTHE EYE\nBecause the sensitivity is indifferent to whether the green is pigmentation or wave length, solid or light, it is probable that our brain, not the naked physics of the peep-hole, the optic orb, is cue-ing the green. One test of this would be further experiments with creatures with eyes which are similar to human eyes -- such as squid, or even other primates.  Do they have the same sensitivity, and can we test this differentiation?  Squid live in an environment in which there is almost no ambient \"green\" light and few enough chorophylic plants, compared with the non-aquatic species.\nGREEN THINGS\nAssuming the brain is the organ which holds the sensitivity and is prejudiced in favor of the color green, is there anything about green things which explains the predisposition?\nPLANTS.  We do seem to take comfort in Gardens.  It is almost an embarrassment how we putter in them -- and this is not simply explained as an association with our food sources.  We rarely eat the foliage and flowers which populate our Gardens -- hanging and otherwise.\nGRASS.  The word for the color Green stems etymologically from \"growing grass\" -- compare CGerm/Goth \"gronjaz\".  It is the color of growing, the fresh, young, unripe, immature and living forms.  It seems curious that no fruit gets green with age, and meats which green do so because of new growth of bacteria and mold upon them. The primordial grassland, or open veldt, may at least partially be reflected in the origin of the word and its cognates -- greenery, greening, greensward, greenhorn (new ox).\nEMERALD JEWEL. Emeralds are green, and are long and fondly regarded as the Queen of all precious gemstones.  Emeralds adorned the Pharaohs of Egypt over 3,000 years ago, and Inka craftsmen worked it into their most prized jewelry.  Of course, our attraction to a pretty rock would obtain no matter what its hue.  As Beryllium with trace chromium, vanadium, and occasionally iron, Emeralds are also extremely hard -- making them an excellent jewel impervious to wear.  Depending on Color, Clarity, Cut and Carat weight, they are more valuable by weight than diamonds, or any other stone. With respect to clarity, the natural inclusions in emeralds are often called ‘gardens’.  These gardens -- the inclusions -- make the stone green, of course, since beryl is colorless.  We draw from these green shades of jewels and gardens the descriptions of \"enchanting\" or \"mysterious\".\nSHADES.\nThe human eye detects an extraordinary range of hues and shades -- 100's of thousands. Eye detection of green chromaticity appears to be scaled on par with other colors.  This seems odd in light of the Color Chart, your rainbow of primary and secondary colors, and the Green Sensitivity.\nConsider the various virescent Chlorochrous hues:\nBright or vivid green (emerald, smaragdine, day-glo, citrine);\nLight green (apple);\nBluish green (teal, glaucous, some cerulean or sea-green);\nYellow-green (chartreuse, avocado, Kelly, leek, hunter, Nile, absinthe, pistachio,\nverdegris, pea, grass, leaf, malachite, moss);\nGold-green (chrysochlorous);",
                "Eye's Response to Light\n-\nThe Human Eye's Response to Light\nThe three curves in the figure above shows the normalized response of an average human eye to various amounts of ambient light. The shift in sensitivity occurs because two types of photoreceptors called cones and rods are responsible for the eye's response to light. The curve on the right shows the eye's response under normal lighting conditions and this is called the photopic response. The cones respond to light under these conditions.\nAs mentioned previously, cones are composed of three different photo pigments that enable color perception. This curve peaks at 555 nanometers, which means that under normal lighting conditions, the eye is most sensitive to a yellowish-green color. When the light levels drop to near total darkness, the response of the eye changes significantly as shown by the scotopic response curve on the left.  At this level of light, the rods are most active and the human eye is more sensitive to the light present, and less sensitive to the range of color.  Rods are highly sensitive to light but are comprised of a single photo pigment, which accounts for the loss in ability to discriminate color. At this very low light level, sensitivity to blue, violet, and ultraviolet is increased, but sensitivity to yellow and red is reduced. The heavier curve in the middle represents the eye's response at the ambient light level found in a typical inspection booth. This curve peaks at 550 nanometers, which means the eye is most sensitive to yellowish-green color at this light level. Fluorescent penetrant inspection materials are designed to fluoresce at around 550 nanometers to produce optimal sensitivity under dim lighting conditions.\nReferences:\nRobinson, S.

OP needs a better contrast setting in your game design, not better sensitivity to the visual object.\nGenerally there are two kinds of contrast: the contrast of brightness and the contrast of color.\nThe contrast of brightness depends on the ratio of brightness between visual object and background. For a light source with pulse wavelength, ~555 nm is the most sensitive to your eyes in brightness, which means that the object with this wavelength in dark background should have the highest contrast subjectively.\nThe contrast of color depends on the wavelength difference between the object and background. The human eyes are more sensitive for the difference between RED and GREEN.\nIf you have a mixed color on the background, the best contrast for the object should be some color between ~555 nm and red. That's why \"optical yellow\" is good color for tennis ball on TV.\n0\n1,608 posts\nPosted 7 April 2011 - 05:44 AM\nI can't find an answer to what hue of green/yellow exactly is the human eye most senstivite to (in RGB).\nLuminous flux/intensity are defined at ~555 nm (540 THz), because that's the peak sensitivity of photopic\nscotopic\nvision.\nLime green (#BFFF00) corresponds roughly to 564 nm.

This means that the human eye can distinguish more shades of that color than any other.  We can, in other words, spot an enemy wearing some shade of yellow-green on a different shade yellow-green background better than we can spot an enemy wearing some shade of red on a different shade red background.\nThis is why the military makes use of this color in a heads up display:\nit is the best color when the background could be anything.\nEdited by Iggy,  7 April 2011 - 02:22 PM.\n0\nPosted 7 April 2011 - 03:17 PM\nIt will be the worst color for the background color at 550 nm!\nWe need scientific understanding, not just searching.\nOk, I'm assuming that you're being sincere.  The question in the OP is worded correctly,\nI can't find an answer to what hue of green/yellow exactly is the human eye most senstivite to (in RGB)... This could be useful for stuff like enemy color in FPS games\nHe is looking for the best color of uniform in which to dress his enemy and he wants that color to be most sensitive to his sense of vision.  The color of his opponent does not change as the background changes.  It is constant.  For this reason alone, it is pointless to say \"well, for some backgrounds the color X provides the best contrast and for other backgrounds the color Y provides the best contrast\".\nThe question is rather: \"what color is best in any background?\" -- in other words, in a random background.  Scientists have studied this question.  For example, they have recommended that fire engines and other emergency vehicles should be colored lime green.  They found that tennis balls are most visible when colored lime green.\nMore than that, I looked at all three videos that the OP linked.  They have predominantly dark-colored backgrounds.\nIf you think some other specific color offers the OP a better answer then by all means... otherwise, I don't see the point of your objection or your accusation that I'm somehow avoiding \"scientific understanding\".\nEdited by Iggy,  7 April 2011 - 03:21 PM.\n0\nPosted 7 April 2011 - 03:38 PM\nOk, I'm assuming that you're being sincere.\nI am sincere as far as in this topic.\nAt first I said that the color you picked is good for the background, which you specified at 564 nm. Then you left the question from OP and said the best color should be at 550 nm, that you claimed that \"it is the best color when the background could be anything.\"\nIf you do understand the contrast of color, how can you have two different results?

The question is not \"what is the best color on a specific background?\".  The question is \"what is the best color for many different backgrounds?\".\nThen you left the question from OP and said the best color should be at 550 nm\nThe OP itself said \"550 nm\".\n, that you claimed that \"it is the best color when the background could be anything.\"\nExactly.  FPS games have a multitude of environments and backgrounds.  The point is to find an RGB color that is most visible in all of those environments with all of those backgrounds -- taken as a whole.\nhow can you have two different results?\nMost sources say \"approximately 550 nm\".  The exact wavelength which is most visible will depend on the person.  The RGB value that corresponds to that wavelength will vary widely between monitors.  If a person were a serious gamer and wanted to fine tune the color of his opponent, I would recommend getting an \"optic yellow\" tennis ball (most people probably already have one).  A person could then match the closest pure spectral color to match.\nA pure spectral color is either a single RGB primary color or a mix of red and green or green and blue.  The color we're looking for is a mix of red and green.  So, Answers may put the color #BFFF00 (the one I quoted from wiki) on his game character and see if it matches his tennis ball.\nIf it looks too yellow then he would make the \"BF\" part smaller.  BF is a hex number.  In decimal it is 191.  To drop it down to 180 he would change it to \"B4\" and the new color would be #B4FF00.  To make the color more yellow he would make the red value larger... maybe #C8FF00.\nReally, this would be the only way to find the exact RGB value that corresponds to the \"approximately 550 nm\" color that is being sought because monitors, depending on type, model, and age display very different colors.\nedited to add --->\nEdited by Iggy,  7 April 2011 - 05:56 PM.\n0\n197 posts\nPosted 7 April 2011 - 06:06 PM\nA pure spectral color is either a single RGB primary color or a mix of red and green or green and blue.\nWrong. Please look the following explanation.\nThe C.I.E. Color Space\nThe CIE system characterizes colors by a luminance parameter Y and two color coordinates x and y which specify the point on the chromaticity diagram . This system offers more precision in color measurement than do the Munsell and Ostwald systems because the parameters are based on the spectral power distribution ( SPD ) of the light emitted from a colored object and are factored by sensitivity curves which have been measured for the human eye.\nBased on the fact that the human eye has three different types of color sensitive cones , the response of the eye is best described in terms of three \" tristimulus values \". However, once this is accomplished, it is found that any color can be expressed in terms of the two color coordinates x and y.\nThe colors which can be matched by combining a given set of three primary colors (such as the blue, green,a nd red of a color television screen) are represented on the chromaticity diagram by a triangle joining the coordinates for the three colors.",
                "Visible Light and the Eye's Response\nLight Waves and Color - Lesson 2 - Color and Vision\nVisible Light and the Eye's Response\nBlue Skies and Red Sunsets\nAs mentioned in the first section of Lesson 2 , our eyes are sensitive to a very narrow band of frequencies within the enormous range of frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum. This narrow band of frequencies is referred to as the visible light spectrum. Visible light - that which is detectable by the human eye - consists of wavelengths ranging from approximately 780 nanometer (7.80 x 10-7 m) down to 390 nanometer (3.90 x 10-7 m). Specific wavelengths within the spectrum correspond to a specific color based upon how humans typically perceive light of that wavelength. The long wavelength end of the spectrum corresponds to light that is perceived by humans to be red and the short wavelength end of the spectrum corresponds to light that is perceived to be violet. Other colors within the spectrum include orange, yellow, green and blue. The graphic below depicts the approximate range of wavelengths that are associated with the various perceived colors within the spectrum.\n \n \nColor Cones\nColor can be thought of as a psychological and physiological response to light waves of a specific frequency or set of frequencies impinging upon the eye. An understanding of the human response to color demands that one understand the biology of the eye. Light that enters the eye through the pupil ultimately strikes the inside surface of the eye known as the retina. The retina is lined with a variety of light sensing cells known as rods and cones. While the rods on the retina are sensitive to the intensity of light, they cannot distinguish between lights of different wavelengths. On the other hand, the cones are the color-sensing cells of the retina. When light of a given wavelength enters the eye and strikes the cones of the retina, a chemical reaction is activated that results in an electrical impulse being sent along nerves to the brain. It is believed that there are three kinds of cones, each sensitive to its own range of wavelengths within the visible light spectrum. These three kinds of cones are referred to as red cones, green cones, and blue cones because of their respective sensitivity to the wavelengths of light that are associated with red, green and blue. Since the red cone is sensitive to a range of wavelengths, it is not only activated by wavelengths of red light, but also (to a lesser extent) by wavelengths of orange light, yellow light and even green light. In the same manner, the green cone is most sensitive to wavelengths of light associated with the color green. Yet the green cone can also be activated by wavelengths of light associated with the colors yellow and blue. The graphic below is a sensitivity curve that depicts the range of wavelengths and the sensitivity level for the three kinds of cones.\nThe cone sensitivity curve shown above helps us to better understand our response to the light that is incident upon the retina. While the response is activated by the physics of light waves, the response itself is both physiological and psychological. Suppose that white light - i.e., light consisting of the full range of wavelengths within the visible light spectrum - is incident upon the retina. Upon striking the retina, the\nphysiological occurs: photochemical reactions occur within the cones to produce electrical impulses that are sent along nerves to the brain. The cones respond to the incident light by sending a message forward to brain, saying, \"Light is hitting me.\" Upon reaching the brain, the psychological occurs: the brain detects the electrical messages being sent by the cones and interprets the meaning of the messages. The brain responds by saying \"it is white.\" For the case of white light entering the eye and striking the retina, each of the three kinds of cones would be activated into sending the electrical messages along to the brain. And the brain recognizes that the messages are being sent by all three cones and somehow interprets this to mean that white light has entered the eye.\nNow suppose that light in the yellow range of wavelengths (approximately 577 nm to 597 nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light with these wavelengths would activate both the green and the red cones of the retina. Upon striking the retina, the physiological occurs: electrical messages are sent by both the red and the green cones to the brain. Once received by the brain, the psychological occurs: the brain recognizes that the light has activated both the red and the green cones and somehow interprets this to mean that the object is yellow. In this sense, the yellow appearance of objects is simply the result of yellow light from the object entering our eye and stimulating the red and the green cones simultaneously.\nIf the appearance of yellow is perceived of an object when it activates the red and the green cones simultaneously, then what appearance would result if two overlapping red and green spotlights entered our eye? Using the same three-cone theory, we could make some predictions of the result. Red light entering our eye would mostly activate the red color cone; and green light entering our eye would mostly activate the green color cone. Each cone would send their usual electrical messages to the brain. If the brain has been psychologically trained to interpret these two signals to mean \"yellow\", then the brain would perceive the overlapping red and green spotlights to appear as yellow. To the eye-brain system, there is no difference in the physiological and psychological response to yellow light and a mixing of red and green light. The brain has no means of distinguishing between the two physical situations.\n \nIn a technical sense, it is really not appropriate to refer to light as being colored. Light is simply a wave with a specific wavelength or a mixture of wavelengths; it has no color in and of itself. An object that is emitting or reflecting light to our eye appears to have a specific color as the result of the eye-brain response to the\nwavelength. So technically, there is really no such thing as yellow light. Rather, there is light with a wavelength of about 590 nm that appears yellow. And there is also light with a mixture of wavelengths of about 700 nm and 530 nm that together appears yellow. The yellow appearance of these two clearly different light sources can be traced to the physiological and psychological response of the eye-brain system, and not to the light itself. So to be technically appropriate, a person would refer to \"yellow light\" as \"light that creates a yellow appearance.\" Yet, to maintain a larger collection of friendships, a person would refer to \"yellow light\" as \"yellow light.\"\nIn the next several sections of Lesson 2, we will explore these concepts further by introducing three primary colors of light and generating some simple rules for predicting the color appearance of objects in terms of the three primary colors.\n \nInvestigate!\nIn this lesson we will spend a lot of time discussing three light colors - red, green, and blue. We will perceive light as consisting of red, green and blue qualities. Use the RGB widget below to determine the ratios by which red, green and blue light combine to form other light colors. Enter the name of a color (maize, purple, orange, sky blue, etc.) into the field. Then click the Submit button to find out its red, green, and blue components.",
                "Molecular Expressions Microscopy Primer: Physics of Light and Color - Human Vision and Color Perception\nMovie Gallery\nHuman Vision and Color Perception\nHuman stereo color vision is a very complex process that is not completely understood, despite hundreds of years of intense study and modeling.  Vision involves the nearly simultaneous interaction of the two eyes and the brain through a network of neurons, receptors, and other specialized cells.  The first steps in this sensory process are the stimulation of light receptors in the eyes, conversion of the light stimuli or images into signals, and transmission of electrical signals containing the vision information from each eye to the brain through the optic nerves.  This information is processed in several stages, ultimately reaching the visual cortices of the cerebrum.\nThe human eye is equipped with a variety of optical components including the cornea, iris, pupil, aqueous and vitreous humors, a variable-focus lens, and the retina (as illustrated in Figure 1).  Together, these elements work to form images of the objects that fall into the field of view for each eye.  When an object is observed, it is first focused through the convex cornea and lens elements, forming an inverted image on the surface of the retina, a multi-layered membrane that contains millions of light-sensitive cells.  In order to reach the retina, light rays focused by the cornea must successively traverse the aqueous humor (in the anterior chamber), the crystalline lens, the gelatinous vitreous body, and the vascular and neuronal layers of the retina before they reach the photosensitive outer segments of the cone and rod cells.  These photosensory cells detect the image and translate it into a series of electrical signals for transmission to the brain.\nDespite some misconceptions due to the wide spectrum of terminology employed for describing eye anatomy, it is the cornea, not the lens, which is responsible for the major part of the total refractive power of the eye.  Being smooth and clear as glass, yet as flexible and durable as plastic, the anterior, strongly curved, transparent part of the exterior wall of the eyeball allows the image-forming light rays to pass through to the interior.  The cornea also protects the eye by providing a physical barrier that shields the inside of the eye from microorganisms, dust, fibers, chemical, and other harmful materials.  Although much thinner in width than the crystalline lens, the cornea provides about 65 percent of the eye's refractive power.  Most of the power to bend light resides near the center of the cornea, which is rounder and thinner than the peripheral portions of the tissue.\nAs the window that controls the entry of light into the eye, the cornea (Figure 2) is essential to good vision and also acts as an ultraviolet light filter.  The cornea removes some of the most damaging ultraviolet wavelengths present in sunlight, thereby further protecting the highly susceptible retina and crystalline lens from damage.  If the cornea is curved too much, as in the case of nearsightedness, distant objects will appear as blurry images, because of imperfect light refraction to the retina.  In a condition known as astigmatism, imperfections or irregularities in the cornea result in unequal refraction, which creates distortion of images projected onto the retina.\nUnlike most tissues of the body, the cornea does not contain blood vessels for nourishment or to protect it against infection.  Even the smallest capillaries would interfere with the precise refraction process.  The cornea receives its nourishment from tears and the aqueous humor, which fills the chambers behind the structure.  The outer epithelial layer of the cornea is packed with thousands of small nerve endings, making the cornea extremely sensitive to pain when rubbed or scratched.  Comprising about 10 percent of the tissue's thickness, the epithelial layer of the cornea blocks foreign matter from entering the eye while providing a smooth surface for oxygen and nutrient absorption.  The central layer of the cornea, known as the stroma, comprises about 90 percent of the tissue, and consists of a water-saturated fibrous protein network that provides strength, elasticity, and form to support the epithelium.  Nourishing cells complete the remainder of the stroma layer.  Because the stroma tends to absorb water, the endothelium tissue's primary task is to pump excess water from the stroma.  Without this pumping action, the stroma would swell with water, become hazy, and ultimately turn the cornea opaque, rendering the eye blind.\nThe partial or complete loss of transparency by the crystalline lens, or its capsule, results in a common condition known as cataracts.  Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide and represent an important cause of visual impairment in the United States.  Development of cataracts in adults is related to normal aging, sunlight exposure, smoking, poor nutrition, eye trauma, systemic disease such as diabetes and glaucoma, and undesirable side effects from some pharmaceuticals, including steroids.  In the early stages, an individual suffering from cataracts perceives the world as blurry or out of focus.  Clear vision is prevented by a reduction in the amount of light that reaches the retina and by clouding of the image (through diffraction and light scattering) as though the individual were observing the environment through a fog or haze (see Figure 3).  Removal of the opaque lens during cataract surgery, with subsequent replacement by a plastic lens (intraocular lens implants), often results in corrected vision for unrelated conditions such as nearsightedness or farsightedness.\nThe function of the retina is similar to the combination of a digital image sensor (such as a charge-coupled device (CCD)) with an analog-to-digital converter, as featured in modern digital camera systems.  The image-capturing receptors of the eyes, known as rods and cones, are connected with the fibers of the optic nerve bundle through a series of specialized cells that coordinate the transmission of signals to the brain.  The amount of light allowed to enter each eye is controlled by the iris, a circular diaphragm that opens wide at low light levels and closes to protect the pupil (the aperture) and retina at very high levels of illumination.\nAs illumination changes, the diameter of the pupil (positioned in front of the crystalline lens) reflexively varies between a size of about 2 to 8 millimeters, modulating the amount of light that reaches the retina.  When illumination is very bright, the pupil narrows and peripheral portions of the refractile elements are excluded from the optical pathway.  The result is that fewer aberrations are encountered by image-forming light rays, and the image on the retina becomes sharper.  A very narrow pupil (approximately 2 millimeters) produces diffraction artifacts that spread the image of a point source on the retina.\nIn the brain, the neural fibers of the optic nerves from each eye cross at the optic chiasma where visual information from both retinas traveling in parallel pathways is correlated, somewhat like the function of a time base correction generator in a digital video tape recorder.  From there, the visual information travels through the optic tract to the knee-shaped lateral geniculate nuclei in the thalamus, where the signals are distributed via the optic radiations to the two visual cortices located on the lower rear section of each half of the cerebrum.  In the lower layers of the cortex, the information from each eye is maintained as columnar ocular dominance stripes.  As the visual signals are transmitted to the upper layers of the cortex, information from the two eyes is merged and binocular vision is formed.  In abnormal ophthalmic conditions such as phorias (misalignments) of the eyes, including strabismus (better known as crossed-eyes), stereovision is disrupted as are the individual's bearings and depth perception.  In cases where ophthalmic surgery is not warranted, prismatic lenses mounted in spectacles can correct some of these anomalies.  Causes of interruption to the binocular fusion may be head or birth trauma, neuromuscular disease, or congenital defects.\nThe central fovea is located in an area near the center of the retina, and positioned directly along the optical axis of each eye.  Known also as the \"yellow spot\", the fovea is small (less than 1 square millimeter), but very specialized.  These areas contain exclusively high-density, tightly packed cone cells (greater than 200,000 cones per square millimeter in adult humans; see Figure 4).  The central fovea is the area of sharpest vision, and produces the maximum resolution of space (spatial resolution), contrast, and color.  Each eye is populated with approximately seven million cone cells, which are very thin (3 micrometers in diameter) and elongated.  The density of cone cells decreases outside of the fovea as the ratio of rod cells to cone cells gradually increases (Figure 4).  At the periphery of the retina, the total number of both types of light receptors decreases substantially, causing a dramatic loss of visual sensitivity at the retinal borders.  This is offset by the fact that humans constantly scan objects in the field of view (due to involuntary rapid eye movements), resulting in a perceived image that is uniformly sharp.  In fact, when the image is prevented from moving relative to the retina (via an optical fixation device), the eye no longer senses an image after a few seconds.\nThe arrangement of sensory receptors in the outer segments of the retina partially determine the limit of resolution in different regions of the eye.  In order to resolve an image, a row of less-stimulated photoreceptors must be interposed between two rows of photoreceptors that are highly stimulated.  Otherwise, it is impossible to distinguish whether the stimulation originated from two closely spaced images or from a single image that spans the two receptor rows.  With a center-to-center spacing ranging between 1.5 and 2 micrometers for the cones in the central fovea, optical stimuli having a separation of approximately 3 to 4 micrometers should produce a resolvable set of intensities on the retina.  For reference, the radius of the first minimum for a diffraction pattern formed on the retina is about 4.6 micrometers with 550-nanometer light and a pupil diameter of 2 millimeters.  Thus, the arrangement of sensory elements in the retina will determine the limiting resolution of the eye.  Another factor, termed visual acuity (the ability of the eye to detect small objects and resolve their separation), varies with many parameters, including the definition of the term and the method by which acuity is measured.  Over the retina, visual acuity is generally highest in the central fovea, which spans a visual field of about 1.4 degrees.\nThe spatial arrangement of rod and cone cells and their connection to neurons within the retina is presented in Figure 5.  Rod cells, containing only the photopigment rhodopsin, have a peak sensitivity to blue-green light (wavelength of about 500 nanometers), although they display a broad range of response throughout the visible spectrum.  They are the most common visual receptor cells, with each eye containing about 125-130 million rod cells.  The light sensitivity of rod cells is about 1,000 times that of cone cells.  However, the images generated by rod stimulation alone are relatively unsharp and confined to shades of gray, similar to those found in a black and white soft-focus photographic image.  Rod vision is commonly referred to as scotopic or twilight vision because in low light conditions, shapes and the relative brightness of objects can be distinguished, but not their colors.  This mechanism of dark adaptation enables the detection of potential prey and predators via shape and motion in a wide spectrum of vertebrates.\nThe human visual system response is logarithmic, not linear, resulting in the ability to perceive an incredible brightness range (interscene dynamic range) of over 10 decades.  In broad daylight, humans can visualize objects in the glaring light from the sun, while at night large objects can be detected by starlight when the moon is dark.  At threshold sensitivity, the human eye can detect the presence of about 100-150 photons of blue-green light (500 nanometers) entering the pupil.  For the upper seven decades of brightness, photopic vision predominates, and it is the retinal cones that are primarily responsible for photoreception.  In contrast, the lower four decades of brightness, termed scotopic vision, are controlled by the rod cells.\nAdaptation of the eye enables vision to function under such extremes of brightness.  However, during the interval of time before adaptation occurs, individuals can sense a range of brightness covering only about three decades.  Several mechanisms are responsible for the ability of the eye to adapt to a high range of brightness levels.  Adaptation can occur in seconds (by initial pupillary reaction) or may take several minutes (for dark adaptation), depending upon the level of brightness change.  Full cone sensitivity is reached in about 5 minutes, whereas it requires about 30 minutes to adapt from moderate photopic sensitivity to the full scoptic sensitivity produced by the rod cells.\nWhen fully light-adapted, the human eye features a wavelength response from around 400 to 700 nanometers, with a peak sensitivity at 555 nanometers (in the green region of the visible light spectrum).  The dark-adapted eye responds to a lower range of wavelengths between 380 and 650 nanometers, with the peak occurring at 507 nanometers.  For both photopic and scoptic vision, these wavelengths are not absolute, but vary with the intensity of light.  The transmission of light through the eye becomes progressively lower at shorter wavelengths.  In the blue-green region (500 nanometers), only about 50 percent of light entering the eye reaches the image point on the retina.  At 400 nanometers, this value is reduced to a scant 10 percent, even in a young eye.  Light scattering and absorption by elements in the crystalline lens contributes to a further loss of sensitivity in the far blue.\nCones consist of three cell types, each \"tuned\" to a distinct wavelength response maximum centered at either 430, 535, or 590 nanometers.  The basis for the individual maxima is the utilization of three different photopigments, each with a characteristic visible light absorption spectrum.  The photopigments alter their conformation when a photon is detected, enabling them to react with transducin to initiate a cascade of visual events.  Transducin is a protein that resides in the retina and is able to effectively convert light energy into an electrical signal.  The population of cone cells is much smaller than rod cells, with each eye containing between 5 and 7 million of these color receptors.  True color vision is induced by the stimulation of cone cells.  The relative intensity and wavelength distribution of light impacting on each of the three cone receptor types determines the color that is imaged (as a mosaic), in a manner comparable to an additive RGB video monitor or CCD color camera.\nA beam of light that contains mostly short-wavelength blue radiation stimulates the cone cells that respond to 430-nanometer light to a far greater extent than the other two cone types.  This beam will activate the blue color pigment in specific cones, and that light is perceived as blue.  Light with a majority of wavelengths centered around 550 nanometers is seen as green, and a beam containing mostly 600 nanometer wavelengths or longer is visualized as red.  As mentioned above, pure cone vision is referred to as photopic vision and is dominant at normal light levels, both indoors and out.  Most mammals are dichromats, usually able to only distinguish between bluish and greenish color components.  In contrast, some primates (most notably humans) exhibit trichromatic color vision, with significant response to red, green and blue light stimuli.\nIllustrated in Figure 6 are the absorption spectra of the four human visual pigments, which display maxima in the expected red, green, and blue regions of the visible light spectrum.  When all three types of cone cell are stimulated equally, the light is perceived as being achromatic or white.  For example, noon sunlight appears as white light to humans, because it contains approximately equal amounts of red, green, and blue light.  An excellent demonstration of the color spectrum from sunlight is the interception of the light by a glass prism, which refracts (or bends) different wavelengths to varying degrees, spreading out the light into its component colors.  Human color perception is dependent upon the interaction of all receptor cells with light, and this combination results in nearly trichromic stimulation.  There are shifts in color sensitivity with variations in light levels, so that blue colors look relatively brighter in dim light and red colors look brighter in bright light.  This effect can be observed by pointing a flashlight onto a color print, which will result in the reds suddenly appearing much brighter and more saturated.\nIn recent years, consideration of human color visual sensitivity has led to changes in the long-standing practice of painting emergency vehicles, such as fire trucks and ambulances, entirely red.  Although the color is intended for the vehicles to be easily seen and responded to, the wavelength distribution is not highly visible at low light levels and appears nearly black at night.  The human eye is much more sensitive to yellow-green or similar hues, particularly at night, and now most new emergency vehicles are at least partially painted a vivid yellowish green or white, often retaining some red highlights in the interest of tradition.\nWhen only one or two types of cone cells are stimulated, the range of perceived colors is limited.  For example, if a narrow band of green light (540 to 550 nanometers) is used to stimulate all of the cone cells, only the ones containing green photoreceptors will respond to produce a sensation of seeing the color green.  Human visual perception of primary subtractive colors, such as yellow, can arise in one of two ways.  If the red and green cone cells are simultaneously stimulated with monochromatic yellow light having a wavelength of 580 nanometers, the cone cell receptors each respond almost equally because their absorption spectral overlap is approximately the same in this region of the visible light spectrum.  The same color sensation can be achieved by stimulating the red and green cone cells individually with a mixture of distinct red and green wavelengths selected from regions of the receptor absorption spectra that do not have significant overlap.  The result, in both cases, is simultaneous stimulation of red and green cone cells to produce a sensation of yellow color, even though the end result is achieved by two different mechanisms.  The ability to perceive other colors requires the stimulation of one, two, or all three types of cone cells, to various degrees, with the appropriate wavelength palette.\nAlthough the human visual system features three types of cones cells with their respective color pigments plus light-receptive rod cells for scotopic vision, it is the human brain that compensates for variations of light wavelengths and light sources in its perception of color. Metamers are pairs of different light spectra perceived as the same color by the human brain.  Interestingly, colors that are interpreted as the same or similar by a human are sometimes readily distinguishable by other animals, most notably birds.\nIntermediary neurons that ferry visual information between the retina and the brain are not simply connected one-to-one with the sensory cells.  Each cone and rod cell in the fovea sends signals to at least three bipolar cells, whereas in the more peripheral regions of the retina, signals from large numbers of rod cells converge to a single ganglion cell.  Spatial resolution in the outer portions of the retina is compromised by having a large number of rod cells feeding a single channel, but having many sensory cells participate in capturing weak signals significantly improves the threshold sensitivity of the eye.  This feature of the human eye is somewhat analogous to the consequence of binning in slow-scan CCD digital camera systems.\nThe sensory, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells of the retina are also interconnected to other neurons, providing a complex network of inhibitory and excitatory pathways.  As a result, the signals from the 5 to 7 million cones and 125 million rods in the human retina are processed and transported to the visual cortex by only about 1 million myelinated optical nerve fibers.  The eye muscles are stimulated and controlled by ganglion cells in the lateral geniculate body, which acts as a feedback control between the retina and the visual cortex.\nThe complex network of excitatory and inhibitory pathways in the retina are arranged in three layers of neuronal cells that arise from a specific region of the brain during embryonic development.  These circuits and feedback loops result in a combination of effects that produce edge sharpening, contrast enhancement, spatial summation, noise averaging, and other forms of signal processing, perhaps including some that have not yet been discovered.  In human vision, a significant degree of image processing takes place in the brain, but the retina itself also is involved in a wide range of processing tasks.\nIn another aspect of human vision known as color invariance, the color or gray value of an object does not appear to change over a wide range of luminance.  In 1672, Sir Isaac Newton demonstrated color invariance in human visual sensation and provided clues for the classical theory of color perception and the nervous system.  Edwin H. Land, founder of the Polaroid Corporation, proposed the Retinex theory of color vision, based on his observations of color invariance.  As long as color (or a gray value) is viewed under adequate lighting, a color patch does not change its color even when the luminance of the scene is changed.  In this case, a gradient of illumination across the scene does not alter the perceived color or gray-level tone of a patch.  If the luminance level reaches the threshold for scotopic or twilight vision, the sensation of color vanishes.  In Land's algorithm, the lightness values of colored areas are computed, and the energy at a particular area in the scene is compared with all the other areas in the scene for that waveband.  The calculations are performed three times, one for each waveband (long wave, short wave, and middle wave), and the resulting triplet of lightness values determines a position for the area in the three-dimensional color space defined by the Retinex theory.\nThe term color blindness is something of a misnomer, being widely used in colloquial conversation to refer to any difficulty in distinguishing between colors.  True color blindness, or the inability to see any color, is extremely rare, although as many as 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women are born with some form of color vision defect (see Table 1).  Inherited deficiencies in color vision are usually the result of defects in the photoreceptor cells in the retina, a neuro-membrane that functions as the imaging surface at the rear of the eye.  Color vision defects can also be acquired, as a result of disease, side effects of certain medications, or through normal aging processes, and these deficiencies may affect parts of the eye other than the photoreceptors.\nNormal cones and pigment sensitivity enable an individual to distinguish all the different colors as well as subtle mixtures of hues.  This type of normal color vision is known as trichromacy and relies upon the mutual interaction from the overlapping sensitivity ranges of all three types of photoreceptor cone.  A mild color vision deficiency occurs when the pigment in one of the three cone types has a defect, and its peak sensitivity is shifted to another wavelength, producing a visual deficiency termed anomalous trichromacy, one of three broad categories of color vision defect. Dichromacy, a more severe form of color blindness, or color deficiency, occurs when one of the pigments is seriously deviant in its absorption characteristics, or the particular pigment has not been produced at all.  The complete absence of color sensation, or monochromacy, is extremely rare, but individuals with total color blindness (rod monochromats) see only varying degrees of brightness, and the world appears in black, white, and shades of gray.  This condition occurs only in individuals who inherit a gene for the disorder from both parents.\nDichromats can distinguish some colors, and are therefore less affected in their daily lives than monochromats, but they are usually aware that they have a problem with their color vision.  Dichromacy is subdivided into three types: protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia (see Figure 7).  Approximately two percent of the male population inherits one of the first two types, with the third occurring much more rarely.\nInteractive Java Tutorial\nIshihara Color Blindness Test\nColor blindness, a disruption in the normal functioning of human photopic vision, can be caused by host of conditions, including those derived from genetics, biochemistry, physical damage, and diseases.  This interactive tutorial explores and simulates how full-color images appear to colorblind individuals, and compares these images to the Ishihara diagnostic colorblind test.\n \nProtanopia is a red-green defect, resulting from loss of red sensitivity, which causes a lack of perceptible difference between red, orange, yellow, and green.  In addition, the brightness of red, orange, and yellow colors is dramatically reduced in comparison to normal levels.  The reduced intensity effect can result in red traffic lights appearing dark (unlit), and red hues (in general), appearing as black or dark gray.  Protanopes often learn to correctly distinguish between red and green, and red from yellow, primarily based on their apparent brightness, rather than on any perceptible hue difference.  Green generally appears lighter than red to these individuals.  Because red light occurs at one end of the visible spectrum, there is little overlap in sensitivity with the other two cone types, and people with protanopia have a pronounced loss of sensitivity to light at the long-wavelength (red) end of the spectrum.  Individuals with this color vision defect can discriminate between blues and yellows, but lavender, violet, and purple cannot be distinguished from various shades of blue, due to the attenuation of the red component in these hues.\nIndividuals with deuteranopia, which is a loss of green sensitivity, have many of the same problems with hue discrimination as do protanopes, but have a fairly normal level of sensitivity across the visible spectrum.  Because of the location of green light in the center of the visible light spectrum, and the overlapping sensitivity curves of the cone receptors, there is some response of the red and blue photoreceptors to green wavelengths.  Although deuteranopia is associated with at least a brightness response to green light (and little abnormal intensity reduction), the names red, orange, yellow, and green seem to the deuteranope to be too many terms for colors that appear the same.  In a similar fashion, blues, violets, purples, and lavenders are not distinguishable to individuals with this color vision defect.\nColor Blindness Incidence and Causes\nClassification\n< 0.0001\nTable 1\nTritanopia is the absence of blue sensitivity, and functionally produces a blue-yellow defect in color vision.  Individuals with this deficiency cannot distinguish blues and yellows, but do register a difference between red and green.  The condition is quite rare, and occurs about equally in both sexes.  Tritanopes usually do not have as much difficulty in performing everyday tasks as do individuals with either of the red-green variants of dichromacy.  Because blue wavelengths occur only at one end of the spectrum, and there is little overlap in sensitivity with the other two cone types, total loss of sensitivity across the spectrum can be quite severe with this condition.\nWhen there is a loss of sensitivity by a cone receptor, but the cones are still functional, resulting color vision deficiencies are considered anomalous trichromacy, and they are categorized in a similar manner to the dichromacy types.  Confusion often arises because these conditions are named similarly, but appended with a suffix derived from the term anomaly.  Thus, protanomaly, and deuteranomaly produce hue recognition problems that are similar to the red-green dichromacy defects, though not as pronounced.  Protanomaly is considered a \"red weakness\" of color vision, with red (or any color having a red component) being visualized as lighter than normal, and hues shifted toward green.  A deuteranomalous individual exhibits \"green weakness\", and has similar difficulties in discriminating between small variations in hues falling in the red, orange, yellow, and green region of the visible spectrum.  This occurs because the hues appear to be shifted toward red.  In contrast, deuteranomalous individuals do not have the brightness loss defect that accompanies protanomaly.  Many people with these anomalous trichromacy variants have little difficulty performing tasks that require normal color vision, and some may not even be aware that their color vision is impaired. Tritanomaly, or blue weakness, has not been reported as an inherited defect.  In the few cases in which the deficiency has been identified, it is thought to have been acquired rather than inherited.  Several eye diseases (such as glaucoma, which attacks the blue cones) can result in tritanomaly.  Peripheral blue cone loss is most common in these diseases.\nIn spite of the limitations, there are some visual acuity advantages to color blindness, such as the increased ability to discriminate camouflaged objects.  Outlines, rather than colors, are responsible for pattern recognition, and improvements in night vision may occur due to certain color vision deficiencies.  In the military, colorblind snipers and spotters are highly valued for these reasons.  During the early 1900s, in an effort to evaluate abnormal human color vision, the Nagel anomaloscope was developed.  Utilizing this instrument, the observer manipulates control knobs to match two colored fields for color and brightness.  Another evaluation method, the Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plate test for color blindness, named for Dr. Shinobu Ishihara, discriminates between normal color vision and red-green color blindness (as presented in the tutorial and Figure 7).  A test subject with normal color vision can detect the hue difference between the figure and background.  To an observer with red-green deficiency, the plates appear isochromatic with no discrimination between the figures and the design pattern.\nAs a natural part of the aging process, the human eye begins to perceive colors differently in later years, but does not become \"colorblind\" in the true sense of the term.  Aging results in the yellowing and darkening of the crystalline lens and cornea, degenerative effects that are also accompanied by a shrinking of the pupil size.  With yellowing, shorter wavelengths of visible light are absorbed, so blue hues appear darker.  As a consequence, elderly individuals often experience difficulty discriminating between colors that differ primarily in their blue content, such as blue and gray or red and purple.  At age 60, when compared to the visual efficiency of a 20-year old, only 33 percent of the light incident on the cornea reaches the photoreceptors in the retina.  This value drops to around 12.5 percent by the mid-70s.\nInteractive Java Tutorial\nHuman Eye Accommodation\nAccommodation of the eye refers to the physiological act of adjusting crystalline lens elements to alter the refractive power and bring objects that are closer to the eye into sharp focus.  This tutorial explores changes in the lens structure as objects are relocated with respect to the eye.\n \nAccommodation of the eye refers to the act of physiologically adjusting the crystalline lens element to alter the refractive power and bring objects that are closer to the eye into sharp focus.  Light rays initially refracted at the surface of the cornea are further converged after passing through the lens.  During accommodation, contraction of the ciliary muscles relaxes tension on the lens, resulting in changes to the shape of the transparent and elastic tissue, while also moving it slightly forward.  The net effect of the lens alterations is to adjust the focal length of the eye to bring the image exactly into focus onto the photosensitive layer of cells residing in the retina.  Accommodation also relaxes the tension applied to the lens by the zonule fibers, and allows the anterior surface of the lens to increase its curvature.  The increased degree of refraction, coupled with a slight forward shift in the position of the lens, brings objects that are closer to the eye into focus.\nFocus in the eye is controlled by a combination of elements including the iris, lens, cornea, and muscle tissue, which can alter the shape of the lens so the eye can focus on both nearby and distant objects.  However, in some instances these muscles do not work properly or the eye is slightly altered in shape, and the focal point does not intersect with the retina (a condition termed convergent vision).  As individuals age, the lens becomes harder and cannot be properly focused, leading to poor vision.  If the point of focus falls short of the retina, the condition is referred to as nearsightedness or myopia, and individuals with this affliction cannot focus on distant objects.  In cases where the focal point is behind the retina, the eye will have trouble focusing on nearby objects, creating a condition known as farsightedness or hypermetropia.  These malfunctions of the eye can usually be corrected with eyeglasses (Figure 8) using a concave lens to treat myopia and a convex lens to treat hypermetropia.\nConvergent vision is not totally physiological and can be influenced by training, if the eyes are not defective.  Repetitive procedures can be utilized to develop strong convergent vision.  Athletes, such as baseball shortstops, have well-developed convergent vision.  In every movement, the two eyes have to translate in unison to preserve binocular vision, with an accurate and responsive neuromuscular apparatus that is not usually subject to fatigue, controlling their motility and coordination.  Changes in ocular convergence or head motion are considered in the calculations made by the complex ocular system to produce the proper neural inputs to the eye muscles.  An eye movement of 10 degrees may be completed in about 40 milliseconds, with the calculations occurring faster than the eye can reach its intended target.  Small eye movements are known as saccades and the larger movements from one point to another are termed versions.\nThe human visual system must not only detect light and color, but as an optical system, must be able to discern differences among objects, or an object and its background.  Known as physiological contrast or contrast discrimination, the relationship between the apparent brightness of two objects that are seen either at the same time (simultaneous contrast) or sequentially (successive contrast) against a background, may or may not be the same.  In the human visual system, contrast is reduced in environmental darkness and with individuals suffering from color visual deficiencies such as red-green color blindness.  Contrast is dependent on binocular vision, visual acuity, and image processing by the visual cortex of the brain.  An object with low contrast, which cannot be distinguished from the background unless it is moving, is considered camouflaged.  However, colorblind individuals are often able to detect camouflaged objects because of increased rod vision and loss of misleading color cues.  Increasing contrast translates into increased visibility, and a quantitative numerical value for contrast is usually expressed as a percentage or ratio.  Under optimal conditions, the human eye can barely detect the presence of two percent contrast.\nWith human vision, an apparent increase in contrast is perceived in a narrow zone on each side of the boundary between two areas of different brightness and/or chromaticity.  At the end of the nineteenth century, French physicist Michel Eug�ne Chevreul discovered simultaneous contrast.  As a special function of human visual perception, the edges or contour of an object are highlighted, setting the object away from its background and easing spatial orientation.  When positioned over a bright background, the region at the edge of a dark object appears lighter than the rest of the background (in effect, the contrast is enhanced).  With this perception phenomenon, the color with the strongest contrast, the complementary color, is created (by the brain) at the edge.  Because the color and its complement are perceived simultaneously, the effect is known as simultaneous contrast.  Borders and other lines of demarcation that separate the contrasting areas tend to lessen the effect (or optical illusion) by eliminating marginal contrast.  Many forms of optical microscopy, most notably phase contrast illumination, take advantage of these features of the human visual system.  By increasing the physical contrast of an image without having to change the object via staining or other technique, the phase contrast specimen is protected from damage or death (in the case of living specimens).\nThe spatial frequency response of the human eye can be evaluated by determining the ability to detect a series of strips in a modulated sinusoidal grating.  Test gratings feature alternating regions (strips) of light and dark, which increases linearly from higher to lower frequencies along the horizontal axis while contrast decreases logarithmically from top to bottom.  The boundary of stripes that can just be distinguished by individuals with normal vision is between 7 and 10 cycles per degree.  For achromatic vision, when the spatial frequency is very low (broad line spacing), high contrast is required to detect the sinusoidally varying intensity.  As the spatial frequency rises, humans can detect periods with less contrast, reaching a peak of about 8 cycles per degree in the visual field.  Beyond that point, higher contrast is again required to detect the finer sinusoidal stripes.\nExamination of the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the human visual system reveals that the contrast necessary to detect the luminance variation in standardized sinusoidal gratings increases at both higher and lower spatial frequencies.  In this regard, the eye behaves quite differently from a simple imaging device (such as a film camera or CCD sensor).  The modulation transfer function of a simple, focused camera system displays a maximum modulation at zero spatial frequency, with the degree of modulation dropping more or less monotonically to zero at the camera's cutoff frequency.\nWhen the luminance of a scene fluctuates periodically several times a second (as it does with television and computer monitor screens), humans perceive an irritating sensation, as though the sequential scenes were disjoined.  When the fluctuation frequency increases, irritation increases and reaches a maximum at around 10 hertz, especially when bright flashes of illumination alternate with darkness.  At higher frequencies, the scene no longer appears disjointed, and objects displaced from one scene to the next are now perceived to be moving smoothly.  Commonly referred to as flicker, the annoying light fluttering sensation can persist up to 50-60 hertz.  Beyond a certain frequency and luminance, known as the critical flicker frequency (CFF), screen flicker is no longer perceived.  This is the primary reason why increasing the refresh rate of a computer monitor from 60 to 85-100 hertz produces a stable, flicker-free display.\nAdvances in semiconductor fabrication technology, especially complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS) and bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) techniques, has led to a new generation of miniature photosensors that feature extraordinary dynamic range and fast response.  Recently, arrays of CMOS sensor chips have been arranged to model the operation of the human retina.  These so-called eye chips, by combining optics, human vision, and microprocessors, are advancing ophthalmology through the new field of optobionics.  Damaged retinas resulting from debilitating visual diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration, as well as aging and injuries to the retina, which rob vision, are being corrected with the implanted eye chips.  The silicon eye chips contain approximately 3,500 miniature light detectors attached to metal electrodes that mimic the function of the human rods and cones.  The light detectors absorb incident light refracted by the cornea and lens and produce a small quantity of electrical charge that stimulates the retinal neurons.  Featuring a diameter of two millimeters (see Figure 9), the replacement retina is half as thick as a typical piece of paper and is implanted into a pocket under the damaged retina.\nAs an alternative to the eye chip, a retinal prosthesis using a digital signal processor and a camera mounted on a pair of glasses, captures and transmits an image of an object or scene.  Wirelessly, the image is sent to an embedded receiver chip near the retinal layers where nerve impulses are sent to the brain.  Artificial retinas, however, will not treat glaucoma or vision deficiencies that damage the nerve fibers leading to the optic nerve.  As optobionics advances, so does science's understanding of the complex human visual system.\nContributing Authors\nKenneth R. Spring - Scientific Consultant, Lusby, Maryland, 20657.\nThomas J.

                "Molecular Expressions: Science, Optics, and You: Light and Color - Human Vision and Color\nHome\nHuman Vision and Color Perception\nHuman vision is a complex process that is not yet completely understood, despite hundreds of years of study and research.  The complex physical process of visualizing something involves the nearly simultaneous interaction of the eyes and the brain through a network of neurons, receptors, and other specialized cells.\nThe human eye is equipped with a variety of optical elements including the cornea, iris, pupil, a variable-focus lens, and the retina, as illustrated above in Figure 1.  Together, these elements work to form images of the objects in a person's field of view.  When an object is observed, it is first focused through the cornea and lens onto the retina, a multilayered membrane that contains millions of light-sensitive cells that detect the image and translate it into a series of electrical signals.  These image capturing receptors of the retina are termed rods and cones, and are connected with the fibers of the optic nerve bundle through a series of specialized cells that coordinate the transmission of the electrical signals to the brain.  In the brain, the optic nerves from both eyes join at the optic chiasma where information from their retinas is correlated.  The visual information is then processed through several steps, eventually arriving at the visual cortex, which is located on the lower rear section of each half of the cerebrum.\nInteractive Tutorial\nHuman Vision\nExplore how images are produced on the retina of the human eye as an object is moved closer or farther away.  \nA particularly specialized component of the eye is the fovea centralis, which is located on the optical axis of the eye in an area near the center of the retina.  This area exclusively contains high-density tightly packed cone cells and is the area of sharpest vision.  The density level of cone cells decreases outside of the fovea centralis and the ratio of rod cells to cone cells gradually increases.  At the periphery of the retina, the total number of both types of light receptors decreases substantially, causing a dramatic loss of visual sensitivity at the retinal borders.  This is offset, however, by the fact that humans constantly scan objects in their field of view, usually resulting in a perceived image that is uniformly sharp.  A graphical illustration of the spatial arrangement of rod and cone cells and their connection to neurons within the retina can be seen below in Figure 2.\nRod cells are most sensitive to green wavelengths of light (about 550-555 nanometers), although they display a broad range of response throughout the visible spectrum.  They are the most populous visual receptor cells in humans, each eye containing about 130 million rods.  Extremely responsive, the light sensitivity of rod cells is about 1000 times that of cone cells.  However, the images generated by rod stimulation alone are relatively unsharp and confined to shades of gray, similar to those found in a black and white soft-focus photographic image.  Rod vision is commonly referred to as scotopic or twilight vision because in low light levels it enables individuals to distinguish shapes and the relative brightness of objects, but not their colors.\nCones, on the other hand, consist of three different types of cells, each \"tuned\" to a distinct wavelength peak of response centered at either 430, 535, or 590 nanometers.  Often referred to as photopic vision, cone vision is dominant at normal light levels, both indoors and out.  The quantity of cone cells possessed by humans, however, is much smaller than the number of rod cells, each eye only containing about 7 million cones.  Stimulation of these visual receptors results in what is known as true color vision.\nThe relative intensity of the stimulation incurred by each of the three types of cone receptors is what largely determines which color is imaged.  For example, a beam of light that contains mostly blue short-wavelength radiation stimulates the cone cells that respond to 430-nanometer light far more than the other two cone types and, therefore, that light is seen as blue.  Correspondingly, light with a majority of wavelengths centered around 550 nanometers appears green, and a beam containing mostly 600 nanometer wavelengths or longer is seen as red.  When all three types of cone cells are stimulated equally, light is perceived as being achromatic or white.  For instance, noon sunlight appears to humans as white light because it contains approximately equal amounts of red, green, and blue light, uniformly stimulating all types of cone receptors.\nNormal cones and pigment sensitivity enable humans to distinguish all of the different colors as well as subtle mixtures of hues.  This type of color vision is known as trichromacy and relies upon the mutual interaction of all three types of photoreceptor cones.  Yet, human color perception is also dependent upon illumination levels, shifts in color sensitivity occurring whenever lighting is varied.  For example, blue colors look relatively brighter in dim light, while red colors appear more vivid in bright light.  This effect can be simply observed by pointing a flashlight onto a color print, which results in the reds suddenly appearing much brighter and more saturated.\nFocus in the eye is controlled by a combination of elements, including the iris, lens, cornea, and muscle tissue.  Properly functioning together, these components can alter the shape of the lens so that the eye can focus on both nearby and distant objects.  However, in some instances the components do not work correctly or the eye is slightly altered in shape and the focal point does not intersect with the retina.  As people age, for instance, the lenses of their eyes become harder and cannot be focused properly, which results in poor vision.  If the point of an eye's focus is short of the retina, as illustrated in the lower part of Figure 3, the condition is called nearsightedness or myopia.  People with this affliction are unable to focus on distant objects.  In cases where the eye's focal point is behind the retina, as illustrated in the upper part of Figure 3, people have trouble focusing on nearby objects, which is a condition called hypermetropia, commonly known as farsightedness.  These malfunctions of the eye can usually be corrected through the use of glasses, with concave lenses correcting myopia and convex lenses rectifying hypermetropia.\nContributing Authors\nMortimer Abramowitz - Olympus America, Inc., Two Corporate Center Drive., Melville, New York, 11747.\nShannon H.

                "The Color-Sensitive Cones\nThe Color-Sensitive Cones\nIn 1965 came experimental confirmation of a long expected result -      there are three types of         color-sensitive cones           in the retina of the              human eye,                 corresponding                     roughly to red,                       green, and blue                        sensitive                              detectors.\nPainstaking experiments have yielded response curves for three different kind of cones in the retina of the human eye. The \"green\" and \"red\" cones are mostly packed into the fovea centralis . By population, about 64% of the cones are red-sensitive, about 32% green sensitive, and about 2% are blue sensitive. The \"blue\" cones have the highest sensitivity and are mostly found outside the fovea. The shapes of the curves are obtained by measurement of the absorption by the cones, but the relative heights for the three types are set equal for lack of detailed data. There are fewer blue cones, but the blue sensitivity is comparable to the others, so there must be some boosting mechanism. In the final visual perception, the three types seem to be comparable, but the detailed process of achieving this is not known.\nWhen light strikes a cone, it interacts with a visual pigment which consists of a protein called opsin and a small molecule called a chromophore which in humans is a derivative of vitamin A. Three different kinds of opsins respond to short, medium and long wavelengths of light and lead to the three response curves shown above. For a person to see an object in color, at least two kinds of cones must be triggered, and the perceived color is based on the relative level of excitation of the different cones.\nA fourth pigment, rhodopsin, is employed in rod vision .",
                "Sensitivity of the human eye\nSensitivity of the human eye\nThis page summarizes the basic characteristics of sensitivity of the human  eye.  This is useful when converting light intensities from luminous units like  Lumens (lm) that take into account eye perception into radiometric units like  Watts (W) that only take into account physical aspects.\nA light source radiating 1 W of green light will appear much brighter  than another source radiating the same amount of power of red light because  the eye is more sensitive in the green region. The human eye is sensible to light wave which wavelength is roughly between  400 nm (violet) and 700 nm (red).  Wavelengths shorter than 400 nm (ultraviolet, UV) or longer than  700 nm (infrared, IR) are not visible.\nThe eye behaves differently in high or low light conditions: in daylight, for  brightness levels above 3 cd/m2 the vision is mainly done by  the centre of the retina, we can see colors and the maximum sensitivity is  at 555 nm (in the green region).  This type of vision is called photopic vision.\nIn low light conditions, for brightness levels below  30 μcd/m2, the vision is mainly done by the peripheral  region of the retina which is color-blind, while the centre region is not  sensitive enough to see any color.  This type of vision is called scotopic vision.  Maximum sensitivity is at 507 nm (in the blue-green region) and red  light is almost invisible.\nThe vision in-between photopic and scotopic vision is called mesopic.\nThe nice thing about scotopic vision and its reduced sensitivity to red light  is that you can use a red flashlight to illuminate an object (to read a map,  for example) without disturbing your nigh vision.  It takes several minutes to get your vision used to the darkness; if you used  a white flashlight instead, the eyes will switch back to photopic vision and  you'll have to wait a few minutes again.  Red light can directly be picked up by the centre of the retina without  affecting night vision.  For this reason, astronomers often use red flashlights.\nThe standard eye response is visible in the two figures below in both linear  and logarithmic scale.\nThis standard eye sensitivity is also called standard luminosity  function V(λ) and is used, for photopic vision, to define a  conversion between the radiated energy (in Watts) and the luminous flux (in  Lumen).  The standard luminosity function V'(λ) refers to scotopic vision, but  it shouldn't be used to convert to and from photometric units.  A tabulated form of the two standard luminosity functions V(λ) and  V'(λ) are represented hereafter:\nWavelength"

                "A soap opera, soap, or soapie, is a serial drama on television or radio which examines the lives of many characters, usually focusing on emotional relationships to the point of melodrama.  The term soap opera originated from such dramas being typically sponsored by soap manufacturers in the past.\n\nOrigin of the genre\n\nThe first serial considered to be a \"soap opera\" was Painted Dreams, which debuted on October 20, 1930 on Chicago radio station WGN. Early radio series such as Painted Dreams were broadcast in weekday daytime slots, usually five days a week, when most of the listeners would be housewives; thus, the shows were aimed at and consumed by a predominantly female audience.Bowles, p. 118. In the name, \"soap\" refers to the soap and detergent commercials originally broadcast during the shows, which were aimed at women who were cleaning their houses at the time of listening or viewing, and \"opera\" refers to the melodramatic character of the shows.\n\nThe first nationally broadcast radio soap opera was Clara, Lu, and Em, which aired on the NBC Blue Network at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time on January 27, 1931.\n\nStory and episode structure\n\nA crucial element that defines the soap opera is the open-ended serial nature of the narrative, with stories spanning several episodes. One of the defining features that makes a television program a soap opera, according to Albert Moran, is \"that form of television that works with a continuous open narrative. Each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode\".Bowles, p. 121. In 2012, Los Angeles Times columnist Robert Lloyd wrote of daily dramas, \"Although melodramatically eventful, soap operas such as this also have a luxury of space that makes them seem more naturalistic; indeed, the economics of the form demand long scenes, and conversations that a 22-episodes-per-season weekly series might dispense with in half a dozen lines of dialogue may be drawn out, as here, for pages. You spend more time even with the minor characters; the apparent villains grow less apparently villainous.\" \n\nSoap opera storylines run concurrently, intersect and lead into further developments. An individual episode of a soap opera will generally switch between several different concurrent narrative threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent of each other. Each episode may feature some of the show's current storylines, but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials and those that are broadcast each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week's worth of episodes. Soap operas rarely bring all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends, there are several other story threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger, and the season finale (if a soap incorporates a break between seasons) ends in the same way, only to be resolved when the show returns for the start of a new yearly broadcast.\n\nEvening soap operas and those that air at a rate of one episode per week are more likely to feature the entire cast in each episode, and to represent all current storylines in each episode. Evening soap operas and serials that run for only part of the year tend to bring things to a dramatic end-of-season cliffhanger.\n\nIn 1976, Time magazine described American daytime television as \"TV's richest market,\" noting the loyalty of the soap opera fan base and the expansion of several half-hour series into hour-long broadcasts in order to maximize ad revenues.  The article explained that at that time, many prime time series lost money, while daytime serials earned profits several times more than their production costs. The issue's cover notably featured its first daytime soap stars, Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes of Days of Our Lives,   a married couple whose onscreen and real-life romance was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press at large. \n\nPlots and storylines\n\nThe main characteristics that define soap operas are \"an emphasis on family life, personal relationships, sexual dramas, emotional and moral conflicts; some coverage of topical issues; set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations\".Bowles, p. 119. Fitting in with these characteristics, most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place, or focus on a large extended family. The storylines follow the day-to-day activities and personal relationships of these characters. \"Soap narratives, like those of film melodramas, are marked by what Steve Neale has described as 'chance happenings, coincidences, missed meetings, sudden conversions, last-minute rescues and revelations, deus ex machina endings.'\" These elements may be found across the gamut of soap operas, from EastEnders to Dallas.Geraghty, p. 30.\n\nIn many soap operas, in particular daytime serials in the United States, the characters are frequently attractive, seductive, glamorous and wealthy. Soap operas from the United Kingdom and Australia tend to focus on more everyday characters and situations, and are frequently set in working class environments.  Many of the soaps produced in those two countries explore social realist storylines such as family discord, marriage breakdown or financial problems. Both UK and Australian soap operas feature comedic elements, often by way of affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man, presented as a sort of comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them. This diverges from U.S. soap operas where such comedy is rare. UK soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting \"reality\" or purport to have a \"realistic\" style.  UK soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location. As examples, EastEnders focuses on the tough and grim life in London's east end; while Coronation Street invokes Manchester and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of \"Northern straight talking\".Geraghty, p. 35.\n\nRomance, secret relationships, extramarital affairs, and genuine love have been the basis for many soap opera storylines. In U.S. daytime serials, the most popular soap opera characters, and the most popular storylines, often involved a romance of the sort presented in paperback romance novels. Soap opera storylines sometimes weave intricate, convoluted and sometimes confusing tales of characters who have affairs, meet mysterious strangers and fall in love, and who commit adultery, all of which keeps audiences hooked on the unfolding story twists. Crimes such as kidnapping, rape, and even murder may go unpunished if the perpetrator is to be retained in the ongoing story.\n\nAustralian and UK soap operas also feature a significant proportion of romance storylines. In Russia, most popular serials explore the \"romantic quality\" of criminal and/or oligarch life.\n\nIn soap opera storylines, previously unknown children, siblings and twins (including the evil variety) of established characters often emerge to upset and reinvigorate the set of relationships examined by the series. Unexpected calamities disrupt weddings, childbirths, and other major life events with unusual frequency.\n\nMuch like comic books – another popular form of linear storytelling pioneered in the U.S. during the 20th Century – a character's death is not guaranteed to be permanent. On The Bold and the Beautiful, Taylor Forrester (Hunter Tylo) was shown to flatline and have a funeral. When Tylo reprised the character in 2005, a retcon explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma.\n\nStunts and complex physical action are largely absent, especially from daytime serials. Such story events often take place offscreen and are referred to in dialogue instead of being shown. This is because stunts or action scenes are difficult to adequately depict visually without complex action, multiple takes, and post production editing. When episodes were broadcast live, post production work was impossible. Though all serials have long switched to being taped, extensive post production work and multiple takes, while possible, are not feasible due to the tight taping schedules and low budgets.\n\nUnited States\n\nDaytime serials on television\n\nThe first daytime TV soap opera in America was These Are My Children in 1949, though earlier melodramas had aired in the evenings as once-a-week programs. Soap operas quickly became a fixture of American daytime television in the early 1950s, joined by game shows, sitcom reruns and talk shows.\n\nIn 1988, H. Wesley Kenney, who at the time served as the executive producer of General Hospital, said to The New York Times: \n\nMany long-running U.S. soap operas established particular environments for their stories. The Doctors and General Hospital, in the beginning, told stories almost exclusively from inside the confines of a hospital. As the World Turns dealt heavily with Chris Hughes' law practice and the travails of his wife Nancy who, tired of being \"the loyal housewife\" in the 1970s, became one of the first older women on the American serials to enter the workforce. Guiding Light dealt with Bert Bauer (Charita Bauer) and her alcoholic husband Bill, and their endless marital troubles. When Bert's status shifted to caring mother and town matriarch, her children's marital troubles were showcased. Search for Tomorrow mostly told its story through the eyes of Joanne Gardner (Mary Stuart). Even when stories revolved around other characters, Joanne was frequently a key player in their storylines. Days of our Lives initially focused on Dr. Tom Horton and his steadfast wife Alice. The show later branched out to focus more on their five children. The Edge of Night featured as its central character Mike Karr, a police detective (later an attorney), and largely dealt with organized crime. The Young and the Restless first focused on two families, the prosperous Brooks family with four daughters, and the working class Foster family of a single working mother with three children. Its storylines explored realistic problems including cancer, mental illness, poverty and infidelity.\n\nIn contrast, Dark Shadows (1966–1971) and Port Charles (1997–2003) featured supernatural characters and dealt with fantasy and horror storylines. Their characters included vampires, witches, ghosts, goblins and angels.\n\nThe American soap opera Guiding Light (originally titled The Guiding Light until 1975) started as a radio drama in January 1937 and subsequently transferred to television in June 1952. With the exception of several years in the late 1940s when the show's creator Irna Phillips was involved in a dispute with Procter & Gamble, Guiding Light was heard or seen nearly every weekday since it began, until 2009 making it the longest story ever told in a broadcast medium.\n\nOriginally serials were broadcast as fifteen-minute installments each weekday in daytime slots. In 1956, As the World Turns and The Edge of Night, both produced by Procter & Gamble Productions, debuted as the first half-hour soap operas on the CBS television network. All soap operas broadcast half-hour episodes by the end of the 1960s. With increased popularity in the 1970s, most soap operas had expanded to an hour in length by the end of the decade (Another World even expanded to 90 minutes for a short time). More than half of the serials had expanded to one-hour episodes by 1980. As of 2012, three of the four U.S. serials air one hour episodes each weekday; only The Bold and the Beautiful airs 30-minute episodes.\n\nSoap operas were originally broadcast live from the studio, creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling similar to that of a stage play. As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time in New York City, a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theatre during breaks from their soap roles. In the 1960s and 1970s, new serials such as General Hospital, Days of our Lives and The Young and the Restless were produced in Los Angeles. Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York-produced soap operas, which were becoming more costly to perform. By the early 1970s, nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped. As the World Turns and The Edge of Night were the last to make the switch, in 1975.\n\nPort Charles used the practice of running 13-week \"story arcs,\" in which the main events of the arc are played out and wrapped up over the 13 weeks, although some storylines did continue over more than one arc. According to the 2006 Preview issue of Soap Opera Digest, it was briefly discussed that all ABC shows might do telenovela arcs, but this was rejected.\n\nThough U.S. daytime soap operas are not generally rerun by their networks, occasionally they are rebroadcast elsewhere; CBS and ABC have made exceptions to this, airing older episodes (either those aired earlier in the current season or those aired years prior) on major holidays when special event programming is not scheduled. Early episodes of Dark Shadows were rerun on PBS member stations in the early 1970s after the show's cancellation, and the entire series (except for a single missing episode) was rerun on the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s. After The Edge of Nights 1984 cancellation, reruns of the show's final five years were shown late nights on USA Network from 1985 to 1989. On January 20, 2000, a digital cable and satellite network dedicated to the genre, SOAPnet, began re-airing soaps that originally aired on ABC, NBC and CBS.\n\nNewer broadcast networks since the late 1980s, such as Fox and cable television networks, have largely eschewed soap operas in their daytime schedules, instead running syndicated programming and reruns. No cable television outlet has produced its own daytime serial, although DirecTV's The 101 Network took over existing serial Passions, continuing production for one season; while TBS and CBN Cable Network respectively aired their own soap operas, The Catlins (a primetime soap that utilized the daily episode format of its daytime counterparts) and Another Life (a soap that combined standard serial drama with religious overtones), during the 1980s. Fox, the fourth \"major network,\" carried a short lived daytime soap Tribes in 1990. Yet other than this and a couple of pilot attempts, Fox mainly stayed away from daytime soaps, and has not attempted them since their ascension to major-network status in 1994 (it did later attempt a series of daily prime time soaps, which aired on newly created sister network MyNetworkTV, but the experiment was largely a failure).\n\nDue to the masses of episodes produced for a series, release of soap operas to DVD (a popular venue for distribution of current and vintage television series) is considered impractical. With the exception of occasional specials, daytime soap operas are notable by their absence from DVD release schedules (an exception being the supernatural soap opera, Dark Shadows, which did receive an essentially complete release on both VHS and DVD; the single lost episode #1219 is reconstructed by means of an off-the-air audio recording, still images, and recap material from adjacent episodes).\n\nPerformers\n\nSee List of longest-serving soap opera actors\nDue to the longevity of these shows, it is not uncommon for a single character to be played by multiple actors. The key character of Mike Karr on The Edge of Night was played by three different actors.\n\nConversely, several actors have remained playing the same character for many years, or decades even. Helen Wagner played Hughes family matriarch Nancy Hughes on American soap As the World Turns from its April 2, 1956 debut through her death in May 2010. She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records  as the actor with the longest uninterrupted performance in a single role. A number of performers played roles for twenty years or longer, occasionally on more than one show. Rachel Ames played Audrey Hardy on both General Hospital and Port Charles from 1964 until 2007, and returned in 2009. Susan Lucci played Erica Kane in All My Children from the show's debut in January 1970 until it ended its network television run on ABC on September 23, 2011. Erika Slezak played Victoria Lord #3 on One Life to Live from 1971 until the show ended its network television run on ABC on January 13, 2012 and resumed the role in its short-lived online revival on April 29, 2013. \n\nOther actors have played several characters on different shows.  Millette Alexander, Bernard Barrow, Doris Belack, David Canary, Judith Chapman, Jordan Charney, Joan Copeland, Nicolas Coster, Jacqueline Courtney, Louis Edmonds, Dan Hamilton, Don Hastings, Vincent Irizarry, Lenore Kasdorf, Teri Keane, Lois Kibbee, John Loprieno, Maeve McGuire, James Mitchell, Christopher Pennock, Gary Pillar, Antony Ponzini, William Prince, Louise Shaffer, and Diana van der Vlis, among many others, have all played multiple soap roles.\n\nEvolution of the daytime serial\n\nFor several decades, most daytime soap operas concentrated on family and marital discord, legal drama and romance. The action rarely left interior settings, and many shows were set in fictional, medium-sized Midwestern towns.\n\nExterior shots were slowly incorporated into the series The Edge of Night and Dark Shadows. Unlike many earlier serials which were set in fictional towns, The Best of Everything and Ryan's Hope were set in a real-world location, New York City.\n\nThe first exotic location shoot was made by All My Children, to St. Croix in 1978. Many other soap operas planned lavish storylines after the success of the All My Children shoot. Soap operas Another World and Guiding Light both went to St. Croix in 1980, the former show culminating a long-running storyline between popular characters Mac, Rachel and Janice, and the latter to serve as an exotic setting for Alan Spaulding and Rita Bauer's torrid affair. Search for Tomorrow taped for two weeks in Hong Kong in 1981. Later that year, some of the cast and crew ventured to Jamaica to tape a love consummation storyline between the characters of Garth and Kathy.\n\nDuring the 1980s, perhaps as a reaction to the evening drama series that were gaining high ratings, daytime serials began to incorporate action and adventure storylines, more big-business intrigue, and an increased emphasis on youthful romance.\n\nOne of the first and most popular couples was Luke Spencer and Laura Webber on General Hospital. Luke and Laura helped to attract both male and female fans. Even actress Elizabeth Taylor was a fan and at her own request was given a guest role in Luke and Laura's wedding episode. Luke and Laura's popularity led to other soap producers striving to reproduce this success by attempting to create supercouples of their own.\n\nWith increasingly bizarre action storylines coming into vogue, Luke and Laura saved the world from being frozen, brought a mobster down by finding his black book in a Left-Handed Boy Statue, and helped a Princess find her Aztec Treasure in Mexico. Other soap operas attempted similar adventure storylines, often featuring footage shot on location – frequently in exotic locales.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the mob, action and adventure stories fell out of favor with producers, due to generally declining ratings for daytime soap operas at the time, and the resultant budget cuts. In addition, soap operas were no longer able to go on expensive location shoots overseas as they were able to do in the 1980s. During that decade, soap operas increasingly focused on younger characters and social issues, such as Erica Kane's drug addiction on All My Children, the re-emergence of Viki Lord's multiple personality disorder on One Life to Live, and Stuart Chandler dealing with his wife Cindy dying of AIDS on All My Children. Other social issues included cancer, rape, abortion, homophobia, and racism.\n\nSome shows during the 2000s incorporated supernatural and science fiction elements into their storylines. One of the main characters on the earlier soap opera Dark Shadows were Barnabas Collins, a vampire, and One Life to Live featured an angel named Virgil. Both shows featured characters who traveled to and from the past.\n\nTraditional grammar of daytime serials\n\nModern U.S. daytime soap operas largely stay true to the original soap opera format. The duration and format of storylines and the visual grammar employed by U.S. daytime serials set them apart from soap operas in other countries and from evening soap operas. Stylistically, UK and Australian soap operas, which are usually produced for early evening timeslots, fall somewhere in-between U.S. daytime and evening soap operas. Similar to U.S. daytime soap operas, UK and Australian serials are shot on videotape, and the cast and storylines are rotated across the week's episodes so that each cast member will appear in some but not all episodes. UK and Australian soap operas move through storylines at a faster rate than daytime serials, making them closer to U.S. evening soap operas in this regard.\n\nAmerican daytime soap operas feature stylistic elements that set them apart from other shows:\n* A construct unique to U.S. daytime serials is the format where the action will cut between various conversations, returning to each at the precise moment it was left. This is the most significant distinction between U.S. daytime soap operas and other forms of U.S. television drama, which generally allow for narrative time to pass, off-screen, between the scenes depicted. On occasion, a character or characters involved a conversation earlier in that act may appear in a different setting later in the same act.\n* In U.S. daytime soap operas, scenes often end with a pregnant pause and a close-up on the character. There will be no dialogue for several seconds, while the music builds before cutting to a commercial or a new scene. This kind of segue is referred to in the industry as a \"tag.\"\n* The traditional three-point lighting set-up routinely used in filmmaking and television production is also used on daytime soap operas, sometimes with accentuated back lighting to lift actors out of the background. This is useful in programs like soap operas which are shot on videotape in small interior sets. The backlight is frequently more subtle on filmed productions shot on location and in larger sets.\n* Domestic interiors are often furnished with stained wood wall panels and furniture, and items of brown leather furniture. This is to give a sumptuous and luxurious look suggesting the wealth of the characters. Daytime serials often foreground other sumptuous elements of set decoration; presenting a \"mid-shot of characters viewed through a frame of lavish floral displays, glittering crystal decanters or gleaming antique furniture\".\n* Few U.S. daytime soap operas routinely feature location or exterior-shot footage (Guiding Light began shooting many of its scenes outdoors in its final two seasons). Often an outdoor locale is recreated in the studio. Australian and UK daily soap operas invariably feature a certain amount of exterior shot footage in every episode. This is usually shot in the same location and often on a purpose-built set, with new exterior locations for particular events.\n* The visual quality of a soap opera is usually lower than prime time U.S. television drama series due to the lower budgets and quicker production times. This is also because soap operas are recorded on videotape using a multi-camera setup, unlike primetime productions which are usually shot on film and frequently use the single camera shooting style. Because of the lower resolution of video images, and also because of the emotional situations portrayed in soap operas, daytime serials make heavy use of close-up shots. Programs in the United States did not make the full conversion to high definition broadcasting until September 2011, when The Bold and the Beautiful became the last soap to convert to the format; One Life to Live was an exception to this, as it continued to be produced and broadcast in standard definition – albeit in the 16:9 aspect ratio – until the end of its run on ABC in January 2012.\n* Soap operas have idiosyncratic blocking techniques. In one common situation, a romantically involved couple starts a conversation face-to-face, then one character will turn 180° and face away from the other character while the conversation continues. This allows both characters to appear together in a single shot, and both facing the audience. This is unrealistic in real life and is not frequently seen in film or on television outside U.S. daytime serials, but it is an accepted soap opera convention, sometimes referred to as a \"Two Shot West.\"\n* Because of the \"escapist\" tone of the genre and due to the large number of cast members employed by each program (usually totaling around 30 to 35 actors for hour-long soaps, and 15 to 25 for those lasting a half-hour), daytime soap operas have traditionally listed all contract cast members (as well as recurring and guest actors) during the closing credits, instead of the opening title sequence. Until the 1990s, these series listed only a few of the principal actors at the end of the episode in certain episodes airing on Monday through Thursdays. Because of the aforementioned reasons, an extended credit sequence featuring a complete list of the show's cast members – listed alongside the characters they portray – typically airs at least once per week (usually on the Friday show; although since the 2000s, most soap operas – with General Hospital as one of the lone exceptions – have randomized the day the cast list is shown). The Young and the Restless became the first American daytime soap to include the names of its contract actors in the opening credits in 1999 (although due to the large number of actors on contract with the show at one time, it utilizes different versions of the title sequence with a randomized list of about six actors); The Bold and the Beautiful began listing its entire main cast (as well as some actors appearing on a recurring basis) in 2005, with General Hospital following suit from 2010 to 2013. \n\nDecline\n\nStatistics and trends\n\nSoap opera ratings have significantly fallen in the U.S. since the 2000s. No new major daytime soap opera has been created since Passions in 1999, while many have been cancelled. Since January 2012, four daytime soap operas – General Hospital, Days of our Lives, The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful – continue to air on the three major networks, down from a total of 12 during the 1990–91 season and a high of 19 in the 1969–70 season. This marks the first time since 1953 that there have been only four soap operas airing on broadcast television.  The Young and the Restless, the highest-rated soap opera from 1988 to the present, had fewer than 5 million daily viewers as of February 2012, a number exceeded by several non-scripted programs such as Judge Judy.  Circulations of soap opera magazines have decreased and some have even ceased publication.  SOAPnet, which largely aired soap opera reruns, began to be phased out in 2012 and fully ceased operations the following year.Villarreal, Yvonne. \"Show Tracker: What You're Watching — [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/03/disney-junior-247-channel-launches-friday.html Disney Junior 24/7 channel launches Friday].\" Los Angeles Times Blog, 22 March 2012. Web. 19 April 2012. The Daytime Emmy Awards, which honor soap operas and other daytime shows, moved from primetime network television to smaller cable channels in 2012, then failed to get any TV broadcast at all in 2014 and 2016. \n\nSeveral of America's most established soaps ended between 2009 and 2012. The longest-running drama in television and radio history, Guiding Light, barely reached 2.1 million daily viewers in 2009 and ended on September 18 of that year, after a 57-year run.  As the World Turns aired its final episode on September 17, 2010 after a 54-year run. As the World Turns was the last of 20 soap operas produced by Procter & Gamble, the soap and consumer goods company from which the genre got its name.  As The World Turns and Guiding Light were also among the last of the soaps that originated from New York City. All My Children, another New York-based soap, moved its production out to Los Angeles in an effort to reduce costs and raise sagging ratings; however, it along with One Life to Live, each with a four-decade-plus run, were both cancelled in 2011. All My Children aired its network finale in September 2011 with One Life to Live following suit in January 2012.  Both All My Children and One Life to Live were briefly revived online in 2013, before being canceled again that same year.\n\nCauses\n\nAs women increasingly worked outside of the home, daytime television viewing declined. New generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soap operas with their mothers, leaving the shows' long and complex storylines foreign to younger audiences. Now, as viewers age, ratings continue to drop among young adult women, the demographic group that soap opera advertisers pay the most for.  Those who might watch in workplace breakrooms are not counted, as Nielsen does not track television viewing outside the home. The rise of cable and the internet has also provided new sources of entertainment during the day. The genre's decline has additionally been attributed to reality television displacing soap operas as TV's dominant form of melodrama.  A precursor to reality TV, the televised 1994-95 O. J. Simpson murder case, both preempted and competed with an entire season of soaps, transforming viewing habits and leaving soap operas with 10 percent audience declines in its wake.  \n\nDaytime programming alternatives such as talk shows, game shows, and court shows cost up to 50% less to produce than scripted dramas,  making those formats more profitable and attractive to networks, even if they receive the same or slightly lower ratings than soap operas. A network may even prefer to return a timeslot to its local stations to keeping a soap opera with disappointing ratings on the air, as was the case with Sunset Beach and Port Charles. Compounding the financial pressure on scripted programming in the 2007–2010 period was a decline in advertising during the Great Recession, which led shows to reduce their budgets and cast sizes.  In addition to these external factors, a litany of production decisions has been cited by soap opera fans as contributing to the genre's decline, such as cliched plots, a lack of diversity that narrowed audience appeal, and the elimination of core families. \n\nThe primetime serial\n\nSerials produced for primetime slots have also found success. The first primetime soap opera was Faraway Hill (1946), which aired on October 2, 1946, on the now-defunct DuMont Television Network.  Faraway Hill ran for 12 episodes and was primarily broadcast live, interspersed with short pre-recorded film clips and still photos to remind the audience of the previous week's episode.\n\nThe first long-running prime time soap opera was Peyton Place (1964–1969) on ABC. It was based in part on the eponymous 1957 film (which, in turn, was based on the 1956 novel).\n\nThe popularity of Peyton Place prompted the CBS network to spin-off popular As the World Turns character Lisa Miller into her own evening soap opera, Our Private World (originally titled \"The Woman Lisa\" in its planning stages). Our Private World was broadcast from May to September 1965. The character of Lisa returned to As The World Turns after the series ended.\n\nThe structure of Peyton Place, with its episodic plots and long-running story arcs, set the mold for the primetime serials of the 1980s when the format reached its pinnacle.\n\nThe successful primetime serials of the 1980s included Dallas, Dynasty, Knots Landing and Falcon Crest. These shows frequently dealt with wealthy families, and their personal and big-business travails. Common characteristics were sumptuous sets and costumes, complex storylines examining business schemes and intrigue, and spectacular disaster cliffhanger situations. Each of these series featured a wealthy, domineering, promiscuous, and passionate antagonist as a key character in the storyline – respectively, J. R. Ewing, Alexis Colby, Abby Cunningham and Angela Channing. These villainous schemers became immensely popular figures that audiences \"loved to hate\".\n\nUnlike daytime serials, which are shot on video in a studio using the multi-camera setup, these evening series were shot on film using a single camera setup, and featured substantial location-shot footage, often in picturesque locales. Dallas, its spin-off Knots Landing, and Falcon Crest all initially featured episodes with self-contained stories and specific guest stars who appeared in just that episode. Each story was completely resolved by the end of the episode, and there were no end-of-episode cliffhangers. After the first couple of seasons, all three shows changed their story format to that of a pure soap opera, with interwoven ongoing narratives that ran over several episodes. Dynasty featured this format throughout its run.\n\nThe soap opera's distinctive open plot structure and complex continuity was increasingly incorporated into American primetime television programs of the period. The first significant drama series to do this was Hill Street Blues. This series, produced by Steven Bochco, featured many elements borrowed from soap operas, such as an ensemble cast, multi-episode storylines, and extensive character development over the course of the series. It and the later Cagney & Lacey overlaid the police series formula with ongoing narratives exploring the personal lives and interpersonal relationships of the regular characters.  The success of these series prompted other drama series, such as St. Elsewhere and situation comedy series, to incorporate serialized stories and story structure to varying degrees.\n\nThe primetime soap operas and drama series of the 1990s, such as Beverly Hills, 90210, Melrose Place, Party of Five, and Dawson's Creek, focused more on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the primetime soap opera format with shows such as Desperate Housewives, Grey's Anatomy, Brothers & Sisters, Ugly Betty, Private Practice, and more recently Revenge, Nashville, Scandal, Mistresses, and formerly Ringer, which its sister production company ABC Studios co-produced with CBS Television Studios for The CW. While not soaps in the traditional sense, these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their high drama mixed with humor, and are soap operas by definition. These successes led to NBC's launching serials, including Heroes and Friday Night Lights. The upstart MyNetworkTV, a sister network of Fox, launched a line of primetime telenovelas (a genre similar to soap operas in terms of content) upon its launch in September 2006, but discontinued its use of the format in 2007, after disappointing ratings.\n\nOn June 13, 2012, Dallas, a continuation of the 1978 original series premiered on the cable network, TNT. The revived series, which was canceled after three seasons in 2014, delivered solid ratings for the channel. In 2012, Nick at Nite debuted a primetime soap opera, Hollywood Heights, which aired episodes five nights a week (on Monday through Fridays) in a manner similar to a daytime soap opera, instead of the once-a-week episode output common of other primetime soaps. The series, which was an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela Alcanzar una estrella, suffered from low ratings (generally receiving less than one million viewers) and was later moved to sister cable channel TeenNick halfway through its run to burn off the remaining episodes.\n\nIn 2015, Fox debuted Empire, a primetime musical serial centering on the power struggle between family members within the titular recording company. Created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong and led by Academy Award nominees Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, the drama premiered to high ratings. The show is strongly influenced by other works such as William Shakespeare's King Lear, James Goldman's The Lion in Winter and the 1980s soap opera Dynasty. Also in 2015, E! introduced The Royals, a series following the life and drama of a fictional English Royal family, which was also inspired by Dynasty (even featuring Joan Collins as the Queen's mother). In addition, ABC debuted a primetime soap opera Blood & Oil, following a young couple looking to make money off the modern-day Williston oil boom, premiering on September 27, 2015 during the 2015-16 TV season.\n\nTelenovelas\n\nSpanish-language networks, chiefly Univision and Telemundo, have found success airing telenovelas for America's growing Hispanic market. Both originally produced and imported Latin American dramas are popular features of the networks' daytime and primetime lineups, sometimes beating English-language networks in the ratings. \n\nOnline serials\n\nSome web series are soap operas, Such as Degrassi: In Session, Created By; Jahni Heron. Or Venice: The Series. In 2013, production company Prospect Park revived All My Children and One Life to Live for the web, retaining original creator Agnes Nixon as a consultant and keeping many of the same actors (Prospect Park purchased the rights to both series months after their cancellations by ABC in 2011, although it initially suspended plans to relaunch the soaps later that same year due to issues receiving approval from acting and production unions).  Each show initially produced four half-hour episodes a week, but quickly cut back to two half-hour episodes each.  In the midst of (though not directly related to) a lawsuit between Prospect Park and ABC, the experiment ended that same year, with both shows being canceled again.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nSee List of longest-serving soap opera actors\nIn the United Kingdom, soap operas are one of the most popular genres, with most being broadcast during prime time. In comparison to U.S. serials which frequently portray romantic storylines in sumptuous and glamorous locales, most UK soap operas focus on more everyday, working-class communities.\n\nThe most popular soaps are Coronation Street, EastEnders, Emmerdale, Hollyoaks, Doctors, and the Australian produced Neighbours and Home and Away. The first three of these are consistently among the highest-rated shows on British television. Such is the magnitude of the popularity of the soap genre in the UK that all television serials in the country are reputedly enjoyed by members of the British Royal Family, including Elizabeth II herself.\n\nThe 1986 Christmas Day episode of EastEnders is often referred to as the highest-rated UK soap opera episode ever, with 30.15 million viewers (in 2007, the UK had approximately 54 million television viewers). The figure of 30.15 million was actually a combination of the original broadcast which had just over 19 million viewers, and the Sunday omnibus edition with 10 million viewers. The combined 30.15 million audience figure makes the aforementioned Christmas Day 1986 episode of EastEnders the highest-rated single-channel broadcast in the history of UK television. The 1970 splashdown of Apollo 13 (28.6 million viewers) and Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 (32.1 million viewers) were transmitted on both BBC One and ITV. \n\nCoronation Street, Emmerdale and EastEnders are popularly known as the \"flagship\" soaps, as they are respectively the highest-rated programs on ITV and the BBC. Poor ratings for a UK flagship serial sometimes brings with it questions about the associated channel. The soaps are so popular they are not routinely scheduled against each other. Episodes of serials have clashed only on isolated occasions when extended episodes have been broadcast.\n\nOrigins\n\nSoap operas in the UK began on radio and consequently were associated with the BBC. It had resisted soaps as antithetical to its quality image, but began broadcasting Front Line Family in April 1941 on its North American shortwave service to encourage American intervention on Britain's behalf in World War II.  The BBC continues to broadcast the world's longest-running radio soap, The Archers, which has been running nationally since 1951. It is currently broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and continues to attract over five million listeners, or roughly 25% of the radio listening population of the UK at that time of the evening.\n\nAn early television serial was The Grove Family on the BBC, which produced 148 episodes from 1954 to 1957. The program was broadcast live and only a handful of recordings were retained in the archives. The UK's first twice-weekly serial was ITV's Emergency - Ward 10, running from 1957 until 1967.\n\nIn the 1960s Coronation Street revolutionised UK television and quickly became a British institution. The BBC also produced several serials: Compact was about the staff of a women's magazine; The Newcomers was about the upheaval caused by a large firm setting up a plant in a small town; United! contained 147 episodes and focused on a football team; 199 Park Lane (1965) was an upper class serial, which ran for only 18 episodes. None of these serials came close to making the same impact as Coronation Street. Indeed, most of the 1960s BBC serials were largely wiped.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Coronation Streets main rival was Crossroads, a daily serial that began in 1964 and aired on ITV in the early evening. Crossroads was set in a Birmingham motel and, although the program was popular, its purported low technical standard and bad acting were much mocked. By the 1980s, its ratings had begun to decline. Several attempts to revamp the program through cast changes and, later, expanding the focus from the motel to the surrounding community were unsuccessful. Crossroads was cancelled in 1988 (a new version of Crossroads was later produced, running from 2001 until 2003).\n\nA later rival to Coronation Street was ITV's Emmerdale Farm (later renamed Emmerdale), which began in 1972 in a daytime slot and was set in rural Yorkshire. Increased viewership resulted in Emmerdale being moved to a prime-time slot in the 1980s.\n\nPobol y Cwm (People of the Valley) is a Welsh language serial that has been produced by the BBC since October 1974, and is the longest-running television soap opera produced by the broadcaster. Pobol y Cwm was originally broadcast on BBC Wales television from 1974 to 1982; it was then moved to the Welsh-language television station S4C when it opened in November 1982. The program was occasionally shown on BBC1 in London during periods of regional optout in the mid- to late 1970s. Pobol y Cwm was briefly shown in the rest of the UK in 1994 on BBC2, with English subtitles; it is consistently the most watched program each week on S4C. \n\nThe 1980s\n\nDaytime soap operas were non-existent until the 1970s because there was virtually no daytime television in the UK. ITV introduced General Hospital, which later moved to a prime time slot. In 1980,  Scottish Television debuted Take the High Road, which lasted for over twenty years. Later, daytime slots were filled with an influx of Australian soap operas such as The Sullivans (aired on ITV from 1977), The Young Doctors (from 1982), Sons and Daughters (from 1983), A Country Practice (from 1982), Richmond Hill (from 1988 to 1989) and eventually, Neighbours was acquired by the BBC in 1986, and Home and Away aired on ITV beginning in 1989. These achieved significant levels of popularity; Neighbours and Home and Away were moved to early-evening slots, helping begin the UK soap opera boom in the late 1980s.\n\nThe day Channel 4 began operations in 1982 it launched its own soap, the Liverpool-based Brookside, which would redefine soaps over the next decade. The focus of Brookside was different from earlier soap operas in the UK; it was set in a middle-class new-build cul-de-sac, unlike Coronation Street and Emmerdale Farm, which were set in established working-class communities. The characters in Brookside were generally either people who had advanced themselves from inner-city council estates, or the upper middle-class who had fallen on hard times. Though Brookside was still broadcast in a pre-watershed slot (8.00 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on weekdays, around 5.00 p.m. for the omnibus on Saturdays), it was more liberal than other soaps of the time: the dialogue regularly included expletives. This stemmed from the overall more liberal policy of the channel during that period. The soap was also heavily politicised. Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson), a militant trade-unionist anti-hero, was the most overtly political character. Storylines were often more sensationalist than on other soaps (throughout the soap's history, there were two armed sieges on the street) and were staged more graphically with violence (particularly, rape) often being featured.\n\nIn 1985, the BBC's London-based soap opera EastEnders debuted and became a near instant success with viewers and critics alike, with the first episode attracting over 17 million viewers. The Christmas Day 1986 episode was watched by 30.15 million viewers and contained a scene in which divorce papers were served to Angie Watts by her husband Den. Critics talked about the downfall of Coronation Street, but the program continued to perform successfully. In 1994, when the two serials were scheduled opposite each other, Coronation Street won the slot. For the better part of ten years,, EastEnders has shared the number one position with Coronation Street, with varying degrees of difference between the two.\n\nA notable success in pioneering late-night broadcasting, in October 1984, Yorkshire Television began airing the cult Australian soap opera Prisoner, which originally ran from 1979 to 1986. It was eventually broadcast on all regions of the UK in differing slots, usually around 23:00 (but never before 22:30 in any region), under the title Prisoner: Cell Block H. It was probably most popular in the Midlands where Central Television consistently broadcast the serial three times a week from 1987 to 1991. Its airing in the UK was staggered, so different regions of the country saw it at a different pace. The program was immensely successful, regularly achieving 10 million viewers when all regions' ratings per episode were added together. Central bowed to fan pressure to repeat the soap, of which the first 95 episodes aired. Then, rival station Channel 5 also acquired rights to repeat the entire rerun of the program, starting in 1997. All 692 episodes have since been released on DVD in the UK.\n\nThe 1990s\n\nIn 1992, the BBC debuted Eldorado to alternate with EastEnders. The program was heavily criticised and only lasted one year. Nevertheless, soap operas gained increasing prominence on UK television schedules. In 1995, Channel 4 premiered Hollyoaks, a soap with a youth focus. When Channel 5 launched in March 1997, it debuted the soap opera Family Affairs, which was formatted as a weekdaily soap, airing Monday through Fridays.\n\nBrooksides premise evolved during the 1990s, phasing out the politicised stories of the 1980s and shifting the emphasis to controversial and sensationalist stories such as child rape, sibling incest, religious cults and drug addiction, including the infamous 'body under the patio' storyline which ran from 1993 to 1995, and gave the serial its highest ratings ever with 9 million viewers.\n\nCoronation Street and Brookside began releasing straight-to-video features. The Coronation Street releases generally kept the pace and style of conventional programs episodes with the action set in foreign locations. The Brookside releases were set in the program's usual location, but featured stories with adult content not allowed on television pre-watershed, with these releases given '18' certificates.\n\nEmmerdale Farm was renamed Emmerdale in 1989. The series was revamped in 1993 with many changes executed via the crash of a passenger jet that partially destroyed the village and killed several characters. This attracted criticism as it was broadcast near the fifth anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing. The storyline drew the soap its highest ever audience of 18 million viewers. The revamp was a success and Emmerdale grew in popularity.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Brookside, Coronation Street, EastEnders and Emmerdale continued to flourish. Each increased the number of episodes that aired on a weekly basis by at least one, further defining soap operas as the leading genre in British television.\n\nThe 2000s\n\nSince 2000, new soap operas have continued to be developed. Daytime drama Doctors began in March 2000, preceding Neighbours on BBC One. In 2002, as ratings for the Scottish serial High Road (formerly Take The High Road) continued to decline, BBC Scotland launched River City, which proved popular and effectively replaced High Road when it was cancelled in 2003. The long-running serial Brookside ended in November 2003 after 21 years on the air, leaving Hollyoaks as Channel 4's flagship serial.\n\nA new version of Crossroads featuring a mostly new cast was produced by Carlton Television for ITV in 2001. It did not achieve high ratings and was cancelled in 2003. In 2001, ITV also launched a new early-evening serial entitled Night and Day. This program too attracted low viewership and, after being shifted to a late night time slot, was cancelled in 2003. Family Affairs, which was broadcast opposite the racier Hollyoaks, never achieved significantly high ratings leading to several dramatic casting revamps and marked changes in style and even location over its run. By 2004, Family Affairs had a larger fan base and won its first awards, but was cancelled in late 2005.\n\nIn 2008, ITV premiered The Royal Today, a daily spin-off of popular 1960s-based drama The Royal, which had been running in a primetime slot since 2002. Just days later, soap opera parody programs Echo Beach premiered alongside its sister show, the comedy Moving Wallpaper. Both Echo Beach and The Royal Today ended after just one series due to low ratings. Radio soap opera Silver Street debuted on the BBC Asian Network in 2004. Poor ratings and criticism of the program led to its cancellation in 2010. \n\nFormat\n\nUK soap operas for many years usually only aired two nights a week. The exception was the original Crossroads which began as a weekdaily soap opera in the 1960s, but later had its number of weekly broadcasts reduced. Things started to change in 1989 when Coronation Street began airing three times a week. In 1996, it expanded again, to air four episodes a week. Brookside premiered in 1982 with two episodes a week. In 1990, it expanded to three episodes a week; the trend was followed by EastEnders in 1994 and Emmerdale in 1997, In 2000, the soap went five episodes a week. Family Affairs debuted as a weekdaily soap in 1997, producing five episodes a week throughout its entire run. The imported Neighbours screens as five new episodes a week, which are shown once at 1:45 p.m. and repeated at 5:30 p.m. on Channel 5 each weekday.\n\nCurrently, Coronation Street (which began airing two episodes on Monday nights in 2002) and Hollyoaks both produce five episodes a week, while EastEnders produces four each week. In 2002, Brookside expanded from three half-hour episodes on different weeknights to airing one 90-minute episode each week. In 2004, Emmerdale began airing six episodes a week. Doctors airs five episodes a week, and is the only soap without a weekend omnibus repeat screening. It was announced in June 2016 that starting late 2017, Coronation Street would air six episodes a week. \n\nDue to a January 2008 overhaul of the ITV network, the Sunday episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale were moved out of their slots. Coronation Street added a second episode on Friday evenings at 8:30 p.m. Emmerdales Tuesday edition was extended to an hour, putting it in direct competition with rival EastEnders.\n\nIn July 2009, the schedules of these serials were changed again. On 23 July 2009, Coronation Street moved from the Wednesday slot it held for 49 years, to Thursday evenings. Emmerdale reverted to running just one 30-minute episode on Tuesday evenings and the other 30-minute installment was moved to Thursday evenings. \n\nUK soap operas are shot on videotape in the studio using a multi-camera setup. Since the 1980s, these programs routinely feature scenes shot outdoors in each episode. This footage is shot on videotape on a purpose-built outdoor set that represents the community that the soap focuses on. During their early years, Coronation Street and Emmerdale used 16 mm film while scenes were shot on location. Later soap operas such as Hollyoaks and Family Affairs, started filming on high-definition video, a more modern filming process, as opposed to standard videotape, which features better quality and appears to look more like film than videotape.\n\nUK soap operas do not incorporate recap sequences at the beginning of each episode, which would be appropriate for the fact that when an episode ends, it picks up the story during the following episode. However, in 2012, Hollyoaks began airing a recap sequence at the beginning of each episode. With the exception of Hollyoaks, soap operas in the UK also lack incidental music, although EastEnders would sometimes feature music which plays over an ending scene if it was dramatic, with an alternative EastEnders theme known as \"Julia's theme\".\n\nAustralia\n\nSee List of longest-serving soap opera actors\nAustralia has had quite a number of well-known soap operas, some of which have gained cult followings in the UK, New Zealand and other countries. The majority of Australian television soap operas are produced for early evening or evening timeslots. They usually produce two or two-and-a-half hours of new material each week, either arranged as four or five half-hour episodes a week, or as two one-hour episodes. Stylistically, these series most closely resemble UK soap operas in that they are nearly always shot on videotape, are mainly recorded in a studio and use a multi-camera setup. The original Australian serials were shot entirely in-studio. During the 1970s occasional filmed inserts were used to incorporate sequences shot outdoors. Outdoor shooting later became commonplace and starting in the late 1970s, it became standard practice for some on-location footage to be featured in each episode of any Australian soap opera, often to capitalise on the attractiveness and exotic nature of these locations for international audiences.Bowles, p. 120. Most Australian soap operas focus on a mixed age range of middle-class characters and will regularly feature a range of locations where the various, disparate characters can meet and interact, such as the café, the surf club, the wine bar or the school.\n\nEarly serials\n\nThe genre began in Australia on radio, as it had in the United States and the United Kingdom. One such radio serial, Big Sister, featured actress Thelma Scott in the cast and aired nationally for five years beginning in 1942. Probably the best known Australian radio serial was the long-running soap opera Blue Hills which was created by Gwen Meredith and ran from 1949 to 1976. With the advent of Australian television in 1956, daytime television serials followed. The first Australian television soap opera was Autumn Affair (1958) featuring radio personality and Blue Hills star Queenie Ashton making the transition to television. Each episode of this serial ran for 15 minutes and aired each weekday on the Seven Network. Autumn Affair failed to secure a sponsor and ended in 1959 after 156 episodes. It was followed by The Story of Peter Grey (1961), another Seven Network weekday series aired in a daytime slot in 15-minute installments. The Story of Peter Grey ran for 164 episodes.\n\nThe first successful wave of Australian evening television soap operas started in 1967 with Bellbird, produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This rural-based serial screened in an early evening slot in 15-minute installments as a lead-in to the evening news. Bellbird was a moderate success but built-up a consistent and loyal viewer base, especially in rural areas, and enjoyed a ten-year run. Motel (1968) was Australia's first half-hour soap opera; the daytime soap had a short run of 132 episodes.\n\nThe 1970s\n\nThe first major soap opera hit in Australia was the sex-melodrama Number 96, a nighttime series produced by Cash Harmon Television for Network Ten, which debuted March 1972. The program dealt with such topics as homosexuality, adultery, drug use, rape-within-marriage and racism which had rarely been explored on Australian television programs before. The series became famous for its sex scenes and nudity and for its comedic characters, many of whom became cult heroes in Australia. By 1973, Number 96 had become Australia's highest-rated show. In 1974, the sexed-up antics of Number 96 prompted the creation of The Box, which rivaled it in terms of nudity and sexual situations and was scheduled in a nighttime slot. Produced by Crawford Productions, many critics considered The Box to be a more slickly produced and better written show than Number 96. The Box also aired on the Ten Network, programmed to run right after Number 96. For 1974 Number 96 was again the highest rating show on Australian television, and that year The Box occupied the number two spot.\n\nAlso in 1974, the Reg Grundy Organisation created its first soap opera, and significantly Australia's first teen soap opera, Class of '74. With its attempts to hint at the sex and sin shown more openly on Number 96 and The Box, its high school setting and early evening timeslot, Class of '74 came under intense scrutiny from the Broadcasting Control Board, who vetted scripts and altered entire storylines.\n\nBy 1975, both Number 96 and The Box, perhaps as a reaction to declining ratings for both shows, de-emphasised the sex and nudity shifting more towards comedic plots. Class of '74 was renamed Class of '75 and also added more slapstick comedy for its second year, but the revamped show's ratings declined, resulting in its cancellation in mid-1975. That year Cash Harmon's newly launched second soap The Unisexers failed in its early evening slot and was cancelled after three weeks; the Reg Grundy Organisation's second soap Until Tomorrow ran in a daytime slot for 180 episodes.\n\nA feature film version of Bellbird entitled Country Town was produced in 1971 by two of the show's stars, Gary Gray and Terry McDermott, without production involvement by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Number 96 and The Box also released feature film versions, both of which had the same title as the series, released in 1974 and 1975 respectively. As Australian television had broadcast in black and white until 1975, these theatrical releases all had the novelty of being in colour. The film versions of Number 96 and The Box also allowed more explicit nudity than could be shown on television at that time.\n\nIn November 1976 The Young Doctors debuted on the Nine Network. This Grundy Organization series eschewed the adult drama of Number 96 and The Box, focusing more on relationship drama and romance. It became a popular success but received few critical accolades. A week later The Sullivans, a carefully produced period serial chronicling the effects of World War II on a Melbourne family, also debuted on Nine. Produced by Crawford Productions, The Sullivans became a ratings success, attracted many positive reviews, and won television awards. During this period Number 96 re-introduced nudity into its episodes, with several much-publicised full-frontal nude scenes, a cast revamp and a new range of shock storylines designed to boost the show's declining ratings. Bellbird experienced changes to its broadcast pattern with episodes screening in 60 minute blocks, and later in 30 minute installments.\n \nBellbird, Number 96 and The Box, which had been experiencing declining ratings, were cancelled in 1977. Various attempts to revamp each of the shows with cast reshuffles or spectacular disaster storylines had proved only temporarily successful. The Young Doctors and The Sullivans continued to be popular. November 1977 saw the launch of successful soap opera/police procedural series Cop Shop (1977–1984) produced by Crawford Productions for Channel Seven. In early December 1977 Channel Ten debuted the Reg Grundy Organisation produced The Restless Years (1977–1981), a more standard soap drama focusing on several young school leavers.\n\nThe Seven Network, achieving success with Cop Shop produced by Crawford Productions, had Crawfords produce Skyways, a series with a similar format but set in an airport, to compete with the Nine Network's popular talk show The Don Lane Show. Skyways, which debuted in July 1979, emphasised adult situations including homosexuality, marriage problems, adultery, prostitution, drug use and smuggling, crime, suicide, political intrigue, and murder, and featured some nudity. Despite this, the program achieved only moderate ratings and was cancelled in mid-1981.\n\nThe 1980s\n\nThe Reg Grundy Organisation found major success with the women's-prison drama Prisoner (1979–1986) on Network Ten, and melodramatic family saga Sons and Daughters (1982–1987) on the Seven Network. Both shows achieved high ratings in their original runs, and unusually, found success in repeats after the programs ended.\n\nGrundy soap The Young Doctors and Crawford Productions' The Sullivans continued on the Nine Network until late 1982. Thereafter Nine attempted many new replacement soap operas produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation: Taurus Rising (1982), Waterloo Station (1983), Starting Out (1983) and Possession (1985), along with Prime Time  (1986) produced by Crawford Productions. None of these programs were successful and most were cancelled after only a few months. The Reg Grundy Organisation also created Neighbours, a suburban-based daily serial devised as a sedate family drama with some comedic and lightweight situations, for the Seven Network in 1985.\n\nProduced in Melbourne at the studios of HSV-7, Neighbours achieved high ratings in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, but not in Sydney, where it aired at 5.30 p.m. placing it against the hit dating game show Perfect Match on Channel 10. The Seven Network's Sydney station ATN-7 quickly lost interest in Neighbours as a result of the low ratings in Sydney. HSV-7 in Melbourne lobbied heavily to keep Neighbours on the air, but ATN-7 managed to convince the rest of the network to cancel the show and instead keep ATN-7's own Sydney-based dramas A Country Practice and Sons and Daughters.\n\nAfter the network cancelled Neighbours, it was immediately picked up by Channel Ten, which revamped the cast and scripts slightly and aired the series in the 7.00 p.m. slot starting 20 January 1986. It initially attracted low audiences, however after a concerted publicity drive, Ten managed to transform the series into a major success, turning several of its actors into major international stars. The show's popularity eventually declined and it was moved to the 6.30 p.m. slot in 1992. As of 2015 the series airs on Eleven and is Australia's longest-running soap opera.\n\nThe success of Neighbours in the 1980s prompted the creation of somewhat similar suburban and family or teen-oriented soap operas such as Home and Away (1988–present) on Channel Seven and Richmond Hill (1988) on Channel Ten. Both proved popular, however Richmond Hill emerged as only a moderate success and was cancelled after one year to be replaced on Ten by E Street (1989–1993).\n\nNine continued trying to establish a successful new soap opera, without success. After the failure of family drama Family and Friends in 1990, it launched the raunchier and more extreme Chances in 1991, which resurrected the sex and melodrama of Number 96 and The Box in an attempt to attract attention. Chances achieved only moderate ratings, and was moved to a late-night timeslot. It underwent several revamps that removed much of the original cast, and refocused the storylines to incorporate science-fiction and fantasy elements. The series continued in a late night slot until 1992, when it was cancelled due to low ratings despite the much-discussed fantasy storylines.\n\nAustralian soaps internationally\n\nSeveral Australian soap operas have also found significant international success. In the UK, starting in the mid-1980s, daytime broadcasts of The Young Doctors, The Sullivans, Sons and Daughters and Neighbours (which itself was subsequently moved to an early-evening slot) achieved significant success. Grundy's Prisoner began airing in the United States in 1979 and achieved high ratings in many regions there, however the show ended its run in that country three years into its run. Prisoner also aired in late-night timeslots in the UK beginning in the late 1980s, achieving enduring cult success there. The show became so popular in that country that it prompted the creation of two stage plays and a stage musical based on the show, all of which toured the UK, among many other spin-offs. In the late 1990s, Channel 5 repeated Prisoner in the UK. Between 1998 and 2005, Channel 5 ran late-night repeats of Sons and Daughters. During the 1980s, the Australian attempts to emulate big-budget U.S. soap operas such as Dallas and Dynasty had resulted in the debuts of Taurus Rising and Return to Eden, two slick soap opera dramas with big budgets that were shot entirely on film. Though their middling Australian ratings resulted in the shows running only for a single season, both programs were successfully sold internationally.\n\nOther shows to achieve varying levels of international success include Richmond Hill, E Street, Paradise Beach (1993–1994), and Pacific Drive (1995–1997). Indeed, these last two series were designed specifically for international distribution. Channel Seven's Home and Away, a teen soap developed as a rival to Neighbours, has also achieved significant and enduring success on UK television.\n\nThe 1990s and beyond\n\nSomething in the Air, a serial examining a range of characters in a small country town ran on the ABC from 2000 to 2002.\n\nAttempts to replicate the success of daily teen-oriented serials Neighbours and Home and Away saw the creation of Echo Point (1995) and Breakers (1999) on Network Ten. These programs foregrounded youthful attractive casts and appealing locations but the programs were not long-running successes and Neighbours and Home and Away remained the most visible and consistently successful Australian soap operas in production. In their home country, they both attracted respectable although not spectacular ratings in the early 2000s. By 2004, Neighbours was regularly attracting just under a million viewers per episode  – considered at that time a low figure for Australian prime time television. By March 2007, the Australian audience for Neighbours had fallen to fewer than 700,000 a night. This prompted a revamp of the show's cast, its visual presentation, and a move away from the recently added action-oriented emphasis to refocus the show on the domestic storylines it is traditionally known for.  During this period Neighbours and Home and Away continued to achieve significant ratings in the UK. This and other lucrative overseas markets, along with Australian broadcasting laws that enforce a minimum amount of domestic drama production on commercial television networks, help ensure that both programs remain in production. Both shows get higher total ratings in the UK than in Australia (the UK has three times the total population of Australia) and the UK channels make a major contribution to the production costs.\n\nIt has been suggested that with their emphasis on the younger, attractive and charismatic characters, Neighbours and Home and Away have found success in the middle ground between glamorous, fantastic U.S. soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes and the more grim, naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older, unglamorous characters. The casts of Neighbours and Home and Away are predominantly younger and more attractive than the casts of UK soaps, and without excessive wealth and glamour of the U.S. daytime serial, a middle-ground in which they have found their lucrative niche.\n\nNeighbours was carried in the United States on the Oxygen cable channel in March 2004; however it attracted few viewers, perhaps in part due to its scheduling opposite well-established and highly popular U.S. soap operas such as All My Children and The Young and the Restless, and was dropped by the network shortly afterwards due to low ratings.\n\nheadLand made its debut on Channel Seven in November 2005, the series arose out of a proposed spinoff of Home and Away that was to have been produced in conjunction with Home and Aways UK broadcaster, Five. The idea for the spin-off was scuttled after Five pulled out of the deal, which meant that the show could potentially air on a rival channel in the UK; as such, Five requested that the new show be developed as a standalone series and not be spun off from a series that it owned a stake in. The series premiered in Australia on November 15, 2005, but was not a ratings success and was cancelled two months later on January 23, 2006. The series broadcast on E4 and Channel 4 in the UK.\n\nAfter losing the UK television rights to Neighbours to Five, the BBC commissioned a replacement serial Out of the Blue, which was produced in Australia. It debuted as part of BBC One's weekday afternoon schedule on 28 April 2008  but low ratings prompted its move to BBC Two on 19 May 2008.   The series was cancelled after its first season. \n\nNeighbours continued low ratings in Australia resulted in it being moved to Ten's new digital channel, Eleven on January 11, 2011.  However, it continues to achieve reasonable ratings on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, and as of March 2013 still reportedly achieved significant international sales. \n\nNew Zealand\n\nTelevision\n\nPioneering series [http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/pukemanu/series Pukemanu] aired over two years (1971–72) and was the NZBC's first continuing drama. It followed the goings-on of a North Island timber town. \nClose to Home is a New Zealand television soap opera which ran on Television One (Formally NZBC, later becoming Television New Zealand) from 1975 to 1983. At its peak in 1977 nearly one million viewers tuned in twice weekly to watch the series co-created by Michael Noonan and Tony Isaac (who had initially only agreed to make the show on the condition they would get to make The Governor).  Gloss is a television drama series that screened from 1987 to 1990. The series is about a fictional publishing empire run by the Redfern family. Gloss was NZ's answer to US soap Dynasty, with the Carrington oil scions replaced by the wealthy Redferns and their Auckland magazine empire. It was a starting point for many actors who went on to many productions in New Zealand, Australia and around the world including Temuera Morrison, Miranda Harcourt, Peter Elliott, Lisa Chappell, Danielle Cormack and Kevin Smith. Many of them would go on to star in Shortland Street which has been New Zealand's most popular soap since its debut in 1992. It airs on TVNZ 2.\n\nRadio\n\nRadio New Zealand began airing its first radio soap You Me Now in September 2010. It is available for podcast on its website.\n\nCanada\n\nRelatively few daily soap operas have been produced on English Canadian television, with most Canadian stations and networks that carry soap operas airing those imported from the United States or the United Kingdom. Notable daily soaps that did exist included Family Passions, Scarlett Hill, Strange Paradise, Metropia, Train 48 and the international co-production Foreign Affairs. Family Passions was an hour-long program, as is typical of American daytime soaps; all of the others ran half-hour episodes. Unlike American or British soap operas, the most influential of which have run for years or even decades, even daily Canadian soap operas have run for a few seasons at most. Short-run soaps, including 49th & Main and North/South, have also aired. Many of these were produced in an effort to comply with Canadian content regulations, which require a percentage of programming on Canadian television to originate from Canada.\n\nNotable prime time soap operas in Canada have included Riverdale, House of Pride, Paradise Falls, Lance et Compte (\"He Shoots, He Scores\"), Loving Friends and Perfect Couples and The City. The Degrassi franchise of youth dramas also incorporated some elements of the soap opera format.\n\nOn French-language television in Quebec, the téléroman has been a popular mainstay of network programming since the 1950s. Notable téléromans have included Rue des Pignons, Les Belles Histoires des pays d'en haut, Diva, La famille Plouffe, and the soap opera parody Le Cœur a ses raisons.\n\nIndia\n\nIndia has produced many soap operas. These started in the late 1980s, as more and more people began to purchase television sets. At the beginning of the 21st century, soap operas became an integral part of Indian culture. Indian soap operas mostly concentrate on the conflict between love and arranged marriages occurring in India, and many include conflicts between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. Indian serials are produced in the Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Kannada, Telugu, and Malayalam languages.\n\nMany soap operas produced in India are also broadcast overseas in the UK, Canada, the United States, and some parts of Europe, South Africa and Australia. They are often mass-produced under large production banners, with companies like Balaji Telefilms running different language versions of the same serial on different television networks or channels.\n\nEurope\n\nRemakes of Australian serials\n\nThe Australian serial The Restless Years was remade in the Netherlands as Goede tijden, slechte tijden (which debuted in 1990) and in Germany as Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten (which has aired since 1992): both titles translate to \"good times, bad times\". These remakes are still airing, but have long since diverged from the original Australian storylines. The two shows are the highest-rated soap operas in their respective countries.\n\nA later Australian serial, Sons and Daughters, has inspired five remakes produced under license from the original producers and based, initially, on original story and character outlines. These are Verbotene Liebe (Germany, 1995–present); Skilda världar (Sweden, 1996–2002); Apagorevmeni agapi (Greece, 1998); Cuori Rubati (Italy, 2002–2003) and Zabranjena ljubav (Croatia, 2004–2008). Both The Restless Years and Sons and Daughters were created and produced in Australia by the Reg Grundy Organisation.\n\nNorway\n\nThe Norwegian soap opera Hotel Cæsar has aired on TV 2 since 1998, and is the longest-running television drama in Scandinavia. Popular foreign soaps in the country include Days of Our Lives (broadcast on TV6), The Bold and the Beautiful (TNT) and Home and Away (TV 2), all of which are subtitled.\n\nNetherlands\n\nSerials have included Goede tijden, slechte tijden (1990–present), Onderweg naar Morgen (1994–2010) and Goudkust (1996–2001). U.S. daytime serials As The World Turns and The Bold and the Beautiful have aired in the Netherlands; As the World Turns began airing in the country in 1990, with Dutch subtitles.\n\nGermany\n\nIn the 1980s, German networks successfully added American daytime and primetime soap operas to their schedule before Das Erste introduced its first self-produced weekly soap with Lindenstraße, which was seen as a German counterpart to Coronation Street. Like in other countries, the soap opera met with negative reviews, but eventually proved critics wrong with nearly 13 million viewers tuning in each week. Even though the format proved successful, it was not until 1992 before Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten became the first German daily soap opera. Early ratings were bad as were the reviews, but the RTL network was willing to give its first soap opera a chance; ratings would improve, climbing to 7 million viewers by 2002. Not long after Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten, Das Erste introduced Marienhof, which aired twice a week.\n\nAfter successfully creating the first German daily soap, production company Grundy Ufa wanted to produce another soap for RTL. Like GZSZ, the format was based on an Australian soap opera from Reg Watson. But RTL did not like the plot idea about separated twins who meet each other for the first time after 20 years and fall in love without knowing that they are related. The project was then taken to Das Erste, which commissioned the program, titled Verbotene Liebe, which premiered on January 2, 1995. With the premiere of Verbotene Liebe, the network turned Marienhof into a daily soap as well. In the meanwhile, RTL debuted the Grundy Ufa-produced Unter uns in late 1994.\n\nZDF started a business venture with Canada and co-produced the short-lived series Family Passions, starring actors such as Gordon Thomson, Roscoe Born, Dietmar Schönherr and a young Hayden Christensen. The daytime serial premiered on December 5, 1994, lasting 130 episodes. After its cancellation, the network debuted Jede Menge Leben. Even after a crossover with three soaps, Freunde fürs Leben, Forsthaus Falkenau and Unser Lehrer Doktor Specht, the soap was canceled after 313 episodes. Sat.1 tried to get into the soap business as well, after successfully airing the Australian soap opera Neighbours, which was dropped in 1995 due to the talk show phenomenon which took over most of the daytime schedules of German networks. The network first tried to tell a family saga with So ist das Leben – die Wagenfelds, before failing with Geliebte Schwestern. RTL II made its own short-lived attempt with Alle zusammen - jeder für sich.\n\nThe teen soap opera Schloss Einstein debuted on September 4, 1998, focusing on the life of a group of teenagers at the fictional titular boarding school near Berlin. As of July 2014, the series has produced over 815 episodes during the course of 17 seasons, a milestone in German television programming, and was renewed for an 18th season to debut in 2015.\n\nIn 1999, after the lasting success of Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten, Marienhof, Unter uns and Verbotene Liebe, ProSieben aired Mallorca – Suche nach dem Paradies, set on the Spanish island with the same name. After nine months, the network canceled the program due to low viewership and high production costs. Even though ratings had improved, the show ended its run in a morning timeslot. The soap opera became something of a cult classic, as its 200-episode run was repeated several times on free-to-air and pay television.\n\nIn 2006, Alles was zählt became the last successful daily soap to make its debut, airing as a lead-in to Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten and also produced by Grundy Ufa. Since Germany started to produce its own telenovelas, all soap operas faced declines in ratings. Unter uns was in danger of cancellation in 2009, but escaped such a fate due to budget cuts imposed by the show's producers and the firing of original cast member Holger Franke, whose firing and the death of his character outraged fans, resulting in a ratings spike in early 2010. After Unter uns was saved, Das Erste planned to make changes to its soap lineup. Marienhof had to deal with multiple issues in its storytelling, as well as in producing a successful half-hour show. Several changes were made within months, however Marienhof was canceled in June 2011. Verbotene Liebe was in danger of being cancelled as well, but convinced the network to renew it with changes that it made in both 2010 and 2011; the soap was later expanded to 45 minutes after Marienhof was canceled, and the network tried to decide on whether to revamp its lineup.\n\nWhile Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten, Unter uns and Alles was zählt are currently the only daily soaps on the air after Verbotene Liebe has been cancelled and aired its last episode in June, 2015 due to low ratings, the telenovelas Sturm der Liebe and Rote Rosen are considered soaps by the press as well, thanks to the changing protagonists every season.\n\nBelgium\n\nIn Belgium, the two major soap operas are Thuis (\"Home\") and Familie (\"Family\"). Soap operas have been very popular in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. Familie debuted in late 1991, and with nearly 5,000 half-hour episodes, it has the highest episode total of any soap in Europe. The highest-rated soap opera is Thuis, which has aired on \"één\" since late 1995. Thuis is often one of the five most-watched Belgian shows and regularly garners over one million viewers (with 6.3 million Flemmings in total).\n\nDuring the 1990s, foreign soap operas such as Neighbours and The Bold and the Beautiful were extremely popular, the latter having achieved a cult status in Belgium and airing in the middle of the decade during prime time. Both soaps still air today, along with other foreign soaps such as Days of Our Lives, Australia's Home and Away and Germany's \"Sturm der Liebe\". Vitaya unsuccessful attempted to air the Dutch soap opera \"Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden\" in 2010. Other foreign soaps that previously aired on Belgian television include The Young and the Restless, EastEnders (both on VTM), \"Port Charles\" (at één, then known as TV1) and \"Coronation Street\" (on Vitaya). \"Santa Barbara\" aired during the 1990s on VTM for its entire run.\n\nThe only teen soap opera on Belgian television was Spring (\"Jump\" in English), which aired on the youth-oriented Ketnet and produced over 600 15-minute episodes from late 2002 until 2009, when it was cancelled after a steady decline in ratings following the departures of many of its original characters.\n\nItaly\n\nThe most successful soap opera in Italy is the evening series Un posto al sole (\"A Place Under the Sun\"), which had aired on Rai 3 since 1996 (whose format is based on the Australian soap opera Neighbours). Several other Italian soaps have been produced such as Ricominciare (\"Starting Over\"), Cuori rubati (\"Stolen Hearts\"), Vivere (\"Living\"), Sottocasa (\"Downstairs\"), Agrodolce (\"Bittersweet\") and Centovetrine (\"Hundred Shop Windows\").\n\nThe most popular Italian prime-time drama series, Incantesimo (\"Enchantment\"), which ran from 1998 to 2008, became a daytime soap opera for the final two years of its run, airing five days a week on Rai 1.\n\nIreland\n\nTelevision\n\nIn the early years of RTÉ, the network produced several dramas but had not come close to launching a long-running serial. RTÉ's first television soap was Tolka Row, which was set in urban Dublin. For several years, both Tolka Row and The Riordans were produced by RTÉ; however, the urban soap was soon dropped in favor of the more popular rural soap opera The Riordans, which premiered in 1965.  Executives from Yorkshire Television visited during on-location shoots for The Riordans in the early 1970s and in 1972, debuted Emmerdale Farm (now Emmerdale), based on the successful format of the Irish soap opera. In the late 1970s, The Riordans was controversially dropped. The creator of that series would then go on to produce the second of his \"Agri-soap\" trilogy Bracken, starring Gabriel Byrne, whose character had appeared in the last few seasons of The Riordans. Bracken was soon replaced by the third \"Agri-soap\" Glenroe, which ran until 2001. As RTÉ wanted a drama series for its Sunday night lineup rather than a soap opera, On Home Ground (2001–2002), The Clinic (2002–2009) and RAW (2010–2013) replaced the agri-soaps of the previous decades.\n\nIn 1989, RTÉ decided to produce its first Dublin-based soap opera since the 1960s. Fair City, which is set in the fictional city of Carrickstown, initially aired one night a week during the 1989-90 season, and similar to its rural soaps, much of the footage was filmed on location – in a suburb of Dublin City. In 1992, RTÉ made a major investment into the series by copying the houses used in the on-location shoots for an on-site set in RTÉ's Headquarters in Dublin 4. By the early 1990s, it was airing two nights a week for 35 weeks a year. With competition from the UK soap operas, RTÉ expanded Fair City to three nights a week for most of the year and one night a week during the summer in 1996, later expanding to four nights a week and two nights during the summer. Until the early 2000s, the series produced four episodes a week, airing all 52 weeks of the year. Fair City airs Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8.00 p.m. GMT on RTÉ One; however, after rival network TV3 moved Coronation Street to Thursday night, the Wednesday night episode of Fair City began airing at 7:30 p.m. each week.\n\nTG4 produce the Irish language soap Ros na Rún (\"Headland of the Secrets\" or \"Headland of the Sweethearts\"); set in the fictional village of Ros Na Rún, located outside Galway and near Spiddal, it centres on the domestic and professional lives of the town's residents. It is modeled on an average village in the West of Ireland, but with its own distinct personality – with a diverse population that share secrets, romances and friendships among other things. While the core community has remained the same, the look and feel of Ros Na Rún has changed and evolved over the years to incorporate the changing face of rural Ireland. It has an established a place not only in the hearts and minds of the Irish speaking public, but also the wider Irish audience. The program has dealt with many topics, including domestic violence, infidelity, theft, arson, abortion, homosexuality, adoption, murder, rape, drugs, teen pregnancy and paedophilia. It runs twice a week for 35 weeks of the year, currently airing Tuesday and Thursday nights. Ros na Rún is the single largest independent production commissioned in the history of Irish broadcasting. Prior to TG4's launch, it originally aired on RTÉ One in the early 1990s.\n\nAlthough Ireland has access to international soaps (such as Coronation Street, Emmerdale, EastEnders, Home and Away, Hollyoaks and Neighbours), Fair City continues to outperform them all, and is Ireland's most popular soap opera, with the show peaking at over 700,000 viewers.\n\nJanuary 2015 Red Rock has broadcast on TV3. Red Rock airs twice a week on Wednesday and Thursday nights. The series is base in a fishing village in Dublin. The soaps centres around the local Garda station but also includes stories from the village.\n\nRadio\n\nRTÉ Radio produced its first radio soap, Kennedys of Castleross, which ran from April 13, 1955 to 1975.  In 1979 RTÉ long running TV soap The Riordans moved to Radio until December 24, 1985.  In the mid-1980s, RTÉ debuted a new radio soap, Harbour Hotel, which ran until the mid-1990s. The network later ran two short-lived radio soaps, Konvenience Korner and Riverrun, which were followed in 2004 by Driftwood.  RTÉ does not run any radio soaps, however RTÉ Radio 1 continues to air radio dramas as part of its nighttime schedule. \n\nFrance\n\nFrance had no real tradition of running daytime dramas; however in 2004, the primetime soap Plus belle la vie premiered on public television network France 3. After initially suffering from poor ratings, the show became a huge success and is one of the highest-rated series on the network. Other attempts were made by competitors to create soaps (including Seconde Chance, Cinq soeurs and Paris 16ème), but none have achieved much success.\n\nGreece\n\nIn Greece, there have been several soap operas.\n\nANT1\n\nAn early serial was Sti skia tou hrimatos (\"Money Shadows\"), which ran from 1990 to 1991. September 1991 saw the debut of Lampsi (\"the Shining\"), from creator Nicos Foskolos. The series would become Greece's longest-running soap opera. After the success of Lampsi came the short lived To galazio diamandi (\"Blue Diamond\") and Simphonia siopis (\"Omertà\"). Lampsi was canceled in June 2005 due to declining ratings. It was replaced by Erotas (\"Love\"), a soap that ran from 2005 to 2008. After that series ended, ANT1 abandoned the soap opera genre and focused on comedy series and weekly dramas.\n\nGreece's second longest-running soap is Kalimera Zoi (\"Goodmorning Life\"), which ran from September 1993 until its cancellation in June 2006 due to low ratings.\n\nMEGA\n\nMega Channel began producing soap operas in 1990 with the prime time serial I Dipsa (\"The Thirst\"), which ran for 102 episodes. Other daytime soaps have included Paralliloi dromoi (1992–1994) and its successor Haravgi (\"Daylight\", 1994–1995), both of which were cancelled due to low viewership; as well as the serials Apagorevmeni Agapi (\"Forbidden Love\"), which ran from 1998 to 2006; Gia mia thesi ston Ilio (\"A Spot Under the Sun\"), which ran from 1998 to 2002; Filodoxies (\"Expectations\"), which ran  from 2002 to 2006; and Vera Sto Deksi (\"Ring on the Right Hand\"), which ran from 2004 to 2006 and proved to be a successful competitor to Lampsi, causing that show's ratings to decline.\n\nTa Mistika Tis Edem (\"Edem Secrets\"), which was created by the producers of Vera Sto Deksi, debuted in 2008 and has eclipsed that show's success. Its ratings place it consistently among the three highest-rated daytime programs.\n\nERT\n\nIENED (which was renamed ERT2 in 1982) was responsible for the first Greek soap operas I Kravgi Ton Likon and Megistanes. ERT also produced the long-running soap O Simvoleografos. Since 2000 and with the introduction of private television, ERT produced additional daily soap operas – which included Pathos (\"Passion\"), Erotika tis Edem (\"Loving in Eden\") and Ta ftera tou erota (\"The Wings of Love\") – however, these failed to achieve high ratings and were canceled shortly after their premiere.\n\nALPHA\n\nAlpha produced Kato apo tin Acropoli (\"Under the Acropolis\"), which ran for 2½ years.\n\nCyprus\n\nWeekday shows\n\nThe first daytime soap opera produced by a Cyprus channel was LOGOs TV's Odos Den Ksehno (\"'Don't Forget' Street\"), which ran from January to December 1996. It was followed by To Serial, which also ran for one year from September 1997 to June 1998. CyBC created the third weekdaily soap, Anemi Tou Pathous (\"Passion Winds\"), running from January 2000 to June 2004, which was replaced by I Platia (\"The Square\") from September 2004 to July 2006. Epikindini Zoni ran from 2009 to 2010, and was cancelled after 120 episodes. Vimata Stin Ammo made its debut in September 2010.\n\nSigma TV first commissioned the weekdaily comedic soap Sto Para Pente, which aired from September 1998 to June 2004, and first held the distinction of being the longest weekday show in Cyprus television history, before it was surpassed by Se Fonto Kokkino, which ran from September 2008 to July 2012. Other Sigma TV weekday shows include Akti Oniron (which ran from 1999 to 2001), Vourate Geitonoi (which ran from 2001 to 2005, and was the most successful weekdaily series, achieving ratings shares of up to 70% of all television households in the country), Oi Takkoi (which ran from 2002 to 2005), S' Agapo (which ran from 2001 to 2002), Vasiliki (which ran from 2005 to 2006), Vendetta (which ran from September 2005 to December 2006), 30 kai Kati (which ran from 2006 to 2007) and Mila Mou (which ran from September 2007 to January 2009).\n\nANT1 Cyprus aired the soap I Goitia Tis Amartias in 2002, which was soon canceled. Dikse Mou To Filo Sou followed from 2006 to 2009, along with Gia Tin Agapi Sou, which ran from 2008 to 2009 and itself was followed by Panselinos, which has aired since 2009.\n\nWeekly shows\n\nThe longest-running weekly show on Cyprus television is Istories Tou Horkou (\"Villages Stories\", which premiered on CyBC in March 1996 and ran until its cancellation in June 2006; it was revived in September 2010 but was cancelled again in March 2011 due to very low ratings), followed by Manolis Ke Katina (\"Manolis and Katina\", which ran from 1995 to 2004). The most controversial of these series was To Kafenio (\"The Coffee Shop\"), which premiered on CyBC on 1993 as a weekly series, before moving to MEGA Channel Cyprus six years later in 1999 as a weekdaily show and then moved to ANT1 Cyprus on 2000, which canceled the show one year later. There were plans to move the show back to CyBC as a weekly series in 2001, with the original cast, however this plan was never realised. The most successful weekly shows in Cyprus currently are ANT1's Eleni I Porni (\"Eleni, The Whore\"), which premiered in October 2010 and CyBC's Stin Akri Tu Paradisou (\"At The Heaven's Edge\"), which premiered in 2007. The most successful weekdaily soap was Aigia Fuxia, which aired on ANT1 Cyprus from 2008 to 2010.\n\nFinland\n\nThe only daily Finnish soap opera so far is Salatut elämät (Secret Lives), which has achieved popularity in Finland since its 1999 debut on MTV3. It focuses on the lives of people along the imaginary Pihlajakatu street in Helsinki. The show has also spawned several Internet spin-off series and a film based on the show that was released in 2012.\n\nOther soap-like shows in Finland are YLE shows Uusi päivä (which has aired since 2009) and Kotikatu (which ran from 1995 to 2012), however these programs do not adhere to a five-episode-a-week schedule.\n\nInternet and mobile soap opera\n\nWith the advent of internet television and mobile phones, several soap operas have also been produced specifically for these platforms, including EastEnders: E20, a spin-off of the established EastEnders. For those produced only for the mobile phone, episodes may generally consist of about six or seven pictures and accompanying text.\n\nOn September 13, 2011, TG4 launched a new 10-part online series titled, Na Rúin (an Internet spin-off of Ros na Rún). The miniseries took on the theme of a mystery; the viewer had to read Rachel and Lorcán's blogs as well as watch video diaries detailing each character's thoughts to solve the mystery of missing teenage character Ciara.\n\nParodies\n\nIn motion pictures, the 1982 comedy Tootsie has the lead character impersonating a woman in order to gain acting work on a long running television soap opera. Several scenes parody the production of soaps, their outrageous storylines and idiosyncratic stylistic elements.\n\nThe 1991 comedy Soapdish stars Sally Field as an aging soap opera actress on fictional series The Sun Also Sets who pines over her own neuroses and misfortunes such as her live-in boyfriend who leaves her to go back to his wife, and the incidents of backstabbing and scheming behind the scenes, some of which are more interesting than the stories on the program.\n\nOn television, several soap opera parodies have been produced:\n*The Carol Burnett Show (1967–78) featured a recurring skit, \"As the Stomach Turns\", that spoofed the American soap opera As the World Turns.\n* Two of the most famous U.S. parodies were the series Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman (1976–77) and Soap (1977–81), the latter of which was a weekly sitcom/soap opera parody.\n* Fresno was a 1986 American miniseries spoof of the primetime serials of the period.\n* The recurring \"Acorn Antiques\" skit on the UK's Victoria Wood As Seen On TV (1985–87) was modeled on Crossroads and other British soap operas of the 1970s.\n* Let The Blood Run Free (1990–94) was an Australian parody of medical drama series.\n* The 1990–91 ABC drama Twin Peaks was a primetime series that poked fun at the genre. Episodes during the series' first season also included a fictional soap within the stories, titled Invitation to Love.\n* Shark Bay (1996) was an Australian parody of glamorous beachside soap operas. It featured many actors who had appeared in Australian soap operas Sons and Daughters, Prisoner, Home and Away and Neighbours.\n* The 2000–2001 WB sitcom Grosse Pointe was a self-parody of creator Darren Star's behind-the-scenes experiences producing nighttime soaps, in particular Beverly Hills, 90210.\n* South African comedian Casper de Vries produced the soap opera parody Haak en Steek (which ran from 2003 to 2004), based on South African soaps like Egoli: Place of Gold.\n* The ABC dramedy Dirty Sexy Money (which ran from 2007 to 2009) was in a way a soap opera parody but, in actuality, was styled as more of a satire that operated in a humorous way similar to a parody. The series was critically acclaimed, but only lasted for two seasons.\n* The now-cancelled ABC soap opera One Life to Live would often poke fun at the genre as well, even featuring a soap within the soap called Fraternity Row, which many of One Life to Lives characters had either worked on or watched. Months after ABC announced in April 2011 that it would cancel One Life to Live, the series featured a storyline in which Fraternity Row itself was cancelled, leading the character of Roxy Balsom (Ilene Kristen) to desperately try and save the series, to no avail. A special episode that aired on December 19, 2011 featured the cast of One Life to Live acting out an episode of Fraternity Row in a dream of Roxy's; the episode poked fun at both  One Life to Live and the entire genre itself, featuring many soap opera stereotypes such as over-acting, outrageous story lines, bad casting and incestuous relationships; it also parodied some storylines featured on the real-world soap. The second-to-last episode of One Life to Live showed characters watching the final episode of Fraternity Row and exposing the show's last big secret: the series' main heroine and protagonist, Lorraine King Vonvaldenburg Baxter Beumont, was really a man.\n* Second City TV featured The Days of the Week: \"Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. These are...The Days of the Week.\"\n* The ABC comedy-drama Desperate Housewives (which ran from 2004 to 2012) was a semi-satirical nighttime series that took many elements from the genre.",
                "Calvin Valentine is a fictional character from the long-running Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Ricky Whittle. He arrived in July 2006 as a police officer with his mother and younger siblings and made his final appearance on 21 May 2010 after he was murdered by Theresa McQueen. Whittle was credited for a flashback episode on 1 December 2010. Calvin appeared again as a ghost to tell his wife Carmel that his daughter was fine where she was with her mother Theresa in February 2011.\n\nCasting\n\nIn May 2006, it was announced former Dream Team actor Ricky Whittle would arrive in Hollyoaks as \"mysterious\" Calvin Valentine.  Along with Whittle's casting, it was announced his former Dream Team co-star Jamie Lomas would take on the part of \"bad boy\" Warren Fox. Speaking of Lomas and Whittle's casting, a Hollyoaks spokesperson stated: \"We're delighted to welcome Ricky and Jamie to the Hollyoaks cast. Their characters are set to bring lots of drama to the show!\"\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Whittle had decided to leave the series after he quit to pursue other projects.  It was then announced that the character would be killed off.  Speaking of how he reached the decision to leave, Whittle stated: \"To be honest I was always looking to leave next year. It'll be four years next year when I eventually leave. Everyone has ambition. I could stay on this show for the rest of my life because I love it up here - it's a wicked little family and we're all really close. However, I don't want to spend all that time here for a big movie director or producer to come across to England when I'm in my 30s and say, 'If you'd come over when you were in your 20s, you'd've made it really big'. I'd rather go over to the States, go do the movie thing, the drama thing, or even fail - I'd rather go over and fail and have them say, 'You're not good enough, your accent's not right or your look's not right' - at least then I'd know and I'd have it out of my head. I always believe you regret the things you don't do. I don't want what-ifs hanging over me.\" \n\nCharacter development\n\nPersonality and identity\n\nCalvin first appeared as an honest, kind-hearted policeman. However, in 2008, the character of Calvin began to change, when his younger sister Sasha Valentine (Nathalie Emmanuel) began buying drugs from Nige Foster (Sam Townend), who Calvin ultimately ended up believing he had killed. Whittle, speaking to Digital Spy, said, \"He was at his lowest ebb. Everyone forgets that he's only 22 and he's had to look after his family. He's still just a kid himself and everything piles up on him. He just doesn't know what to do any more. Sasha was on the drugs and then she came off them. Calvin was making an extra effort with her and there was no reason for her to go back to them. He didn't understand why she went back to the drugs after all his efforts. When he caught her 'self-harming' — or what Calvin thought was self-harming — he didn't want her to go through the ordeal, so he went to get her drugs.\" \n\nCalvin then began dodgy dealings for Warren, including drugs. Whittle, speaking to Digital Spy, said, \"Calvin and Warren have always been these stags who have locked horns – good versus evil, battling for the two years we've been on the show together. Warren's going to start corrupting Calvin a little bit. Calvin's been on the moral side for two years and it's not really done anything for him. He's lost the girl, the baby, friends and family. Whereas Warren's been wheeling and dealing and he's got the girl, the club, the money, the car… Let's just say Warren leads Calvin astray a little and they're going to become allies.\"\n\nRelationships\n\nThe apparent love of Calvin's life was originally Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee). However, their engagement ended when he discovered her affair with his enemy Warren Fox. The second main love for Calvin was Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna). The characters quickly fell in love, became engaged and eventually married. In May 2008, series producer Bryan Kirkwood, speaking to Digital Spy about the couple's upcoming wedding, said: \"They're a fantastic couple to come up with stories for. They're engaged at the moment and it's nice to see the lighter side of Calvin. We'll have fun watching Carmel planning the wedding of the millennium and it'll continue to serve the fun war between the Valentines and McQueens.\"\n\nWhittle also discussed Calvin and Carmel's relationship and second wedding. He explained: \"Calvin's completely besotted with Carmel. She's the one he's always wanted - she's always been his true love since they first started seeing each other and everyone's always wanted them to get back together, which has been nice. I think it's a very good example of fan power. The producers weren't going to put these two together ever again because everyone wanted them together. It was a Ross and Rachel situation — they're meant to be [together], but something would always happen for it not to quite work out. I think Calvin and Carmel fans will be happy that they're back together in the episode — it'll just pull a few heartstrings when Calvin's shot at the end.\" \n\nMurder\n\nOf the flash forward episode in which Calvin is killed,  Whittle said: \"I was so honoured that they gave me a flash forward — that’s never been done before. So people knew months ago that Calvin was going to die. You want to do a story justice and when it’s your exit, you want it to be memorable.\" Whittle's final scenes involved his death scene of which he stated: \"Calvin was actually already dead, so it was more about the aftermath. I was just lying there while people were crying around me.\"\n\nIt was announced on 28 January 2011 that Calvin would appear to Carmel as a ghost in February 2011. His reappearance is to coincide with the revenge of Kyle Ryder (Neil Toon) on Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), Calvin's murderer. Teasing the surprise storyline, a Hollyoaks statement said: \"Calvin's spirit reignites Carmel's love for the man she lost and leads her to make some tough decisions about her future.\" However, Ricky Whittle will not return to the soap as the forthcoming scenes were filmed while he was still contracted with the show in 2010. Calvin returned for episodes from 14 February 2011. \n\nStorylines\n\nBackstory\n\nLiving with his mother and younger siblings, Calvin had to be the \"man of the house\" after his father Leo walked out on them when Sasha and Sonny were young. Over that time being the male role model, Calvin developed an over-protective personality which still shows presently. Unbeknownst to Calvin and his other siblings, Leo had been having an affair for years and had produced two more children, whom he went to stay with in the thirteen years before arriving in Hollyoaks.\n\n2006–2011\n\nCalvin arrives with his mother Diane (Pauline Black) and two younger siblings Sonny (Devon Anderson) and Sasha. Calvin begins his first day as a police officer and tragically discovers Diane has been killed in a hit and run. Calvin then has to break the news to Sonny and Sasha. Despite grieving, Calvin does his best to look after his siblings, however Leo Valentine (Brian Bovell), Calvin, Sonny and Sasha's father, arrives to take control of the family. Calvin does not want Leo to be back in their lives as he has caused heartache for his mother. Sam Owen (Louis Tamone) takes everyone, including Calvin, hostage at The Dog and threatens to blow it up. Calvin attempts to stop him by smashing a glass on his head, however this causes Sam to drop the lighter and The Dog blows up. Calvin saves trapped Jake Dean's (Kevin Sacre) life despite Jake being responsible for his mother's death.\n\nIn 2007, Calvin and Louise begin a relationship. After a heated dispute, and an eventual break-up, Louise sleeps with Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). Louise and Calvin resume their romance, however, and upon their reconciliation, she announces her pregnancy. Perceptive in knowing the baby could be Warren's, Clare Devine (Gemma Bissix) convinces Louise to have an abortion and tell Calvin she suffered a miscarriage. After Calvin uncovers Louise's betrayal, he dumps Louise. Calvin becomes a suspect with Warren, Sam \"OB\" O'Brien (Darren Jeffries), Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) and Louise for the attempted murder of Clare after his mobile phone is found at the scene of the crime. He is questioned but later released. In September 2007, Calvin unearths that he has two half-siblings, Danny (David Judge) and Lauren Valentine (Dominique Jackson), who are the children of Leo and Valerie Holden (Jacqueline Leonard), the woman whom he had an affair with. Calvin and Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna) become romantically linked and announce their engagement, soon after, despite having temporary break ups. Calvin catches Nige dealing drugs and, knowing he sells them to Sasha, takes the drugs and tells him to leave. However, Calvin's colleague, Eddie find the drugs and believes Calvin has an addiction. With Warren, Calvin accidentally kills Nige and is guilt-ridden. Carmel and Calvin marry, however before, Calvin goes to The Loft during a drugs raid and removes Warren's drugs for him. Meanwhile, Carmel is waiting to be wed. Calvin arrives late and apologises before tying the knot. After the honeymoon, Calvin decides he needs to reflect over his guilt of killing Nige and Carmel is angered upon his disappearance.\n\nWhen he returns, Calvin begins to deal drugs for Warren. Calvin agrees to take part in a raid on The Loft with Mark Gascoyne (Craig Russell). Not having time to warn Warren about the raid, Calvin goes along with Mark and two other men, whom he later discovers are not police officers and that the raid is unofficial. Mark gets Calvin to beat up Warren with a baseball bat, which he does. Calvin then calls for an ambulance. Calvin informs Carmel about the drug deals and Nige's death. Carmel then splits up with Calvin and moves back in with her family. Angry Calvin decides to get Warren to confess to Sean Kennedy's (Matthew Jay Lewis) murder. Calvin records the confession on a tape and is shocked when Warren also says he killed Louise on their wedding day. As Warren is arrested, Calvin discovers the recorder has not worked and that Warren is free. Warren begins a relationship with Sasha, much to Calvin's hatred. As Sasha turns her back on her family, Warren's life begins to shatter and he ends up hitting foster brother Spencer Gray (Darren John Langford), who then moves into the Valentines. Clare has returned and has taken Warren hostage in The Loft. Calvin walks in and finds them and decides to call the police, however he remembers how much hurt his family has been put through and leaves Warren's fate in Clare's hands. Warren then presumably dies and Calvin has to help save Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) and Justin Burton (Chris Fountain) from the flames.\n\nCalvin begins to struggle to get a job and also with money. Ash Roy (Junade Khan) offers Calvin money in an illegal fight with his brother Ravi Roy (Stephen Uppal). Calvin takes part in the fight but ends up losing. Spencer becomes more needy for Calvin, who gets a new job in security. Spencer wants to go bowling but Calvin has to work. Calvin then quits his job and says he could not handle looking after Spencer. Calvin and Spencer begin to rebuild The Loft together with the help of Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace). Spencer begins playing with a saw and is seen by Malachy, who panics and rushes down the stairs, cutting his arm in the process. Calvin then stops Spencer helping him due to his HIV as Malachy's wife Mercedes Fisher (Jennifer Metcalfe) arrives and helps Malachy, wondering why no one else is. Spencer begins to get out of hand, vandalising Drive 'n' Buy and attacking Mercedes. Calvin appears to be getting closer to Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh), who begins helping with Spencer. However, Calvin cannot cope and decides to put Spencer in a care home.\n\nSpencer regularly visits, and gives Calvin and Sasha jobs in The Loft when it reopens. However, Mercedes and Malachy tell the three they are taking legal action over Malachy's accident. Cheryl resolves the matter by making Spencer give Malachy and Mercedes bar jobs. When Calvin finds all of the local college students getting free alcohol from Spencer, he accuses Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge) of taking advantage, and eventually punches him. After Mercedes and Malachy's marriage hits a rocky patch, Calvin and Mercedes have a heart-to-heart. They both back off when Mercedes kisses him. Mercedes makes it clear she loves Malachy. However, the pair continue flirting as are clearly attracted to each other. Spencer witnesses Calvin and Mercedes about to kiss, but assumes it is due to the mistletoe. When Calvin and Mercedes are alone in The Loft office, they begin kissing and undressing. Malachy returns and walks in on them. Devastated, he leaves without notifying them. The next day, he pretends he did not see Mercedes and Calvin, who continue their affair. Not long after Malchy's brother Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy) catches them yet Malachy still refuses to confront the pair, hoping to cling on to Mercedes. After Cheryl and her fiancee Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) split up, Calvin shares a kiss with her.\n\nCalvin continues his affair with Mercedes until Carmel agrees to give their relationship another try. Mercedes is upset and jealous that Calvin has ended things with her and spots an opportunity for revenge when Carmel confides in her that Calvin left Warren to die. A shocked Mercedes rushes to tell Sasha, who is distraught and tells Calvin he is dead to her. Lauren and Sasha tell Leo that if he does not tell Calvin to leave they will, and Calvin is given no choice but to move into the McQueens. After an argument, Carmel realises how much Calvin means to her and proposes, to which he agrees. The pair begin their wedding plans, but Calvin has a one-night stand with Carmel's cousin Theresa. Calvin tells Sasha to tell the police that Lauren's boyfriend Gaz Bennett (Joel Goonan) attacked her in order to keep him away from Lauren. Calvin also angers Jake Dean by refusing to give him his job back. In the run up to the wedding, Calvin receives death threats from racist Des Townsend (Kris Deedigan). Mercedes lures Calvin to a hotel where she sleeps with him again and confesses she loves him. Because of the death threats he has been receiving, Calvin gets hold of a gun which is stolen by Lauren following an argument with Mercedes. Mercedes tells her sister Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) about the affair and Jacqui finds the gun at the Valentines' home and steals it. A number of other things happen to Calvin on his wedding day, including punching Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley) for his racial abuse, being confronted by Malachy about the affair, Spencer finding out he left Warren to die and Theresa telling him she's pregnant. Calvin is shocked to learn Theresa is pregnant, and tells her she must have an abortion. He tells Carmel that Theresa is pregnant, but does not admit to being the father. As he has his first dance with Carmel, an upset Theresa steals the gun from Jacqui's bag and shoots Calvin, and he dies from his injury.\n\nIn 2011, Whittle returned to play Calvin as a ghost for a one-off episode. Upon hearing that his daughter, Kathleen-Angel, may not survive, Carmel goes to the church to pray. It is there where she sees Calvin's ghost and he tells her that Kathleen-Angel will be safe. In 2011, Theresa told Ethan Scott that she killed Calvin, and in 2013 she confesses to Dodger Savage (Danny Mac) that she killed Calvin. In 2014, she was arrested for his murder. In 2015, Theresa was released from prison for Calvin's murder.\n\nReception\n\nRicky Whittle was nominated for 'Sexiest Male' in the 2007, 2008 and 2009 British Soap Awards    Whittle was also nominated for 'Sexiest Male' at the Inside Soap Awards in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Also in 2008, he and Gemma Merna (Carmel) were nominated for 'Best Couple'. In 2010, Calvin and Carmel's wedding was nominated for 'Best Wedding', losing to Syed Masood and Amira Shah of EastEnders.  The character was selected as one of the \"top 100 British soap characters\" by industry experts for a poll to be run by What's on TV, with readers able to vote for their favourite character to discover \"Who is Soap's greatest Legend?\" \n\nWhittle was also popular within the show's cast. After the announcement of his departure, Whittle's co-star Bronagh Waugh (who plays Cheryl Brady) said: \"His was one of the first characters I came into contact with — I'll miss him greatly. Ricky's quite similar to me. He's a bundle of energy and positivity. We bounce around the building and have fun and joke, and we like the same music. I really will miss him but understand why he wants to go. He's had a fabulous couple of years. He's done everything he can do and it's time to move on. He's proved he's got so many skills and things to offer.\" \n\nRuth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture has criticised Calvin on different instances, once stating: \"Currently topping the ‘which Hollyoaks character is the worst’ poll on the forums at the moment, Calvin may look nice with his shirt off, but his misogynistic, patronising, whiney attitude is doing him no favours at all. It’s even making people sympathise a bit with Carmel, and we all know she’s a no good dirty boob-thief.\"  Deller later criticised him again, writing: \"Calvin Valentine, Hollyoaks, Last month’s winner (or loser, I suppose) continues to annoy, behave implausibly and maintain his self-righteous prickness, and was only usurped for a very good reason…\" \n\nIn her book Soap Stars, Debbie Foy features Whittle in one of her profile features and describes Calvin as the following: \"Calvin has been fiercely protective of the family. Calvin is a likable character, witty and intelligent, who wants to do the right thing.\"  Virgin Media compiled a list of their sexiest soap couples, Calvin and Carmel were featured and they stated: \"Couples don’t come much cuter than these two – they even have matching police uniforms! The Valentines may be a little lacking in the brain cell department, but they more than make up for it by being the biggest-hearted couple in soap.\""

                "Get Shorty is a 1995 American crime thriller comedy film based on Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and starring John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, and Danny DeVito, the plot remained true to the book except for a few minor details.\n\nA sequel, titled Be Cool, was released in 2005.\n\nPlot\n\nChili Palmer, a loan shark based in Miami, clashes with mobster, Ray \"Bones\" Barbone over a leather jacket borrowed from Palmer at a restaurant without permission by Mr. Barbone. They have two confrontations, the first of which leaves Barbone with a broken nose. Barbone then wants his boss Jimmy Capp to go after Palmer, but he refuses, as Palmer has done nothing wrong. Barbone took the jacket without permission, and Chili's car keys were in the jacket. Jimmy also tells Bones that Chili works for another mafioso named Momo and Capp has no power over him. But soon after Palmer's boss, Momo, dies of a heart attack, Chili finds himself working for Barbone, whose first order is for Palmer to collect a loan shark debt owed by dry cleaner Leo Devoe. Devoe was believed to have been killed in a commercial airliner crash, but in truth had actually gotten off the plane, and failed to re-board because he was getting drunk in the airport bar. After the plane crash, Devoe's wife, Faye, identified his personal effects, and the airline quickly offers her an insurance check for $300,000.  Faye gives Leo the insurance money, and he heads out of Miami. When Chili visits Leo's \"widow\" Faye, she reveals to Palmer that Leo is still alive, has left Miami, and is partying and winning money in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nWhile in Las Vegas, looking for Leo, Palmer also picks up a debt collection job from a casino manager to collect a marker debt from a B-movie producer/director named Harry Zimm. Palmer goes to Los Angeles and locates Zimm sleeping at the home of actress Karen Flores. After breaking into her house, Chili turns on the television, and waits for Zimm to come downstairs. At first scared of Chili, Zimm soon agrees to pay the casino the money he owes in 90 days. Film fan Palmer then pitches a movie idea: a thinly veiled story of his own life, being a shylock, including the airline insurance scam by Leo.\n\nZimm is very interested, but he has pressing financial problems: He owes $200,000 to limo company owner/drug dealer Bo Catlett, who also wants to be \"high up\" in the movie business. Chili Palmer says he will help Zimm take care of the money problem with Bo, and will stall Bo on the making of a Zimm movie called \"Freaks\". Arriving at Harry's movie office, Catlett is with his drug dealing sidekick Ronnie. They are visiting Zimm's office for a progress report about the Zimm film they are financing, titled \"Freaks\". Waiting for them with Harry is Palmer. Harry Zimm tells Catlett that Zimm has a different project, other than \"Freaks\", one he cannot talk about, to finish up first. Chili takes over the meeting, explaining that Bo and Ronnie must wait for Harry's other project to be finished first. Bo and Ronnie get angry, and Harry suddenly panics. Being afraid of Bo and Ronnie, to Chili's disgust Harry reveals the new Zimm movie project is a book by Murray Saffron, called \"Mr. Lovejoy\". Catlett and his partner Ronnie then proceed to threaten Zimm, saying they want their money back, or to put their money into \"Mr. Lovejoy\" instead of \"Freaks\".\n\nAfterward, Bo Catlett meets Colombian drug runner Yayo Portillo at the airport for a big cocaine transfer deal, and tells Yayo that he has to pick up the cocaine money from a locker at the airport. Yayo is upset at this deal change. Portillo is aware that the locker is under surveillance by the DEA, and Yayo refuses to get the money. Bo's bodyguard Bear, with his daughter, picks up his cocaine suitcase at the luggage claim. Bo with his partner Ronnie and Bear leave with the cocaine. Two days later Yayo confronts Bo at his house in the Hollywood hills and demands his money - and in frustration Bo shoots him dead.\n\nLater that day Palmer returns to Karen's house, where he asks Karen on a date. Karen is the ex-wife of actor Martin Weir, which gives Palmer the idea that Weir should star in his movie. Karen cannot go out, but later shows up at the end of the movie Chili has suggested they see - \"Touch of Evil\", with Orson Welles.  The next day Chili and Karen go to Martin Weir's home to pitch the script, with Chili giving the actor tips on how to act exactly like a loan shark.  Weir is intrigued with Chili and Karen's script idea.\n\nZimm has a lunch meeting with Chili and Karen, but Catlett and Bear suddenly show up and offer to invest the $500,000 that is still in a locker at the airport, which is the money owed to the drug cartel that didn't get picked up by Yayo.  Zimm agrees to sideline Chili's project just as Chili and Karen arrive for their lunch with Harry at the restaurant.  Bear confronts Chili, who throws Bear down the stairs and then threatens Catlett.  Zimm tells Chili and Karen about the money, and asks Chili to pick it up but Chili recognizes that it is a setup by Catlett and that there is a high probability that the money is being watched. Chili goes to the airport and creates a ruse that reveals that the DEA is looking for someone that will be trying to get the locker money, and  Chili leaves without being connected with the cash.\n\nAfter an evening office tryst with Doris, Murray Saffron's widow, a drunken Zimm makes a call to Barbone in Miami, telling him Chili has recovered the money from Leo Devoe and insults Barbone by speaking to him rudely on the phone. Barbone promptly flies to Los Angeles, confronts Zimm in his office, and beats him mercilessly when Zimm does not reveal the location of Chili and the money. Drug dealer Ronnie walks in, confronts Barbone, and Barbone suddenly shoots him, then puts the gun in Zimm's hand.\n\nDoris, Zimm's girlfriend, whose late husband wrote \"Mr. Lovejoy\", calls Karen and tells her that Zimm is in the hospital. When he is eventually released, Zimm must wear a neck brace and remains in agonizing pain, even as he endures Weir's arrogant behavior in a brief lunch meeting with Chili and Karen about their movie project.\n\nDesperate for money after double crossing Colombian cartel boss Escobar, Catlett kidnaps Karen and demands the money that Chili has gotten back from Devoe. But after Chili gives him the money, Catlett reneges on their deal. Chili cuts a deal with Bear to double-cross Catlett. On a balcony at Catlett's home, where Karen is being held, Bear pretends to give Chili a beating, but it's a set-up. In the struggle, Catlett is pushed over a balcony rail that was previously loosened by Bear and falls to his death.\n\nAt his hotel, Barbone confronts Palmer, demanding the money. Barbone finds the airport locker key, questions Chili, and assumes the money is hidden in the locker. At the prospect of acquiring DeVoe's insurance money without further incident, he expresses to Palmer a desire to bury the hatchet and forget all past transgressions. Barbone heads to the airport and approaches the locker as the DEA agents alert one another and appear ready to move. Suddenly, we hear actor Martin Weir confront Barbone from off-camera. Barbone turns around, and he is now being played by actor Harvey Keitel. Barbone fires at Weir, who attempts to fire back, but the movie gun malfunctions and ejects the magazine. The director, Penny Marshall, yells \"cut\", and we recognize that the scene is now a MGM Hollywood set.  As the movie set wraps for the day, we see Zimm is executive producer (accompanied by widow Doris Saffron nagging him), Chili and Karen as co-producers, and Bear as a special effects technical consultant.\n\nCast\n\n* John Travolta as Chili Palmer\n* Gene Hackman as Harry Zimm\n* Rene Russo as Karen Flores\n* Danny DeVito as Martin Weir\n* Dennis Farina as Ray \"Bones\" Barbone\n* Bette Midler as Doris Saffrin\n* Delroy Lindo as Bo Catlett\n* James Gandolfini as Bear\n* Jon Gries as Ronald \"Ronnie\" Wingate\n* Renee Props as Nicki\n* David Paymer as Leo Devoe\n* Martin Ferrero as Tommy Carlo\n* Miguel Sandoval as Mr. Escobar\n* Jacob Vargas as Yayo Portillo\n* Bobby Slayton as Dick Allen\n* Linda Hart as Fay Devoe\n* Ralph Manza as Fred the Barber\n\n;Cameos\n* Harvey Keitel as himself\n* Penny Marshall as herself\n* Barry Sonnenfeld as the Beefeater doorman\n* Alex Rocco appears as the gangster Jimmy Capp\n\nProduction\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Ray Bones has two thugs with him; one of them is played by actor Ernest \"Chili\" Palmer.

                "Get Shorty is a 1990 novel by American novelist Elmore Leonard. In 1995, the novel was adapted into a film of the same name.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe book'      s story centers on Ernest \"Chili\" Palmer, a small-time shylock (or loanshark) based in Miami. After a run-in with mobster Ray \"Bones\" Barbone over a stolen coat, Chili is sent after Leo Devoe, who has scammed an airline out of $300,000 in life insurance by faking his own death. Leo had been aboard a plane whose flight was delayed, prompting him to disembark and go drinking in the airport bar. Leo misses the plane's takeoff, and when it crashes, his \"widow\" receives a check for $300,000, money which Leo takes to Las Vegas.\n\nAfter relieving Leo of the money in Vegas, Chili finds a more interesting assignment: the casino is looking to collect from Harry Zimm, a horror film producer based in Los Angeles. Chili, himself very interested in the movie business, heads for L.A. to make Harry pay.\n\nChili lets his love of movies overshadow his collection job. He sneaks into the house of actress Karen Flores in the middle of the night, startling both Harry and Karen, who are together in bed. After he warns Harry to pay his Las Vegas markers, he explains that he has an idea for a movie. Harry is immediately taken in by Chili's charm and his movie premise, whereas Karen is still skeptical.\n\nChili recounts Leo's story to Harry in the third person, as if it were a work of fiction. Karen is on to him, pointing out that the story clearly isn't fictional because she saw the plane crash in the news, realizing Chili is obviously the shylock in Chili's movie idea.\n\nThe next morning, Harry asks for Chili's help in dealing with a script he wants to buy. Harry tells him this script, Mr. Lovejoy, could be Academy Award worthy material. \"It'll be my Driving Miss Daisy,\" Harry assures Chili. There are, however, two problems: Harry does not own the script, his writer's widow Doris Saffron does, and she wants $500,000 for it; and he guaranteed a $200,000 investment from Bo Catlett, a local limo driver and drug dealer, to make another movie called Freaks. (Harry gambled Bo's $200,000 away in Vegas in hopes of making the $500,000 he needed for Mr. Lovejoy). In a meeting with Bo and his sidekick Ronnie Wingate, Harry and Chili tell them that, while their investment in Freaks is sound, they are making another movie first. Bo tells them to move the money into this new picture; Harry says he cannot, as the new movie deal is \"structured.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bo is involved in a Mexican drug deal which doesn't go through. He has left the payment in a locker at the L.A. airport, but the Colombian sent to receive the money, Yayo Portillo (whom Bo refers to as 'Yahoo'), does not feel safe unlocking the locker with so many DEA agents staked out nearby. Bo later meets Yayo at the limo garage, and after Yayo threatens to tell the DEA who Bo is, Bo shoots him.\n\nBo soon offers the locker money to Harry as an investment, telling him to send Chili to get the money. Chili senses something wrong, signs out a nearby locker as a test, and is taken for questioning by drug officials when he opens his own locker.\n\nChili and Karen are meanwhile seeking the interests of Martin Weir, a top-tier 3-time Oscar-nominated Hollywood actor to whom Karen was once married, to play the lead in Harry's film.\n\nThe loose ends are tied up when Ray comes to Los Angeles looking for the money Chili collected from Leo, only to find the key to the locker from the failed drug deal in one of Chili's pockets. Thinking Chili has stashed his cash in a locker, he goes to the airport and is busted by drug officials. In a final showdown with Bo, Bo is double-crossed by his partner, Bear.\n\nThe novel ends with Harry, Chili, and Karen having finished a production meeting, and wondering why writing the ending of a story is always the hardest part.\n\nTV series\n\nIn 2016, Epix announced that a Get Shorty TV series was ordered. \n\nNotes"

                "Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear is a 1889 self-portrait by Dutch, Post-Impressionist  artist Vincent van Gogh. \n\nDescription \n\nIn this self portrait, Van Gogh is shown wearing a blue cap with black fur and a green overcoat, with a bandage covering his ear and extending under his chin. He is in a traditional three-quarter view, and his forward gaze falls slightly to the right, out of the frame. Behind him is an open window, assumedly letting in a winter breeze, a canvas on an easel, with a few indistinguishable marks, as well as a Japanese woodblock print. This woodblock print has been identified as a Geishas in a Landscape published by Sato Tokyo. This shows an important influence of Japonism and wood block print on Van Gogh’s work, which also appear in the background of other portraits he had created. The painting is composed of impasto strokes, mostly in a vertical pattern. This creates a texture, which comes up off the canvas and adds dimension to the flat surface. The skin tone is muted with green and yellowish tones. The bandage covering Van Gogh’s ear in this painting alludes to his most famous conflict. Van Gogh used a mirror for his self portraits which is why some mistakenly think that he lost part of his right ear instead of his left.\n\nThe story \n\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in hopes of creating a community for artists to exist in mutual supportiveness and encouragement. He invited Paul Gauguin, an artist whom he had befriended in Paris, to come stay with him. They proved to be a disagreeable pair and quarreled often, sometimes violently. The evening of December 23, 1888 during one of their arguments, Van Gogh had a seizure during which he threatened Gauguin with a razor, but then injured himself, severing part of his left ear. In a state of excitement, he then brought the dismembered lobe to the Maison de Tolérance bordello where he presented it to a prostitute named Rachel. When Gauguin returned the following morning he discovered that the police had arrived at the house, and blood was splattered in every room. Van Gogh had severed an artery in his neck, and was in grave health after losing so much blood. He was removed to the hospital, and he confessed to having no recollection of what happened during this fit. Throughout his life, Van Gogh continued to suffer from similar fits, sometimes characterized by acute paranoia. \n\nAcquisition History\n\nAt the time of Van Gogh’s death, this painting was in the possession of Père Tanguy, although it was unclear how he had obtained it. Tanguy had posed twice for Van Gogh in 1887. It was exhibited in Paris 1901 and 1905 in a major Van Gogh retrospective. In 1928 Samuel Courtauld purchased it.  It is currently located in The Courtauld Gallery in London, UK. \n\nSome critics dismiss this painting as a fake or crude pastiche. However, if this were true it would have been painted at a moment in the 1890s when it wouldn’t have been profitable, as the artist would have died only a few ears earlier and had only sold a handful of works in his lifetime. By January 17, 1889 Vincent had written to his brother Theo mentioning he had completed “another new self portrait.” Confusion has arisen over whether this was in reference to Self Portrait with Bandaged Ear, or Self Portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe.   In each of these portraits Van Gogh is wearing the same clothing and sitting in the same pose, although the color schemes, props and locations are different. The Self Portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe has become more widely accepted in academia as one of Van Gogh’s authentic paintings.",
                "Vincent Willem van Gogh (; 30 March 1853 - 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter whose work had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. He was highly prolific and often completed more than one painting per day. In just over a decade he created approximately 2100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by symbolic colours and dramatic, impulsive, highly expressive paintwork. He sold only one painting during his lifetime and was largely unnoticed by critics until his suicide, aged 37, which followed years of poverty and mental illness.\n\nBorn into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh was thoughtful and intellectual as a child, but showed signs of mental instability. He worked as an art dealer as a young man, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, spending time as a missionary in southern Belgium, and later drifting in ill-health and solitude. He was keenly aware of modernist trends in art, and after moving back home with his parents, took up painting in 1881 with the financial support of his younger brother Theo, who kept up a long correspondence of letters with him. Many of his early works depict common and peasant labourers, and contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his mature period when he broadened his subject matter to include olive trees, cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers. In 1886 he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. From then his paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in 1888. There he lived in the \"Yellow House\", and with the French artist Paul Gauguin developed a concept of colour that symbolised inner emotion.\n\nVan Gogh suffered from continued psychotic episodes and delusions, an though he worried about his mental stability he often neglected his physical health, not eating and drinking heavily. His friendship with Gauguin came to an end after a violent encounter when he threatened the Frenchman with a razor, and in a rage, cut off part of his own right ear. While in a psychiatric hospital in Saint-Rémy his condition stabilised, leading to one of the more productive periods of his life. He moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise under the care of the homeopathic doctor and artist, Paul Gachet. While there, Theo wrote that he could no longer support him financially. A few weeks later, on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh walked into a wheat field and shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died from his injuries two days later.\n\nConsidered a madman and a failure in his lifetime, Van Gogh exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist \"where discourses on madness and creativity converge.\" His widespread critical, commercial and popular success began after his adoption by the early 20th-century Fauves and German Expressionists. His reputation continued to grow steadily and today he is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. Art historians typically view him as an exceptionally talented and influential artist whose mental instability inhibited and frustrated his artistic progression.\n\nLetters\n\nThe most comprehensive primary source for understanding Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother. Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support, and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene. The first letter, from Vincent to Theo, was written in August 1872 while Theo was still at school, and they continued to correspond throughout their lives.\n\nTheir lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged between 1872 and 1890. Vincent's letters are eloquent and expressive, have been described as having a \"diary-like intimacy\", and in parts read like autobiography. The art historian and translator of the letters, Arnold Pomerans, wrote that \"the publication of these letters added a fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh's artistic achievement, an understanding granted us by virtually no other painter.\" Theo saved all of Vincent's letters, and his widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger had some of them published in 1906 and 1913; the majority were published in 1914.\n\nThere are more than 600 letters from Vincent to Theo, and 40 from Theo to Vincent. In addition there are 22 to his sister Wil, 58 to the painter Anthon van Rappard, 22 to Émile Bernard, and individual letters to Paul Signac, Paul Gauguin and the critic Albert Aurier. Some are annotated with sketches. Many are undated, but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order. Problems in transcription and dating remain, mainly with those from Arles. While there, Vincent wrote around 200 letters, in Dutch, French and English. The period when he lived in Paris is the most difficult to put together because the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond.\n\nLife\n\nEarly years\n\nVincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), received a degree in theology at the University of Leiden in 1811, and had six sons, three of whom became art dealers. His grandfather may have been named after his own father's uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).\n\nHis mother came from a prosperous family in The Hague, and his father was the youngest son of a minister. The two met when Anna's younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus's older brother Vincent (Cent). Van Gogh's parents married in May 1851 and moved to Zundert. His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor, and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and Willemina (known as \"Wil\"). In later life Van Gogh remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo. Van Gogh's mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasised the importance of family to the point of claustrophobia for those around her, according to the Van Gogh biographers Naifeh and Smith. Although Theodorus's salary was modest, the Church supplied the family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse, and Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family's high social position.\n\nVan Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child. He was taught at home by Anna and a governess, and in 1860 was sent to the village school. In 1864 he was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen, where he felt abandoned, and campaigned to come home. In 1866 he moved to the middle school in Tilburg, where he was deeply unhappy. Van Gogh's interest in art began at a young age; his early drawings are expressive, but do not approach the intensity developed in his later work. Constantijn C. Huysmans, a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van Gogh's profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect. In March 1868, Van Gogh abruptly returned home. Later he wrote that his youth was \"austere and cold, and sterile.\"\n\nIn July 1869, Van Gogh's uncle Cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training  in 1873, Van Gogh was transferred to Goupil's London branch, at 17 Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of his life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. Van Gogh grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris, where he became difficult and resentful of issues such as the degree to which the firm commodified art, and was eventually dismissed.\n\nVan Gogh returned to England, taking unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate. When the proprietor moved to Isleworth, Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a Methodist minister's assistant. His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten; in 1876 he returned home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French and German. He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic. According to his room-mate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.\n\nTo support Van Gogh's religious convictions and his desire to become a pastor, in 1877 the family sent him to stay with an uncle in Amsterdam to study theology. Van Gogh prepared for the entrance examination with his uncle Johannes Stricker, a respected theologian. He failed the exam, and left his uncle Jan's house in July 1878. He undertook, but also failed, a three-month course at the Vlaamsche Opleidingsschool, a Protestant missionary school in Laeken, near Brussels.\n\nIn January 1879, Van Gogh took a post as a missionary at Petit-Wasmes in the coal-mining district of Borinage in Belgium.  To show support for his impoverished congregation, he gave up his comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person, and moved to a small hut where he slept on straw. His squalid living conditions did not endear him to church authorities, who dismissed him for \"undermining the dignity of the priesthood\". He then walked the 75 km to Brussels, returned briefly to Cuesmes in the Borinage, but gave in to pressure from his parents to return home to Etten. He stayed there until around March 1880, which caused concern and frustration for his parents. There was particular conflict between Van Gogh and his father, who considered committing him to the lunatic asylum at Geel.\n\nReturning to Cuesmes that August, he lodged with a miner until October. He became interested in the people and scenes around him, and recorded them in drawings after Theo's suggestion that he take up art in earnest. He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective.\n\nEtten, Drenthe and The Hague\n\nVan Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with his parents. He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Kee Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother's older sister Willamina and Johannes Stricker, arrived for a visit. He was thrilled and took long walks with her that summer. Kee was seven years older than Van Gogh, and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh surprised everyone by declaring to her his love, and proposing marriage. She refused with the words \"No, nay, never\" (\"nooit, neen, nimmer\").\n\nAfter Kee returned to Amsterdam, Van Gogh went to The Hague to sell paintings and to meet with his cousin, Anton Mauve. Van Gogh wanted to apprentice himself to Mauve who was successful and was, according to Naifeh and Smith, \"the artist Vincent wanted to be\". Mauve invited Van Gogh to return in a few months, and suggested he spend the intervening time working in charcoal and pastels; Van Gogh went back to Etten and followed that advice.\n\nLate in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote a letter to Johannes Stricker, which he described to Theo as an attack, and sent it by registered post to ensure its arrival. Within days he left for Amsterdam. Kee would not meet him, and her parents wrote that his \"persistence is disgusting.\" In desperation, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: \"Let me see her for as long as I can keep my hand in the flame.\" He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle blew out the flame. Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.\n\nFrom Amsterdam, Van Gogh went to The Hague and asked Mauve to take him on as a student. Mauve introduced him to watercolours, which Van Gogh worked on for the next month before going home for Christmas. That Christmas he refused to attend church, quarrelling with his father as a result, and left the same day for The Hague.  In January 1882, Mauve introduced him to painting in oil and lent him money to set up a studio. Within a month they fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. Van Gogh could only afford to hire people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oil, using money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the oils liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he was surprised at how good the results were.\n\nBy March 1882, Mauve appears to have suddenly gone cold towards Van Gogh, and stopped replying to his letters.  He had learned of Van Gogh's new domestic arrangement with an alcoholic prostitute, Clasina Maria \"Sien\" Hoornik (1850–1904), and her young daughter. He had met Sien towards the end of January 1882, when she had a five-year-old daughter and was pregnant. She had previously borne two children who died, but Van Gogh was unaware of this; on 2 July, she gave birth to a baby boy, Willem. When Van Gogh's father discovered the details of their relationship, he put pressure on his son to abandon Sien and her two children. Vincent at first defied him, and considered moving the family out of the city, but in late 1883 he left Sien and the children. Perhaps lack of money pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh may have felt family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her daughter to her mother, and baby Willem to her brother. Willem remembered visiting Rotterdam when he was about 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry in order to legitimise the child. He believed Van Gogh was his father, but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely. In 1904, Sien drowned herself in the River Scheldt.\n\nIn September 1883, Van Gogh moved to Drenthe in the northern Netherlands. In December, driven by loneliness, he went to stay with his parents, who had been posted to Nuenen, North Brabant.\n\nEmerging artist\n\nNuenen and Antwerp (1883–86)\n\nIn Nuenen, Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing. He completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages, working outside and very quickly. In August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter and ten years his senior, began joining him on his painting forays; she fell in love, and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They decided to marry, but the idea was opposed by both families, following which Margot took an overdose of strychnine. She was saved when Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.\n\nVan Gogh painted several groups of still lifes in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of the vivid colouration that distinguishes his later work.\n\nThere was interest from collectors in Paris, and Theo asked Vincent whether he had paintings ready to exhibit. In May 1885, Van Gogh completed his first major work, The Potato Eaters, and the series of \"peasant character studies\"; the culmination of several years of work. When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris, his brother responded that the paintings were too dark, and were not in keeping with the current bright style of Impressionism. August saw the first public exhibition of his work, in the shop windows of the paint dealer Leurs in The Hague. After one of his young peasant sitters became pregnant in September 1885, Van Gogh was accused of forcing himself upon her, and the village priest forbade parishioners to model for him.\n\nIn November 1885 Van Gogh moved to Antwerp, where he rented a small room above a paint dealer's shop in the rue des Images (Lange Beeldekensstraat). He lived in poverty and ate poorly, preferring to spend the money Theo sent on painting materials and models. Bread, coffee and tobacco were his staple intake. In February 1886, he wrote to Theo saying that he could only remember eating six hot meals since the previous May. His teeth became loose and painful. In Antwerp he applied himself to the study of colour theory and spent time in museumsparticularly studying the work of Peter Paul Rubensand broadened his palette to include carmine, cobalt blue and emerald green. Van Gogh bought Japanese ukiyo-e woodcuts in the docklands, later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings.\n\nVan Gogh had begun to drink heavily again, especially absinthe. He was treated by Amadeus Cavenaile in February and March 1886, possibly for syphilis; he recorded the treatment of alum irrigation and sitz baths in one of his notebooks. Despite his rejection of academic teaching, he took the higher-level admission exams at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, and in January 1886 matriculated in painting and drawing. For most of February, he was ill and run down by overwork, a poor diet and excessive smoking.\n\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - Worn Out (F997).jpg|Worn Out, pencil on watercolour paper, 1882.

Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam|alt=A human skull, bare bones of a neck and shoulders. The skull has a lit cigarette between its teeth.\n\nParis (1886–88)\n\nVan Gogh moved to Paris in March 1886, beginning a series of moves that the art historian Melissa McQuillan believes also reflects later changes \"in style, his reorientation of his enterprise [which] might be linked\". She believes that \"moving on became a way of avoiding conflict,\" and a coping mechanism for when the highly idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.\n\nIn Paris he shared Theo's rue Laval apartment in Montmartre, and studied at Fernand Cormon's studio. In June, they took a larger flat at 54 rue Lepic. In Paris, he painted portraits of friends and acquaintances, still life paintings, views of Le Moulin de la Galette, scenes in Montmartre, Asnières, and along the Seine. In 1885 in Antwerp he had become interested in Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints and had used them to decorate the walls of his studio; while in Paris he collected hundreds of them. He tried his hand at Japonaiserie, tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine Paris Illustre,  The Courtesan or Oiran (after Kesai Eisen) (1887), which he then graphically enlarged in the painting.\n\nAfter seeing the portrait of Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli at the Galerie Delareybarette, Van Gogh adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, particularly in paintings such as his Seascape at Saintes-Maries (1888). Two years later, Vincent and Theo paid for the publication of a book on Monticelli paintings, and Vincent bought some of his works to add to his collection.\n\nVan Gogh learned about Fernand Cormon's atelier from Theo.  Van Gogh worked at the studio in April and May 1886, where he frequented the circle of the Australian artist John Peter Russell, and met fellow students Émile Bernard, Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec – who painted a portrait of Van Gogh with pastel. The group congregated at Julien \"Père\" Tanguy's paint shop (which was, at that time, the only place where Paul Cézanne's paintings were displayed). He had easy access to Impressionist works in Paris. In 1886, two large exhibitions were staged, in which Pointillism and Neo-Impressionism were first exhibited, bringing attention to  Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on Boulevard Montmartre, but Van Gogh had problems acknowledging the new developments in art.\n\nConflicts arose between the brothers. At the end of 1886, Theo found that living with Vincent was \"almost unbearable\". By early 1887, they were again at peace, and Vincent had moved to Asnières, a northwestern suburb of Paris, where he became acquainted with Signac. He adopted elements of Pointillism, a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas such that – when seen from a distance – they create an optical blend of hues. The style stresses the ability of complementary colours – including blue and orange – to form vibrant contrasts when juxtaposed.\n\nFile:Van Gogh - Ein Paar Schuhe1.jpeg|A Pair of Boots, 1887, Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore, Maryland \nFile:WLANL - E V E - Absinthe Van Gogh Museum.jpg|Still Life with Glass of Absinthe and a Carafe, 1887, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam \nFile:Vincent van Gogh - In the café - Agostina Segatori in Le Tambourin - Google Art Project 2.jpg|Agostina Segatori Sitting in the Café du Tambourin, 1887.

Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam\n \n\n\t\nWhile in Asnières, Van Gogh painted parks and restaurants and the Seine, including Bridges across the Seine at Asnières. In November 1887, Theo and Vincent befriended Paul Gauguin who had just arrived in Paris. Towards the end of the year, Vincent arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard, Anquetin, and probably Toulouse-Lautrec, at the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, 43 Avenue de Clichy, Montmartre. In a contemporary account, Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of anything else in Paris. There Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings, and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin. Discussions on art, artists, and their social situations started during this exhibition, and continued and expanded to include visitors to the show, like Camille Pissarro and his son Lucien, Signac and Seurat. In February 1888, feeling worn out from life in Paris, he left, having painted more than 200 paintings during his two years there. Hours before his departure, accompanied by Theo, he paid his first and only visit to Seurat in his studio.\n\nArtistic breakthrough\n\nArles (1888–89)\n\nIll from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles. He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding a utopian art colony. The Danish artist Christian Mourier-Petersen became his companion for two months, and at first Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: \"The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to their First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world.\"\n\nIt became one of his more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, ultramarine and mauve. His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields. This was one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange for works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others.\n\nThe portrayals of the Arles landscape are informed by his Dutch upbringing; the patchwork of fields and avenues appear flat and lacking perspective, but excel in their use of colour. His new-found appreciation is seen in the range and scope of his work. That March he painted landscapes using a gridded \"perspective frame\"; three of the works were shown at the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants. In April, he was visited by the American artist Dodge MacKnight, who was living nearby at Fontvieille. On 1 May 1888, he signed a lease for 15 francs per month in the eastern wing of the Yellow House at No. 2 Place Lamartine. The rooms were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for some time.\n\nOn 7 May, Van Gogh moved from the Hôtel Carrel to the Café de la Gare, having befriended the proprietors, Joseph and Marie Ginoux. The Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in, but Van Gogh was able to use it as a studio. He wanted a gallery to display his work, and started a series of paintings that eventually included Van Gogh's Chair (1888), Bedroom in Arles (1888), The Night Café (1888), Cafe Terrace at Night (September 1888), Starry Night Over the Rhone (1888), and Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers (1888), all intended for the décoration for the Yellow House.\n\nVan Gogh wrote that with The Night Café he tried \"to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime.\"  When he visited Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer that June, he gave lessons to a Zouave second lieutenant – Paul-Eugène Milliet – and painted boats on the sea and the village. MacKnight introduced Van Gogh to Eugène Boch, a Belgian painter who stayed at times in Fontvieille, and the two exchanged visits in July.\n\nImage:Vincent Willem van Gogh 024.jpg|The Sower (after Millet), 1888\nFile:Vincent Van Gogh 0014.jpg|Langlois Bridge at Arles, 1888.

Albright–Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York\n\nGauguin's visit (1888)\n\n \t\n\nWhen Gauguin agreed to visit Arles in 1888, Van Gogh hoped for friendship, and the realisation of his idea of an artists' collective. While waiting that August he painted Sunflowers. When Boch visited again, Van Gogh painted a portrait of him, as well as the study The Poet Against a Starry Sky. Boch's sister Anna (1848–1936), also an artist, purchased The Red Vineyard in 1890.\n\nIn preparation for Gauguin's visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on advice from his friend, the station's postal supervisor Joseph Roulin, whose portrait he painted. On 17 September he spent the first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House. When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him, Van Gogh started to work on The Décoration for the Yellow House, probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook. Van Gogh completed two chair paintings: Van Gogh's Chair and Gauguin's Chair.\n\nAfter much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October, and that November the two finally painted together. Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his The Painter of Sunflowers: Portrait of Vincent van Gogh, while, uncharacteristically, Van Gogh painted pictures from memory (deferring to Gauguin's ideas) and his The Red Vineyard. Among these \"imaginative\" paintings is Memory of the Garden at Etten. Their first joint outdoor venture was at the Alyscamps, when they produced Les Alyscamps pendants.\n\nVan Gogh and Gauguin visited Montpellier that December, where they saw works by Courbet and Delacroix in the Musée Fabre. Their relationship began to deteriorate; he admired Gauguin and desperately wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, traits that frustrated Van Gogh. They often quarrelled; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him and the situation, which Van Gogh described as one of \"excessive tension,\" rapidly headed towards crisis point.\n\nFile:Le café de nuit (The Night Café) by Vincent van Gogh.jpeg|The Night Café, 1888, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT\nFile:Vincent Willem van Gogh - Cafe Terrace at Night (Yorck).jpg|Café Terrace At Night, 1888, Kröller-Müller Museum\nImage:Vincent Willem van Gogh 028.jpg|Les Arènes, (December 1888), Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg\nFile:Van Gogh Entrance to the Public Park in Arles.jpg|Entrance to the Public Park in Arles, 1888, Phillips Collection, Philadelphia\nFile:Vincent Willem van Gogh 138.jpg|Van Gogh's Chair, 1888. National Gallery, London\nFile:Vincent Willem van Gogh 082.jpg|Paul Gauguin's Armchair, 1888, Van Gogh Museum\n\nDecember 1888\n\n \n\nThe exact sequence of events which led to Van Gogh's removal of his ear is not known. Gauguin claimed, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour. Their relationship was complex, and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who was suspicious that the brothers were exploiting him financially. It seems likely that Van Gogh had realised that Gauguin was planning to leave. On 23 December, after days of rain with the two men shut in the Yellow House together, there was a contretemps between them. Gauguin's account was that he left the house for a walk and that Van Gogh followed, and \"rushed towards me, an open razor in his hand.\" This account is uncorroborated; Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely in a hotel.\n\nAfter the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh returned to his room, where, according to the art historian John Rewald, assaulted by auditory hallucinations, he severed his left ear  (either wholly or in part; accounts differ) with a razor, inducing a severe haemorrhage.  He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to Gabrielle Berlatier, a farmer's teenage daughter nicknamed Rachel, who worked at a brothel both Van Gogh and Gauguin frequented. Van Gogh went home, where he collapsed. He was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman, Alphonse Robert, and taken to hospital. He was treated by Félix Rey, a young doctor who was still in training. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey was unable to reattach it as too much time had elapsed since its removal.\n\nVan Gogh had no recollection of the event, and it is plain that he had suffered an acute psychotic episode. Family letters of the time make it clear that the breakdown had not been unexpected.  He had suffered a nervous collapse three years before in Antwerp, and as early as 1880 his father had proposed committing him to an asylum at Geel. The hospital diagnosis was \"generalised delirium\", and within a few days the local police ordered that he be placed in hospital care.  Theo was notified by Gauguin who rushed to Arles on 26 or 27 December. Theo had proposed marriage to his old friend Andries Bonger's sister Johanna on 24 December, the day after Vincent's violent act. During the first days of his treatment, Van Gogh repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked for Gauguin, who asked a policeman attending the case to \"be kind enough, Monsieur, to awaken this man with great care, and if he asks for me tell him I have left for Paris; the sight of me might prove fatal for him.\" Gauguin wrote of Van Gogh, \"His state is worse, he wants to sleep with the patients, chase the nurses, and washes himself in the coal bucket. That is to say, he continues the biblical mortifications.\" Visitors to the hospital included Madame Ginoux and Roulin. Gauguin fled Arles, never to see Van Gogh again. They continued to correspond and in 1890 Gauguin proposed they form an artist studio in Antwerp.\n\nDespite a pessimistic diagnosis, Van Gogh recovered and returned to the Yellow House by the beginning of January 1889, but spent the following month between hospital and home, suffering from hallucinations and delusions of poisoning. That March, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople (including the Ginoux family) who described him as \"le fou roux\" (the redheaded madman). Two months later, he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Around this time, he wrote, \"Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant.\" Paul Signac spent time with him in the hospital, and Van Gogh was allowed home in his company. In April, he moved into rooms owned by Dr Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home.\n\nFile:Vincent Willem van Gogh 106.jpg|Self-portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe, 1889, private collection\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with bandaged ear (1889, Courtauld Institute).jpg|Self-portrait with Bandaged Ear, 1889, Courtauld Institute of Art, London\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey (F500).jpg|Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey, 1889, Pushkin Museum\nFile:Van Gogh - Garten des Hospitals in Arles1.jpeg|The Courtyard of the Hospital at Arles, 1889, Oskar Reinhart Collection \"Am Römerholz\", Winterthur, Switzerland\nFile:Ward in the Hospital in Arles.jpg|Ward in the Hospital in Arles, 1889, Oskar Reinhart Collection \"Am Römerholz\", Winterthur, Switzerland\nFile:Van Gogh - Garten des Hospitals in Arles.jpeg|Garden of the Hospital in Arles, April 1889, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam\n  \n\nSaint-Rémy (May 1889 – May 1890)\n\nVan Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum on 8 May 1889, accompanied by his carer, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman. Saint-Paul was a former monastery, in Saint-Rémy less than 30 km from Arles, and at the time run by a former naval doctor, Théophile Peyron. Van Gogh had two small rooms, consisting of adjoining cells with barred windows. The second was to be used as a studio. While there, the clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings. He made several studies of hospital interiors, such as Vestibule of the Asylum and Saint-Rémy (September 1889). Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, including The Starry Night. He was allowed short supervised walks, which led to paintings of cypresses and olive trees, such as Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889, Cypresses 1889, Cornfield with Cypresses (1889), Country road in Provence by Night (1890). That September, he produced a further two versions of Bedroom in Arles.\n\nLimited access to life outside the clinic resulted in a shortage of subject matter. Van Gogh was left to work on interpretations of other artist's paintings, such as Millet's The Sower and Noon – Rest from Work (after Millet), as well as variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the Realism of Jules Breton, Gustave Courbet and Millet, and he compared his copies to a musician's interpreting Beethoven.\n\nMany of his most compelling works date from this period. His The Round of the Prisoners (1890) was painted after an engraving by Gustave Doré (1832–1883). It has been suggested that the face of the prisoner in the centre of the painting looking towards the viewer is Van Gogh himself, although the Van Gogh scholar Jan Hulsker discounts this.\n\nBetween February and April 1890 Van Gogh suffered a severe relapse. He was still able to paint and draw a little during this time, and he later wrote to Theo that he had made a few small canvases \"from memory ... reminisces of the North.\" Among these was Two Peasant Women Digging in a Snow-Covered Field at Sunset. Hulsker believes that this small group of paintings formed the nucleus of many drawings and study sheets depicting landscapes and figures that Van Gogh worked on during this time. He comments that this short period was the only time that Van Gogh's illness had a significant effect on his work. Vincent asked his mother and his brother to send him drawings and small sketches that he had done in the early 1880s so he could work on new paintings from his old sketches. Belonging to this period is Sorrowing Old Man (\"At Eternity's Gate\"), a colour study that Hulsker describes as \"another unmistakable remembrance of times long past.\"\n\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - Corridor in the Asylum.JPG|Corridor in Saint-Paul Hospital, Oil color and essence over black chalk on pink laid (\"Ingres\") paper, 1889, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York   \nFile:Hospital in Saint-Remy.jpg| Pine Trees with Figure in the Garden of Saint-Paul Hospital, 1889, Musée d'Orsay, Paris, France\nFile:Vincent Willem van Gogh 037.jpg|The Round of the Prisoners (after Doré), 1890.

Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo\n\nIn February 1890, Van Gogh painted five versions of L'Arlésienne (Madame Ginoux), based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November 1888. The version intended for Madame Ginoux is lost. It was attempting to deliver this painting to Ginoux in Arles that precipitated his February relapse. Albert Aurier praised his work in the Mercure de France in January 1890, and described him as \"a genius\".\n\nThat February, he was invited by Les XX, a society of avant-garde painters in Brussels, to participate in their annual exhibition. At the opening dinner, Les XX-member Henry de Groux insulted Van Gogh's work. Toulouse-Lautrec demanded satisfaction, and Signac declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh's honour if Lautrec surrendered. Later, while Van Gogh's exhibit was on display with the Artistes Indépendants in Paris, Claude Monet said that his work was the best in the show. In February 1890, when his nephew was born, he wrote \"I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky.\"\n\nAuvers-sur-Oise (May–July 1890)\n\nIn May 1890, Van Gogh left the clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both Dr Paul Gachet in Auvers-sur-Oise and to Theo. Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists. Camille Pissarro had recommended him. Van Gogh's first impression was that Gachet was \"iller than I am, it seemed to me, or let's say just as much.\" In June 1890, he painted several portraits of his  doctor, including Portrait of Dr. Gachet, and his only etching. In each the emphasis is on Gachet's melancholic disposition.\n\nDuring Van Gogh's last weeks at Saint-Rémy, his thoughts returned to his \"memories of the North\", and several of the approximately 70 oils, painted during as many days in Auvers-sur-Oise, are reminiscent of northern scenes. Barbizon painter Charles Daubigny had moved to Auvers in 1861, and in turn drew other artists there, including Camille Corot and Honoré Daumier. In July 1890, Van Gogh completed two paintings of Daubigny's Garden, one of which is likely his final work. There are other paintings that show evidence of being unfinished, including Thatched Cottages by a Hill.\n\nVan Gogh's late paintings show an artist at the height of his abilities, according to the art critic Robert Hughes, \"longing for concision and grace\". Many of these works are sombre, and reflective of a desire to return to lucid mental health. Yet some reflect deepening concerns. In July 1890, Van Gogh wrote that he had become absorbed \"in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow.\" He had become captivated by the fields in May when the wheat was young and green. In July he described to Theo \"vast fields of wheat under turbulent skies\". He wrote that they represented his \"sadness and extreme loneliness\", and that the \"canvases will tell you what I cannot say in words, that is, how healthy and invigorating I find the countryside.\" Wheatfield with Crows is a painting Hulsker discusses as being associated with \"melancholy and extreme loneliness.\" Hulsker identifies seven oil paintings as following the completion of the Wheatfield with Crows in July 1890 while in Auvers.\n\nFile: Vincent van Gogh - The Church in Auvers-sur-Oise, View from the Chevet - Google Art Project.jpg|The Church at Auvers, 1890.

Although depressed and unable to bring himself to write, he continued to draw and paint. For a year he \"had fits of despair and hallucination during which he could not work, between long clear months in which he could and did, punctuated by extreme visionary ecstasy.\"\n\nOn 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. There were no witnesses. The location of the shooting may have been in the wheat field he had been painting recently, or a local barn. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine. He was able to walk back to the Auberge Ravoux, where he was attended by two doctors. Without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. The doctors tended to him as best they could, then left him alone in his room, smoking his pipe. The following morning, Theo rushed to his brother as soon as notified, and found him in surprisingly good health. But within hours Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died that evening, 29 hours after the gunshot. According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: \"The sadness will last forever\".\n\n \nVan Gogh was buried on 30 July, in the municipal cemetery of Auvers-sur-Oise. The funeral was attended by Theo van Gogh, Andries Bonger, Charles Laval, Lucien Pissarro, Émile Bernard, Julien Tanguy and Dr Gachet among twenty family, friends and locals. Theo suffered from syphilis and his health declined rapidly after Vincent's death. Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent's absence, he died on 25 January 1891 at Den Dolder, and was buried in Utrecht. In 1914, Jo Bonger had Theo's body exhumed, moved from Utrecht and re-buried with Vincent at Auvers-sur-Oise.\n\nThere have been numerous debates as to the nature of Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work. Over 150 psychiatrists have attempted to label its root, with 30 different diagnoses. These have included schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, syphilis, poisoning from swallowed paints, temporal lobe epilepsy, and acute intermittent porphyria. Any of these could have been the culprit, aggravated by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol, especially absinthe.\n\nStyle and works\n\nArtistic development\n\nVan Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged. When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he improved the lighting of his studio by installing variable shutters and experimented with different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborate studies in black and white, which at the time gained him only criticism. Today, they are recognised as his first masterpieces.\n\nIn August 1882, Theo gave Vincent a donation, used to buy materials for working en plein air. Vincent wrote that he could now \"go on painting with new vigour\". From early in 1883 he worked on multi-figure compositions, on which he based on his drawings. He had some of them photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to oil painting. Van Gogh turned to renowned Hague School artists like Weissenbruch and Blommers, and received technical support from them, as well as from painters like De Bock and Van der Weele, both second generation Hague School artists. When he moved to Nuenen after the intermezzo in Drenthe he began several large paintings but destroyed most of them. The Potato Eaters and its companion pieces are the only ones to have survived. Following a visit to the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh was aware that many of his faults were due to lack of technical experience, so in November 1885 he travelled to Antwerp and later Paris to learn and develop his skill.\n\nTheo criticised The Potato Eaters for its dark palette, which he thought unsuitable for a modern style. During Van Gogh's stay in Paris between 1886 and 1887, he quickly tried to master a new, lighter palette. His Portrait of Père Tanguy (1887) shows his success with the brighter palette; with its colour innovations it is evidence of an evolving personal style. Charles Blanc's treatise on colour interested him greatly, and led him to work with complementary colours. Van Gogh came to the conclusion that colour went beyond descriptive; he said that \"colour expresses something in itself\". According to Hughes, Van Gogh perceived colour as having a \"psychological and moral weight\", as characterised in the garish reds and greens of The Night Cafe, a work he wanted \"to express the terrible passions of humanity\". Yellow meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and God.\n\nThroughout his career Van Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature, and during his first summer in Arles he brought the more modern palette to bear on landscapes and traditional rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's own religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to revise, rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism but not traditional Christian iconography; rather he made up his own where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In the summer in Arles, under a hot sun and having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower. The juxtaposition of saturated complementary colours and the single figure in the landscape represents a unique innovative style.\n\nVan Gogh stayed within what he called the \"guise of reality\", and was critical of overly abstract or stylised works. He tried his hand at stylisation and abstraction with Starry Night, but he said about that painting that reality had \"receded too far in the background\". Hughes describes Starry Night as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy: the stars are in a great whirl, reminiscent of Hokusai's Great Wave, the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of the cypress on the earth below, and the painter's vision is \"translated into a thick, emphatic plasma of paint.\"\n\nBetween 1885 and his death in 1890, Van Gogh appears to have been building an oeuvre, a collection that reflected his personal vision, and could be commercially successful. He was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word \"purposeful\" to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies. He painted many series of studies. Most of them were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends. The finished paintings – such as Night Cafe and Starry Night, are the works he considered part of his oeuvre. The work in Arles contributed considerably to his oeuvre: those he thought the most important from that time were The Sower, Night Cafe, Memory of the Garden in Etten and  Starry Night. With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colours, contours and designs, these are the paintings that represent the style he sought. He considered The Bedroom his best work of that period, because the inventive use of perspective, combined with Impressionist techniques, resulted in the style he sought.\n\nIn the end, the style Van Gogh found was revolutionary \"in the very look of his pictures, their coarseness and deliberately unfinished quality, the vigor with which they were painted.\" His art, with its emphasis on the common people and a wish for a better world, presages the 20th century and Modernism.\n\nMajor series\n\nVan Gogh's stylistic developments are usually linked to periods he spent living in different locations across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as a painter was slow, and he was aware of his painterly limitations; many of his early works could be described as gauche. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill.\n\nPortraits\n\n  \nVan Gogh is best known for his landscapes, but portraits were his greatest ambition. He said of portrait studies, that they were \"the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite.\" He wrote to his sister that he \"should like to paint portraits which appear after a century to people living then as apparitions ... I do not endeavour to achieve this through photographic resemblance, but my means of our impassioned emotions – that is to say using our knowledge and our modern taste for colour as a means of arriving at the expression and the intensification of the character.\" Those closest to him are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo, Van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of his mother were from photographs.\n\nPortraiture represented Van Gogh's best opportunity of earning money. Some of the portraits are studies. Those with greater significance, which he considered finished paintings, are identifiable with the subject holding an object such as a book, and tend to exhibit more stylisation than his other work.\n\nIn December 1888, he painted La Berceuse – a figure that he thought as good as his sunflower still lifes. It had a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a culmination of portraits of the Roulin family he executed in Arles between November and December. They showed a shift in style from the fluid and restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.\n\nFile:Van Gogh - Bildnis der Mutter des Künstlers.jpeg|Portrait of Artist's Mother, October 1888, The Norton Simon Museum of Art, Pasadena, California\nFile:Vangogh mousme.jpg|La Mousmé, 1888.

They were often completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continue until his the last weeks of his life in Auvers-sur-Oise, when he produced many paintings but no self-portraits, as he returned to painting the natural world. Generally they were studies, created during introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix with others or lacked models, and so painted himself. They reflect a intense degree of self-scrutiny that, according to Hughes, is \"seldom if ever\" apparent in an artist. Often they mark important transitionalor breakthrough periods in his development, for example with the mid 1887 Paris series, where be became influenced by Claude Monet, Paul Cezanne and Signac. In Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat, heavy strains of paint spread outwards across the canvas, \"encircling the head with a background halo\".\n\nThe self-portraits contain a wide array of physiognomical representations, in which, according to Melissa McQuillan \"the entire facial structure seems to belong to different men\". His mental and physical condition is usually apparent, he may appear unkempt, unshaven or with a neglected beard, with deeply sunken eyes, a weak jaw, or having suffered loss of teeth. Some show him with full lips, a long face or prominent skull, or sharpened, alert features. His hair may be the usual recognisable red, or at times ash coloured. He wrote, \"I...exaggerate my personality...I want to emphasis the fact that one and the same person may furnish motifs for very different portraits.\"\n\nHis gaze is seldom directed at the viewer; and even when fixed, he appears to look elsewhere. They vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted in the aftermath December 1888 especially, the intensely vivid colourisation serves to highlight the haggard pallor of his skin. Some of the portraits depict the artist with beard, some without, and others with bandages – in the period after he had severed his ear. In only a few does he refer to his social class or profession as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his mutilated ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror. \n\nFile:Van Gogh - Selbstbildnisse.jpeg| Two Self-Portraits and Several Details, Drawing, Paris, 1886.

This painting may have been Van Gogh's last self-portrait. He gave it to his mother as a birthday gift.  \n\nFlowers\n\nVan Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including the Irises, Sunflowers, lilacs and roses sequences. Some reflect his interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese ukiyo-e.\n\nThere are two series of dying sunflowers. The first were painted in Paris in 1887 and show flowers lying on the ground. The second set was completed a year later in Arles, and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light. Both are built from thickly layered paintwork, which, according to the London National Gallery, evokes the \"texture of the seed-heads\". \n\nVan Gogh was not preoccupied by his usual interest in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather the two series are intended to display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin, who was about to visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888, \"I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers ... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go.\"\n\nThe sunflowers were painted to decorate the walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the Yellow House's guest room in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed. The only painting Van Gogh  completed during Gauguin's first visit was Van Gogh Painting Sunflowers. Aware of their worth, Gauguin later acquired two of the Paris versions.\n\nAfter Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and included them in his Les XX in Brussels exhibit. Today the major pieces of the series are perhaps his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.\n\nFile:Vincent Willem van Gogh 128.jpg|Vase with Twelve Sunflowers, August 1888.

Van Gogh Museum\n\nCypresses\n\nThe cypresses, comprising fifteen canvases, are among Van Gogh's most popular and widely known series. In Arles he became fascinated with the trees. He brought life to the trees traditionally emblematic of death, writing of them \"The trees are always occupying my thoughts – it astonishes me that they have never been done as I see them\". The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance, as windbreaks in fields; while he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to the foreground. Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: \"Cypresses still preoccupy me, I should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers\"; he goes on to say \"They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk.\"\n\nIn mid-1889, at his sister Wil's request, Van Gogh painted several smaller versions of Wheat Field with Cypresses. The works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto, and include one of his best-known paintings, The Starry Night, in which the cypress dominates the foreground. Hughes writes of the cypress in Starry Night that it is \"More alive than any painted tree has ever been, (and more so than any real cypress looks)\".\n\nOther works include Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background (1889), Cypresses (1889), Cypresses with Two Figures (1889–90), Road with Cypress and Star (1890) and Starry Night Over the Rhone (1888). Road with Cypress and Star (1890) is as compositionally unreal and artificial as The Starry Night. It represents an exalted experience of reality, what both Van Gogh and Gauguin referred to as an \"abstraction\". Referring to Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background, on or around 18 June 1889, in a letter to his brother, Van Gogh wrote, \"At last I have a landscape with olives and also a new study of a Starry Night.\"\n\nWhile in the asylum, he spent time outside painting the trees in the olive groves. These are rendered as gnarled and arthritic as if a personification of the natural world, according to Hughes who explains that they are filled with \"a continuous field of energy of which nature is a manifestation\".\n\nFile:Van Gogh Starry Night Drawing.jpg|Cypresses in Starry Night, a reed pen drawing executed by Van Gogh after the painting in 1889.

The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive, silent, quiet and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of transience and belief in a new beginning in Arles, and it presented him with a world of Japanese motifs which he revelled in. Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and \"one big [painting] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled\".\n\nDuring this period Van Gogh mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and bringing light to the forefront of the trees as if the trees and blossoms themselves are the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was consumed by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. Because of the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.\n\nFile:Vincent Willem van Gogh 113.jpg|Souvenir de Mauve, c. 30 March 1888, Kröller-Müller Museum\nFile:WLANL - artanonymous - De roze boomgaard.jpg|The Pink Orchard also Orchard with Blossoming Apricot Trees, March 1888.

He made paintings featuring harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond. At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in The Wheat Field series, which depicted the view from his adjoining cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.\n\nMany of the late paintings are sombre but essentially optimistic and, right up to the time of his death, reflect his desire to return to lucid mental health. Yet some of his final works reflect his deepening concerns. Writing in July 1890, from Auvers, Van Gogh said that he had become absorbed \"in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow.\"\n\nHe was captivated by the fields in May when the wheat was young and green. His Wheatfields at Auvers with White House shows a more subdued palette of yellows and blues, against the growing wheat and corn, which creates a sense of idyllic harmony.\n\nThe weather worsened in July. He wrote to Theo of \"vast fields of wheat under troubled skies\". In particular, the work Wheatfield with Crows serves as a compelling and poignant expression of the artist's state of mind in his final days, a painting Hulsker describes as a \"doom-filled painting with threatening skies and ill-omened crows.\" Its dark palette and heavy brushstrokes convey a sense of impending doom and menace.\n\nImage:Vincent Willem van Gogh 007.jpg|Enclosed Wheat Field with Rising Sun, May 1889, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands\nFile:Vincent Willem van Gogh, Dutch - Rain - Google Art Project.jpg|Rain or Enclosed Wheat Field in the Rain, November 1889, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia\nFile:Landscape with wheat sheaves and rising moon.jpg|Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series), early June 1889.

Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nPosthumous fame\n\nEarly popularity\n\nAfter Van Gogh's first exhibitions in the late 1880s, his reputation grew slowly but steadily among artists, art critics, dealers and collectors. In 1887 André Antoine installed Van Gogh's paintings alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, at the Théâtre Libre in Paris; some were acquired by Julien Tanguy. In 1889 his work was described in the journal Le Moderniste Illustré by the poet Albert Aurier as characterised by \"fire, intensity, sunshine\". Aurier, Van Gogh's first critical champion, died of typhoid fever in 1892 at the age of twenty-seven.\n\nTheo's death in January 1891 had removed Vincent's most vocal and well connected champion. Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her twenties who had not known either her husband or her brother-in law very long and who suddenly had to take care of several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. Theo had been the sole support of his family, and Van Gogh-Bonger was left with only an apartment in Paris, a few items of furniture, and the near-valueless works of her brother-in-law Vincent. According to Rewald, Gauguin was not inclined to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh's reputation, and her brother Andries Bonger also seemed to be lukewarm about his work.\n\nMemorial exhibitions were held in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in several high-profile exhibitions in 1890, including six works at Les XX and ten paintings were shown at the \"Société des Artistes Indépendants\" while he was still alive, in Brussels that January; in 1891 there was also a retrospective exhibition there. In 1892 the art critic Octave Mirbeau wrote that Van Gogh's suicide was an \"infinitely sadder loss for art ... even though the populace has not crowned to a magnificent funeral, and poor Vincent van Gogh, whose demise means the extinction of a beautiful flame of genius, has gone to his death as obscure and neglected as he lived.\" In 1892, Émile Bernard organised a small solo show of Van Gogh's paintings in Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his Van Gogh paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. Several Van Gogh paintings were sold in Paris after Tanguy's death in 1894. In April 1894 the Durand-Rue Gallery in Paris agreed to take 10 paintings on consignment from his estate.\n\nIn 1896, the Fauvist painter Henri Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited the artist John Peter Russell on Belle Île off Brittany. Russell was an Impressionist; Matisse had never previously seen an Impressionist work directly, and was so shocked at the style that he left after ten days, saying, \"I couldn't stand it any more.\" The next year he returned as Russell's student and abandoned his earth-coloured palette for bright Impressionist colours, later stating, \"Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained colour theory to me.\" Russell had been a close friend of Vincent van Gogh. He introduced Van Gogh's work to Matisse and gave him a Van Gogh drawing. In Paris in 1901 a large retrospective was held at the Bernheim-Jaune Galleries, which excited André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck, and underscored and contributed to the emergence of the Fauve movement.\n\nRetrospectives were held in Paris in 1901 and 1905, and at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam in 1905. Important group exhibitions with the Sonderbund artists in Cologne in 1912, the Armory Show, New York in 1913, and Berlin in 1914 followed. In 1905 Van Gogh's work was exhibited at Galerie Ernst Arnold in Dresden, which influenced painters of Die Brücke – particularly Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. By 1906 Johanna van Gogh-Bonger could still show a complete set of his works,  although she was in correspondence with artists, galleries, critics, dealers throughout Europe. She worked with Berlin dealer Paul Cassirer who mounted 10 exhibitions, and staged tours to see Van Gogh's work. Henk Bremmer was instrumental in teaching and talking about Van Gogh, and introduced Helene Kröller-Müller to Van Gogh's art; she quickly became an avid collector.\n\n20th century\n\nVan Gogh's fame reached its first peak in Austria and Germany before World War I, aided by the publication of his letters in three volumes in 1914. These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young. Bremmer assisted Jacob Baart de la Faille, whose catalogue raisonné Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Works on Paper appeared in 1928.  In 1934 American novelist Irving Stone published an account of Vincent van Gogh's life entitled Lust for Life, and according to Stone he relied on Van Gogh's letters to Theo. This book and the 1956 film of the same name further enhanced the artist's fame.\n\nIn 1957, Francis Bacon based a series of paintings on reproductions of Van Gogh's The Painter on the Road to Tarascon, the original of which was destroyed during World War II. Bacon was inspired by an image he described as \"haunting\", and by Van Gogh himself, whom he regarded as an alienated outsider, a position which resonated with him. Bacon identified with Van Gogh's theories of art and quoted lines written to Theo: \"[R]eal painters do not paint things as they are ... [T]hey paint them as they themselves feel them to be.\"\n\nThe Van Gogh Museum opened in Amsterdam in 1973. When the Rijksmuseum held an exhibition in 1990 for the centenary of Van Gogh's death, paintings came from the Van Gogh Museum and the Kröller-Müller Museum, which house the two largest Van Gogh collections in the world. Additional works were borrowed from 17 countries, 11 of which lent a single work each. The United States was the largest lender, sending works from 13 collections. For the occasion, Beatrix of the Netherlands wrote about the native son of the Netherlands: \"Only a small circle of artists showed any interest in his work during his own lifetime. Now he is a household name and his paintings and drawings are admired throughout the world.\"\n\nToday Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings. Those sold for over US$100 million (today's equivalent) include Portrait of Dr. Gachet, Portrait of Joseph Roulin and Irises. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's edition of A Wheatfield with Cypresses was acquired in 1993 for US$57 million.\n\nRomanticised life \n\nVan Gogh was considered a madman and failure by many of those who knew him, and was dismissed from jobs and alienated from communities for this reason. This view has endured to the present day, but in a different light. Today he is widely romanticised as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist for whom \"discourses on madness and creativity converge\", and whose work often consists of \"emotion-fuelled spontaneity\". Van Gogh's life, mental health and status as an societal outsider, or \"stranger on earth\" as described by art historian Judy Sund, has been idealised in many biographies (both art historical and popular), newspaper and magazine articles, speculative medical journal articles, novels, films, album covers and video games.\n\nSeveral factors have assisted this. His eventful, varied and dramatic life was superficially filled with high and lows. He was highly complex and a mass of contradictions, thus allowing projection by a wide variety of geographically and temporally dispersed view points. His mental difficulties were never diagnosed, do not easily fit into any category and are thus left open. He was an everyman, reinforced by the fact that although highly cultured and well read, he came from a modest family, and although he could live in capital cities such The Hague or Paris and befriend the major modernist painters of the day, he preferred rural settings, sometimes as a pauper. He used only his first name \"Vincent\" as signature for his paintings and drawings. Although he had love affairs, they were obsessive in nature and none were lasting. He was single, thus available, for most of his years. Solitary by nature, he was highly prolific and industrious, maintaining an exceptional work ethic of over one artwork per day especially in the period before he died.\n\nVan Gogh was very human in his personal failings; he worried about his mental health while living recklessly. He often neglected to eat or sleep properly, usually as a result of drinking to excess. He had a blind spot as to the effect of his presence on others, who were mostly, with reason, hostile. He was deeply interested in the advancement of modernism and adapted its innovations. Yet his paintings are accessible to all; he worked and died before the more alienating non-figurative abstractions of the 1900s and 1910s. Similarly, his choices of colour were often discordant and hallucinatory in individual passages, but canvasses strove for tonal harmony. He considered his art not so much a break from the past as more a line in the continuum; an attractive feature for 20th century tastemakers still interested in broad sweeps of art history.\n\nHis letters are expressive and literate, and were described as among the foremost 19th-century writings of their kind. They are extremely open and honest, and allow a rare unguarded and accessible insight into the creative process and mindset."

                "The Blue Period () is a term used to define the works produced by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso between 1901 and 1904 when he painted essentially monochromatic paintings in shades of blue and blue-green, only occasionally warmed by other colors. These somber works, inspired by Spain and painted in Barcelona and Paris, are now some of his most popular works, although he had difficulty selling them at the time.\n\nThis period's starting point is uncertain; it may have begun in Spain in the spring of 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the year.  In choosing austere color and sometimes doleful subject matter—prostitutes, beggars and drunks are frequent subjects—Picasso was influenced by a journey through Spain and by the suicide of his friend; Carlos Casagemas took his life at the  L’Hippodrome Café in Paris, France by shooting himself in the right temple on February 17, 1901. Although Picasso himself later recalled, \"I started painting in blue when I learned of Casagemas's death\",  art historian Hélène Seckel has written: \"While we might be right to retain this psychologizing justification, we ought not lose sight of the chronology of events: Picasso was not there when Casagemas committed suicide in Paris ... When Picasso returned to Paris in May, he stayed in the studio of his departed friend, where he worked for several more weeks to prepare his exhibition for Vollard\".  The works Picasso painted for his show at Ambroise Vollard's gallery that summer were generally characterized by a \"dazzling palette and exuberant subject matter\". Picasso's psychological state worsened as 1901 continued. \n\nIn the latter part of 1901, Picasso sank into a severe depression and blue tones began to dominate his paintings. Picasso's painting La mort de Casagemas, completed early in the year following his friend's suicide, was done in hot, bright hues. The painting considered the first of his Blue Period, Casagemas in His Coffin, was completed later in 1901 when Picasso was sinking into a major depression. Picasso, normally an outgoing socializer, withdrew from his friends. Picasso's bout of depression was to last several years.  Picasso's career had been promising before 1901 and early in that year he was making \"a splash\" in Paris. However, as he moved towards subject matter such as society's poor and outcast, and accented this with a cool, anguished mood with blue hues, the critics and the public turned away from his works. Members of the public were uninterested in displaying the Blue Period works in their homes.  Picasso continued his output, but his financial situation suffered:\n\nFrom 1901 to 1903, he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas, culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting La Vie, painted in 1903 and now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.  The same mood pervades the well-known etching The Frugal Repast (1904) which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table. Blindness is a recurrent theme in Picasso's works of this period, also represented in The Blindman's Meal (1903, the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and in the portrait of Celestina (1903). \n\nInfrared imagery of Picasso's 1901 painting The Blue Room reveals another painting beneath the surface.  \n\nOther frequent subjects include female nudes and mothers with children. Solitary figures dominate his Blue Period works. Themes of loneliness, poverty and despair pervade the works as well. Possibly his most well known work from this period is The Old Guitarist. Other major works include Portrait of Soler (1903) and Las dos hermanas (1904). \n\nPicasso's Blue Period was followed by his Rose Period. Picasso's bout with depression gradually ended, and as his psychological state improved, he moved towards more joyful, vibrant works, and emphasized the use of pinks (\"rose\" in French) and other warm hues to express the shift in mood and subject matter. \n\nThe painting Portrait of Suzanne Bloch (1904), one of the final works from this period, was stolen from the São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP) on December 20, 2007, but retrieved on January 8, 2008.\n\nFile:Le Gourmet.JPG|Pablo Picasso, 1901, Le Gourmet (The Greedy Child), National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1901, Harlequin and his Companion (Les deux saltimbanques), oil on canvas, 73 x 60 cm, Pushkin Museum, Moscow.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1901, Harlequin and his Companion (Les deux saltimbanques), oil on canvas, 73 x 60 cm, Pushkin Museum, Moscow\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1901-02, Femme aux Bras Croisés, Woman with Folded Arms (Madchenbildnis), oil on canvas, 81 × 58 cm (32 × 23 in).jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1901–02, Femme aux Bras Croisés (Woman with Folded Arms)\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1901-02, Le bock (Portrait de Jaime Sabartes), The Glass of Beer (Portrait of the Poet Sabartes), oil on canvas, 82 x 66 cm, Pushkin Museum, Moscow.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1901–02, Le bock (Portrait de Jaime Sabartes), The Glass of Beer (Portrait of the Poet Sabartes), oil on canvas, 82 x 66 cm, Pushkin Museum, Moscow\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1902, Woman with Bangs, 61.3 x 51.4 cm, The Baltimore Museum of Art, Maryland.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1902, Woman with Bangs, 61.3 x 51.4 cm, The Baltimore Museum of Art, Maryland\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1902-03, Femme assise (Melancholy Woman), oil on canvas, 100 x 69.2 cm, The Detroit Museum of Art.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1902–03, Femme assise (Melancholy Woman), oil on canvas, 100 x 69.2 cm, Detroit Institute of Arts, Michigan\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1902-03, La soupe (The soup), oil on canvas, 38.5 x 46.0 cm, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Canada.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1902–03, La soupe (The soup), oil on canvas, 38.5 x 46.0 cm, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Canada\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1903, Desemparats (Maternité, Mère et enfant au fichu, Motherhood), pastel on paper, 47.5 x 41 cm, Museu Picasso, Barcelona.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1903, Desemparats (Maternité, Mère et enfant au fichu, Motherhood), pastel on paper, 47.5 x 41 cm, Museu Picasso, Barcelona\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1904, Woman with a Helmet of Hair, gouache on tan wood pulp board, 42.7 x 31.3 cm, Art Institute of Chicago.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1904, Woman with a Helmet of Hair, gouache on tan wood pulp board, 42.7 x 31.3 cm, Art Institute of Chicago\nFile:Picasso la vie.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1903, La Vie, Cleveland Museum of Art\nFile:The Tragedy.JPG|Pablo Picasso, 1903, The Tragedy, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\nImage:Picasso-suzanne bloch.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1904, Portrait of Suzanne Bloch, São Paulo Museum of Art",
                "Picasso's Rose Period represents an important epoch in the life and work of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso and had a great impact on the developments of modern art. It began in 1904 at a time when Picasso settled in Montmartre at the Bateau-Lavoir among bohemian poets and writers. Following Picasso's Blue Period, depicting themes of poverty, loneliness, and despair in somber tones of daunting blues, Picasso's Rose Period represents more pleasant themes of clowns, harlequins, carnival performers, depicted in cheerful vivid hues of red, orange, pink and earth tones. Based largely on intuition rather than direct observation, Picasso's Rose Period marks the beginning of the artists' stylistic experiments with primitivism; influenced by pre-Roman Iberian sculpture, Oceanic and African art. This led to Picasso's African Period in 1907, culminating in the Proto-Cubist masterpiece Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.  \n\nOverview\n\t\n\t\nThe Rose Period lasted from 1904 to 1906. Picasso was happy in his relationship with Fernande Olivier whom he had met in 1904 and this has been suggested as one of the possible reasons he changed his style of painting. Harlequins, circus performers and clowns appear frequently in the Rose Period and populated Picasso's paintings at various stages throughout the rest of his long career. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso.\n\nThe Rose Period has been considered French influenced, while the Blue Period more Spanish influenced, although both styles emerged while Picasso was living in Paris. Picasso's Blue Period began in late 1901, following the death of his friend Carlos Casagemas and the onset of a bout of major depression.  It lasted until 1904, when Picasso's psychological condition improved. The Rose Period is named after Picasso's heavy use of pink tones in his works from this period, from the French word for pink, which is rose.\n\nPicasso's highest selling painting, Garçon à la pipe (Boy with a pipe) was painted during the Rose Period. Other significant Rose Period works include: Woman in a Chemise (Madeleine) (1904–05), The Actor (1904–1905),  Lady with a Fan (1905), Two Youths (1905), Harlequin Family (1905), Harlequin's Family With an Ape (1905), La famille de saltimbanques (1905), Boy with a Dog (1905), Nude Boy (1906), Boy Leading a Horse (1905-06), and The Girl with a Goat (1906).\n\nFile:Picasso The Actor 1904.JPG|Pablo Picasso, 1904, L'acteur (The Actor), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1905, Acrobate à la Boule (Acrobat on a Ball), oil on canvas, 147 x 95 cm, The Pushkin Museum, Moscow.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1905, Acrobate à la Boule (Acrobat on a Ball), oil on canvas, 147 x 95 cm, The Pushkin Museum, Moscow\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1904-05, Les Baladins (Mother and Child, Acrobats), gouache on canvas, 90 x 71 cm Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1904–05, Les Baladins (Mother and Child, Acrobats), gouache on canvas, 90 x 71 cm Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1905, Nus (Nudes), pencil on paper.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1905, Nus (Nudes), pencil on paper\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1905, Acrobat's Family with a Monkey (Famille au Singe), collage, gouache, watercolor, pastel and india ink on carboard, 104 x 75 cm, Göteborgs Konstmuseum, Goteburg.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1905, Acrobat's Family with a Monkey (Famille au Singe), collage, gouache, watercolor, pastel and India ink on cardboard, 104 x 75 cm, Göteborgs Konstmuseum, Goteburg\nImage:Garçon à la pipe.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1905, Garçon à la pipe, (Boy with a Pipe).

It was the first ceremony to be held simultaneously in two                   locations. It resulted in the largest audience in commercial                   television history. Hollywood had to admit and succumb to the                   competing pressures from the burgeoning home entertainment                   medium. The show was telecast throughout the US and Canada.\nThe Best Picture Award was another surprise and                   is forever considered one of the Academy's worst choices for                   the top prize. 1952 has been considered one of the years in                   which the Academy blundered the greatest in its choice of Best                   Picture. The bloated, lumbering, melodramatic epic The Greatest                   Show on Earth was one of the Academy's biggest gaffes.\nThis year also marked the first time in                   Oscar's history that all of the top six prizes (Best Picture,                   Director, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actor, and Supporting                   Actress) went to six different films. This would occur again                   in 1956, and then 49 years later in 2005.\nInstead of going to the favored, critically-acclaimed,                   definitive and popular western\nHigh                     Noon , the top Oscar - in a major upset - went                   to the \"P.T. Barnum of Hollywood,\" legendary director/producer                   Cecil B. De Mille's gaudy epic spectacular about the struggling                   Ringling Brothers-Barnum and Bailey Circus, The Greatest                     Show on Earth (with five nominations and two wins - Best                   Picture and Best Writing: Original Story). De Mille's cornball                   film chronicled the financial and personal problems (a romantic                   triangle) of the tough, three-ring circus manager (Charlton                   Heston in one of his earliest films), a beautiful, high-bar                   aerialist (Betty Hutton), a crippled trapeze artist/performer                   (Cornel Wilde), a clown (James Stewart), and others. This ponderous                   Best Picture is best known not for its acting (even though                   it was nominated and won for Best Original Story!) but for                   its spectacular train-wreck sequence.\nThe award, more than honoring the film, also                   saluted the film's producer, DeMille \"the father (or founder)                   of Hollywood,\" with his only Best Picture Oscar                   - and his sole Best Director nomination. [Apologetically, in                   recognition of his outstanding years of producing and directing,                   De Mille received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award instead.]                   He was known for making the first feature-length movie in Hollywood, The                     Squaw Man (1914), and many other larger than life, 'cast                   of thousands' films in his past (including The Ten Commandments                     (1923), The Sign of the Cross (1932), Cleopatra                       (1934) , Samson and Delilah (1949), and a second                   version of The Ten Commandments (1956) ,                   his last film). His The Greatest Show on Earth was one                   of the first Best Pictures that was a big-budget blockbuster                   with lots of special effects. The Academy felt obligated, presumably, to honor the great director as his career was coming to an                   end.\nThe four other Best Picture nominees were diverse:\nthe front-runner - the taut, gripping Western                     showdown about a Hadleyville town marshal who faces four                     professional killers in director Fred Zinnemann's character                     study\nHigh                       Noon (with six nominations and four wins - Best Actor,                     Best Song - Dimitri Tiomkin's \"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh                     My Darlin'\", Best Dramatic Score, and Best Film Editing).                     The Academy followed its familiar pattern of snubbing western                     genre films by denying the Best Picture Oscar to a western.                     [Very few westerns have ever been nominated for Best Picture.                     By century's end, only three have won the top award, Cimarron                       (1930/31), Dances With Wolves (1990), and Unforgiven                       (1992) .]\nthe portrait of the life of dwarfish, impressionistic                     artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in director John Huston's Moulin                       Rouge (with seven nominations and two wins - Best Color                     Art Direction and Set Decoration, and Best Color Costume                     Design)\nSir Walter Scott's chivalrous romance novel                     lavishly adapted for the screen in director Richard Thorpe's Ivanhoe (with                     three nominations and no wins)\nJohn Ford's Irish romantic comedy\nThe                     Quiet Man (with seven nominations and two wins                     - Best Director and Best Color Cinematography) about                     an American ex-boxer (John Wayne) who returns to his                     childhood Irish town of Innisfree and attempts to romance                     a spirited Irish lass (Maureen O'Hara)\nIt was his sixth nomination for which John Ford                   won his fourth Academy Award as Best Director for his                   epic romantic comedy\nThe                     Quiet Man (1952) . It was a record for the director                   (and for Academy history - the most Best Director wins for                   a film director), but it would be his last nomination                   and Oscar. [His earlier three Best Director wins were in 1935,                   1940, and 1941. Ford lost the Best Director award for\nStagecoach                     (1939) and the Best Picture award for The Long Voyage                       Home (1940). After his last win in 1952, he went on to                   direct more great western classics, including\nThe                     Searchers (1956) and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance                       (1962). Remarkably, John Ford never won an Oscar                   for his Westerns, the major core of his work.] DeMille was                   only nominated for director once - for this 1952-winning Best                   Picture, but he lost. [His films were nominated for Best Picture two other times - Cleopatra (1934) and The                   Ten Commandments (1956) .]\nAlthough it was defeated for the Best Picture                   award (with Stanley Kramer as producer), UA's\nHigh                     Noon managed to bring an Oscar statuette to mythic,                   small-town, retired Marshal Will Kane, played by fifty-one                   year-old Gary Cooper (it was his fifth and last career nomination                   - and his second Oscar win).\nMarlon Brando again lost the Academy Award for                   Best Actor (a second consecutive nomination in a career total                   of eight nominations) in his title role performance as the                   Mexican peasant revolutionary Emiliano Zapata in director Elia                   Kazan's Viva Zapata! (with five nominations and one                   win - Best Supporting Actor). [Brando had a third consecutive                   nomination in 1953 for Julius Caesar, and finally a                   winning nomination in 1954 for\nOn                   The Waterfront (1954) .]\nKirk Douglas (with his second of three unsuccessful                   career nominations) was also Best Actor-nominated for his role                   as Jonathan Shields, a ruthless Hollywood film producer in                   director Vincente Minnelli's The Bad                     and the Beautiful (with six nominations and five wins)                   told from the viewpoint of an actress, a writer, and a director.

                "KATY JURADO, PART 2 Program Notes - Austin Film Society\nDirector of Programming, Austin Film Society\n \nAfter the relative success of THE BULLFIGHTER AND THE LADY, Katy Jurado accepted the invitation to go to Hollywood in late 1951 to talk with screenwriter Carl Foreman, director Fred Zinnemann, and actor Gary Cooper about taking the role of Helen Ramírez in HIGH NOON. The chance to work with such a stellar director and actor made her accept the role despite her professed lack of interest in a Hollywood career. Just in case, she secured an agent, Paul Kohner, husband of Lupita Tovar, another Mexican expatriate actress in Hollywood. Not yet 25-years-old, but with seven years of acting experience, Katy Jurado stood on the edge of a second acting career – this time as a Hollywood star.\nAlthough she would have no scenes with Gary Cooper in HIGH NOON, they frequently talked, especially during the five weeks of rehearsal before a single shot was filmed. Jurado was well aware of Coop’s love of Lupe Vélez two decades earlier, but he was currently involved with actress Patricia Neal. Otherwise, who knows? Katy’s relationship with Grace Kelly was quite different – distant, if not cold. This was the first starring role for Grace Kelly, who had done a lot of TV work after leaving her modeling career in 1950. But Jurado, the established actress, was naturally billed above Kelly. What seemed to cause the problem between them was Jurado’s very direct way of looking into a person’s eyes as she spoke. The “stare” seemed to unnerve Grace, who would fumble her lines in the important scene with “Helen Ramírez.” Katy Jurado also classified Grace Kelly as a woman who acted weak and needy as a way of manipulating men all too eager to help her. Jurado was strong and willful and didn’t like that traditional feminine wile. When Katy saw that the camera was lovingly pointed at Grace even while Katy delivered her lines, she complained to Zinnemann who said that from then on, when Helen Ramírez spoke, the camera would be on Jurado. Doubtlessly widening the chasm between the two women was the fact that Jurado admittedly preferred the company and friendship of men rather than women. However, this iciness really worked out best for the film, because the former mistress and the new Quaker wife couldn’t possibly get along. Nonetheless, it is Jurado’s character who changes the course of the story by telling Kelly a woman should stand by her man.\nJurado’s scenes in her hotel room and in the buggy with Kelly were completed in two days. She was free to go back to Mexico to continue her career there. She had no idea that HIGH NOON would turn out to be one of the most iconic westerns ever made. After its premiere on 24 July 1952, the critics and audiences made it obvious this was an important picture. Before Oscar nominations in 1953, Jurado was called back from Mexico to accompany Cooper and Zinnemann on a publicity tour for the film. By then screenwriter Carl Foreman, already caught up in the House Un-American Committee witch-hunt for “Communists” in Hollywood, had left for Britain where he would first write SLEEPING TIGER for fellow black-listed director Joseph Losey. Foreman then wrote A HATFUL OF RAIN and THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI for Hollywood studios, but behind a front. Only much later would he receive credit for those screenplays. After writing THE KEY for Carol Reed in the UK, Foreman was finally brought back into the Hollywood fold as a credited screenwriter for THE GUNS OF NAVARRONE in 1961. He had been blacklisted for nearly a decade.\nDespite its association with Carl Foreman, HIGH NOON was nominated for best picture, best director, and best screenplay of 1952. Cooper won for best actor and the editor and composer also received Oscars. Though ignored by the Academy at this time, Katy Jurado, 25-years-old, would win a Golden Globe for “best supporting actress” in HIGH NOON. \n \nBack home in Mexico, Jurado made MUJER DE MEDIANOCHE (28 May 1952) and EL BRUTO, for which she received the Silver Ariel in Mexico for “best supporting actress.” 1952 was a great year for her with HIGH NOON and EL BRUTO and recognition for her acting in both the US and Mexico.\n \nHollywood definitely took note and asked her to come back to shoot SAN ANTONE (shot in California and released 15 February 1953), in which she received 4th billing as “Mistania Figueroa.” It was a post-Civil War film in which a former Union soldier drives cattle into Mexico as ransom for fifty prisoners held by a former Confederate officer. Jurado denied Hollywood stylists the right to change her hairstyles and makeup. She knew how she looked best (or more appropriate for a role). She was already showing her determined side. This film was quickly followed by ARROWHEAD (3 August 1953), in which she received 3rd billing. Shot in Bracketville, Texas, this film depicted chief-of-scouts Ed Bannon [Charlton Heston], “raised by Indians” but suspicious of a group of Apaches who seem ready to agree to a treaty which will move them to Florida [!]. Of course, the movie makes him “right” in his suspicions. Katy was given her first, but not last, role as a Native American. Filling the script with more suspicion, she was called upon to try to kill her lover, fail, and commit suicide. Katy returned to Mexico briefly to shoot TEHUANTEPEC (released in Mexico 7 October 1954) in which she played a blind woman who fell in love with the doctor who restored her sight.\nThen came the wonderful role of Señora Devereaux, the wife of Matt Devereaux (Spencer Tracy) in BROKEN LANCE (29 July 1954). Daughter of an Indian chief but passed off as a Mexican, Jurado’s character is the moral center of the film, negotiating the tension between the crusty old rancher/landowner and his older sons. BROKEN LANCE was a particularly outstanding example of the Freudian westerns of the 1950s. For her finely nuanced portrayal, Jurado was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, but the award went to Eva Marie Saint for ON THE WATERFRONT.\nLeaving Westerns behind for a while, Katy played the faithful wife of racecar driver Carlos Chávez (Cesar Romero) in THE RACERS (one of many – and always boring – racing car melodramas). It was released in the US 4 February 1955. Her next film TRIAL (7 October 1955), one that greatly impressed me at age 13, concerned a Mexican-American youth Angel Chávez, who was unjustly accused of the rape/murder of an Anglo girl. Communists try to exploit the case but Glenn Ford splits with the party members and defends Angel in a non-political way (or so I remember – it isn’t on DVD or VHS). Jurado played Angel’s sincere, emotional mother. It was a very gritty bit of American social-realism (and unabashed anti-Communism) at the time. \nKaty Jurado was flying so high by now that she was taken to Paris to co-star in TRAPEZE (30 May 1956) with Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, and Gina Lollobrigida in her American film debut. It was a behind-the-scenes look at the circus world – the loves, the rivalry, the betrayal. For authenticity it was shot at the Cirque d’Hiver in Paris. Jurado was completely in love with the glamour of the era: the limos, fine hotels, beautiful clothes, the nightclubs, gloves, hats, the etiquette and manners. She hated the later era of jeans and sneakers.\nAlong with her film work she made a number of TV appearances in the 50s in dramatic series like Playhouse 90 and Climax! [the producers’ exclamation point, not mine]. She also appeared in TV westerns like The Rifleman.\nThe TV work made returning to movie westerns easier, even after the glamour of Europe. MAN FROM DEL RIO (30 October 1956) was filmed in California. She played Estella, a decent woman who tries to love an outlaw-turned-sheriff (fellow Mexican actor Anthony Quinn) into respectability. In DRAGOON WELLS MASSACRE (28 April 1957) a wagon load of prisoners is being escorted through “dangerous Indian territory,” but I can’t find any information about Jurado’s role.\nThe following year she fatefully appeared in BADLANDERS (3 Sept 1958), which was filmed in California and Arizona. With third billing, principal female lead, she met co-star Ernest Borgnine, who played ex-con John McBain, lured into revenge and thievery by fellow cellmate “the Dutchman” (Alan Ladd). Jurado’s character Anita falls in love with McBain, as did Jurado and Borgnine.\nThey began an affair which took her out of movies for nearly 3 years. Only a couple of TV shows interrupted them. On 31 December 1959 they married in a ceremony in Cuernavaca, attended by her parents and her two children, now in their teens. The craggy-faced, rough-mannered man, who had won an Oscar for “best actor” in MARTY in 1955, seemed to be the love of her life and was for a while until the violence commenced, committed by both parties. She always maintained that the good memories outweighed the bad in that relationship, but vastly preferred the romance and the early part of the marriage – “the best years of her life.”\nBy late 1960 or early 1961 she felt it was time to return to her career. Marlon Brando invited her to be in his directorial debut (and directorial farewell), the much maligned but actually interesting ONE-EYED JACKS (30 March 1961). Perhaps it suffered from its pretentious advertising tagline: “The motion picture that starts its own tradition of greatness.” In this western, Brando plays Rio, who is tracking down conniving former partner, Dad Longworth. Rio wants to kill Dad for betraying him and leaving him to rot in prison, but gets at him through his daughter Louisa whom he seduces (oh, those Freudian westerns). Katy Jurado plays a very subdued role as the wife of Dad Longworth, with not much to do other than look concerned. She was worthier of much more but the script didn’t allow her much range or interest. However, out of this film came a long-lasting friendship with Brando, who indicated he wanted more of her, but had to settle for Jurado’s offer to be friends. She had done the same with Frank Sinatra. Other Hollywood friends at this time were Sammy Davis Jr, Burt Lancaster, and John Wayne.\nShe returned briefly to Mexico for a role in Y DIOS LA LLAMÓ TIERRA (released in Mexico 30 November 1961), directed by Carlos Toussaint, who had been a set designer on several Jurado films of the 40s, but this certainly didn’t mark a propitious return to the “cine Mexicano.” Instead, while she and Borgnine were still speaking to each other, the couple traveled to Europe to make two films. BARABBAS (released in Italy 23 December 1961 and in the US 10 October 1962), shot in Italy, was one of the ever-increasing number of runaway productions being filmed in Europe as the traditional Hollywood studio system was collapsing. Even with her small role as a madam/innkeeper, Jurado’s name was so well recognized in the international film world that she received 4th billing. Since her character was a Roman, she didn’t feel that she was betraying her vow not to play characters that made Mexican or Indian women look bad. Anthony Quinn gave a very fine performance as the man who tradition says was set free instead of Christ because of the mob’s wishes. It is an interesting film but not because of Jurado.  The second Italian film the couple did together was I BRIGANTI ITALIANI (4 May 1962), in which Jurado played Assunta Carbone, wife of a guerrilla bandit roaming the Italian countryside in the 1860s wars between Italian states. Reportedly this film was never shown theatrically in the US but did receive a TV release.\nAfter some more TV appearances in the US Jurado traveled to Mexico to be in LA BANDIDA (13 January 1963), set in a brothel during the Mexican revolution. Her co-star was the fearsome powerhouse Maria Felix. One can only assume a friendship did not arise between the two women. The relationship with Borgnine was also coming to an end. They finally divorced 3 June 1963. She never spoke ill of him. The same cannot be said for him.\nKaty Jurado then took another 3-year hiatus from filming. She had a lovely home in Cuernavaca and could enjoy her children and young grandchildren. But by 1966 she was ready to go to the US once a year to make films, starting with SMOKY (3 August 1966), about the famous horse beloved by readers since the 1930s, followed by A COVENANT WITH DEATH (15 February 1967), in which she was given the burden of playing the wife of George Maharis, and ending with STAY AWAY, JOE (8 March 1968), in which she happily played Elvis’s “Indian mother,” just as Dolores del Rio had done eight years earlier in FLAMING STAR. Jurado described “the King” as “a little boy who never grew up.”\nThen came a period of decline, starting with a Mexican horror film, followed by UN HOMBRE SOLO (shot in Spain by an unremarkable German director, co-starring nonentities, and released 24 May 1969). In 1970 she received 25th billing in FALTAS A LA MORAL. She was only 43 years old and seemed to be considered a has-been. Then the son of her former agent Paul Kohner came to her rescue. Pancho Kohner, just beginning his career as a producer, also decided to direct his first film (of two), THE BRIDGE IN THE JUNGLE, adapted from a story by the enigmatic B. Traven and shot in Chiapas, with John Huston as her co-star. However, without much international interest in that film, Jurado followed the path of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford into the realm of horror films, in Jurado’s case RANCHO DEL MIEDO, which had some scenes in the large Panteón de Dolores in Mexico City. It’s sad to think of her running through the cemetery screaming. \nA glimmer of hope came with her appearance in Peckinpah’s PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID (US release 23 May 1973). That was followed by a really good Mexican 3-story film, FE, ESPERANZA Y CARIDAD (Mexican release 14 February 1974), in which she appeared in the CARIDAD segment directed by rising star director Jorge Fons. To maintain her character she wouldn’t go home after each day’s shooting but would check into a hotel instead. She was ecstatic to be playing such a strong character again. Once blacklisted musical star Zero Mostel came to Mexico in 1974 to play the part of a cruel landowner in ONCE UPON A SCOUNDREL and Katy secured 2nd billing as one of the townspeople struggling against the tyrant.\nVarious other unremarkable Mexican films followed, but then came LOS ALBAÑILES (Mexican release 23 December 1976), one of the more important Mexican films of the cinematically exploding 1970s. Although billed only sixth, Jurado had the lead female role, since the film was focused on the male construction workers and their struggles with corrupt police and bosses. This came out during a period of extreme social consciousness in the Mexican film industry. \nJurado received top billing in EL ELEGIDO, a thriller in 1977, and came to the US to do an episode of Baretta, the Robert Blake TV show. She co-starred with Anthony Quinn and Dolores del Rio in THE CHILDREN OF SANCHEZ (US release 22 November 1978). And then came another fortunate offer: LA SEDUCCIÓN (Mexican release 27 May 1982), directed by Arturo Ripstein (whom  AFS  brought to Austin for a retrospective in 2003). Jurado had actually known Ripstein since he was a small child being brought to the studio by his father, producer Alfredo Ripstein, in the 1940s when she was working constantly in the Mexican film industry. She said of the adult director that he was very hard and difficult. Others have said that in the 80s and 90s he was “a shouter” on the set (like Oliver Stone). Nonetheless, she enjoyed working with a noted director again. \n \nWhile shooting a boxing movie BARRIO DE CAMPEONES in 1981, Jurado received word that her son Victor Hugo had been killed in an auto accident in Montemorelos, Nuevo León, her parents’ hometown. His car had pulled up to a stop sign and was hit by a speeding bus. Jurado was devastated and withdrew from film and TV for nearly three years. She began drinking heavily, showed no interest in life or friendship, and even stopped caring for her appearance. She became quite overweight and smoked incessantly, which caused chronic bronchitis. She spent months in a hospital in Monterrey and underwent various operations. \nBut her previous co-star John Huston brought her out of her dark cave in 1984 by offering her a role in UNDER THE VOLCANO, based on the fascinating novel by Malcolm Lowry and shot in Cuernavaca, so Katy didn’t even need to travel to participate in the film. More TV work followed in Mexico and the US, but mostly she enjoyed her grandchildren and her home in Cuernavaca. \nBut in late 1997 Arturo Ripstein knocked at her door again. The by-now world-famous director asked Jurado to play “Mamá Dorita” in his surreal film EL EVANGELIO DE LAS MARAVILLAS, which would appear in many international film festivals. The 70-year-old Jurado played the leader of a small religious community awaiting the second coming of Christ. Mamá Dorita finally decides that Christ has come back as a young girl, Tomasa. Katy Jurado loved this role because it was so different from any she had played before. Working with Ripstein on this second film, 15 years after LA SEDUCCIÓN, she found that he had mellowed somewhat and become more humane.\nFor her final performance for the American film industry Jurado traveled to New Mexico to take a small role in Stephen Frears’ THE HI-LO COUNTRY in 1998. Finally, right before her death in 2002, she played the starring role in UN SECRETO DE ESPERANZA, a semi-biographical film about the friendship between an elderly woman and her grandson during two periods of his life, 12 and 29 years-of-age. Jurado’s actual grandson Joaquín Jurado, who has become a rather successful musician, is certain the movie is about the times he spent with his grandmother. UN SECRETO DE ESPERANZA would be Jurado’s sweet farewell to viewers who had watched her for nearly 60 years.\n \nEarly in life Katy Jurado had showed impressive strength of will, at a time that not many women could speak out. She insisted, “No one steps on me and the one who tries had better be a brave man.” She was proud that her climb up the ladder of success didn’t depend on any lovers or “padrinos.” She was equally proud that her life contained no scandals. Married just twice, she had the joys of having two children and the sorrow of losing one. But Victor Hugo and daughter Sandra provided eight grandchildren. She was also a benefactor of the poor in Cuernavaca. Without making a big deal of her kindness, she paid for the construction of schools for the poor children in the neighborhood surrounding her beloved home. She enjoyed the countryside, stayed away from cities as much as possible in later life, loved her family, and after getting over the tragedy of losing her son, seems to have had a very lovely life right up until the end. For us she left a wonderful legacy of fascinating personalities in a huge catalog of films.  \n \nKaty Jurado, Somos Uno (revista), n.d.\nIMDB.com, various Katy Jurado films",

                "Grace Kelly's Biography | Grace Kelly Online\nGrace Kelly's Biography\nWe also have Trivia about Grace and maps of important locations in Grace's life .\nGrace Patricia Kelly (12 November 1929–14 September 1982) was a beautiful Oscar-winning actress, fashion icon, and princess of Monaco.\nGrace Patricia Kelly was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to John and Margaret Kelly.  John B. Kelly was a wealthy contractor.  At a young age, Grace decided she wanted to become an actress, and studied acting (primarily theater) at New York City's American Academy of Dramatic Art and worked as a stage actress and model before moving to Hollywood. When in New York, Grace promoted Old Gold cigarettes and appeared on the covers of magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Redbook.\nGrace debuted in the film 14 Hours , in a minor supporting role, but then starred in High Noon , in which she played a \"mousey\" Quaker bride.  Grace then appeared in Mogambo , which won her an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.  Her work in High Noon and a screen test for the film Taxi piqued the interest of director Alfred Hitchcock, who, with the aid of Edith Head, pruned Grace into his ideal of the elegant, beautiful blonde. She gave Hitchcock wonderful performances in Dial M for Murder , Rear Window , and To Catch a Thief . Grace went against Hitchcock's glamorized vision of her for the film The Country Girl , which won her the Golden Globe and the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role of 1954. The success of the song \" True Love \" from the movie High Society earned Grace a gold record. In 1956, she was voted the Golden Globe's World Film Favorite Actor, Female.\nLater that year, she married Prince Rainier Grimaldi III of Monaco to become Her Serene Highness Princess Grace of Monaco. As a princess, she gave up her successful acting career, in which she had made eleven films. She had three children: Princess Caroline, Prince Albert, and Princess Stéphanie. Grace died on 14 September 1982 after her car went off a road in the cliffs of Monaco.\nInformation for this biography was taken from these sources ."

                "Regent Street is one of the major shopping streets in the West End of London, well known to tourists and locals alike and famous for its Christmas illuminations. It is named after the Prince Regent (later George IV) and is commonly associated with the architect John Nash, whose street layout survives, although all of his original buildings except All Souls Church have since been replaced.\n\nThe street was completed in 1825 and was an early example of town planning in England, cutting through the 17th and 18th century street pattern through which it passes. It runs from the Regent's residence at Carlton House in St James's at the southern end, through Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Circus, to All Souls Church. From there Langham Place and Portland Place continue the route to Regent's Park.\n\nAlthough none of the original 1825 Nash buildings (save for the church) remain (the Regency buildings were all demolished between 1897 and 1925) every building in Regent Street is protected as a listed building with at least Grade II status, and together they form the Regent Street Conservation Area. \n\nHistory\n\nBeginnings: 1811–1825\n\nRegent Street is one of the first planned developments of London. The desire to impose order on the medieval street pattern of London dates back to the Great Fire of London (1666) when Sir Christopher Wren drew up plans for rebuilding the city on the classical formal model, but that initiative was lost. It was not until 1811 that John Nash drew up plans for broad, architecturally distinguished thoroughfares and public spaces: Carlton House Terrace on The Mall, Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street and Regent's Park with its grand terraces. The Regent's Development is considered one of the first garden suburbs and involved extending London into its rural periphery by combining residential development, with public open space, and new infrastructure in the form of a system of canals.  The plans were prepared under the authority of the Office of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, which since 1793 invited designs for Regent's Park, and came to the conclusion that the Park must have a proper road connecting it with the fashionable area around Charing Cross. Nash's plans were submitted to Parliament for approval.\n\nWhile the park terraces are residential, Regent Street was intended for commercial purposes and consequently did not need gardens or public spaces. The scale of the development was unprecedented in London. The street followed the line of existing roads, and detoured to make efficient use of land belonging to the government. Nonetheless, much demolition was necessary, and many freehold and leasehold interests had to be bought out at current property values. It is thought that the Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, including Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year leases, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.\n\nThe design was adopted by Act of Parliament in 1813, and built between 1814 and 1825. The individual buildings were designed by Charles Robert Cockerell, Sir John Soane and Nash himself, among others. At first called New Street, it became a dividing line between Soho, which had become less than respectable, and the fashionable squares and streets of Mayfair to the west.\n\nRebuilding: 1895–1927\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, fashions in shopping had changed and the original buildings were unsuitable for their purpose. They were small and old fashioned, and consequently they were restricting trade. A colonnade constructed by Nash was demolished in the mid-19th century for fear it might attract \"doubtful characters\". In the Edwardian era, department stores were the principal commercial aspiration. Dickins & Jones, Garrard & Co., Swan and Edgar, Hamleys and Liberty & Co. date from this period although only the last two are still there.\n\nFurther, Nash’s buildings were not of the highest quality, using stucco render and composition to imitate stonework; and many of the buildings had been considerably extended and were now structurally suspect. As the 99-year leases came to an end, Regent Street was redeveloped between 1895 and 1927 under the control of the Office of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues (now the Crown Estate).\n\nRegent Street as we see it today is the result of this redevelopment. South of Oxford Circus, none of the original buildings survive except for some Nash-designed sewers. The current street's design is an example of the Beaux Arts approach to urban design: an assembly of separate buildings on a grand scale, designed to harmonise and produce an impressive overall effect. Strict rules were put in place to govern the reconstruction. Each block was required to be designed with a continuous unifying façade to the street, had to be finished in Portland stone, and with a uniform cornice level 66 feet above pavement level, excluding dormers, turrets and mansard roofs. The first redevelopment was Regent House, just south of Oxford Circus. However, the stylistic tone for the rebuilding was set by Reginald Blomfield's Quadrant.\n\nRegent Street became the first shopping area in Britain to support late night opening in 1850, when shopkeepers agreed to keep stores open until 7pm.\n\nThe Quadrant was the subject of considerable debate. The unity of Piccadilly Circus had been upset by the construction of Shaftesbury Avenue, and the first proposals were unsatisfactory. At the age of 73, the eminent architect Norman Shaw was brought in to resolve the design, and drew up proposals for the Circus and the Quadrant which were approved in principle, but still subject to indecision and dispute, both on property acquisition matters, and the retailers' demand for bigger display windows. Shaw's design for the Piccadilly Hotel was completed in 1908 with severe modifications. Reconstruction of the Quadrant was finally carried out by Sir Reginald Blomfield, who adapted and arguably watered-down Shaw's designs. Building works started in 1923 and completed in 1928.\n\nA limited number of architects were responsible for the design of the reconstructed Regent Street. Other architects involved were Sir John James Burnet, Arthur Joseph Davis and Henry Tanner.\n\nThe work was delayed by the Great War and it was not until 1927 that the completion was celebrated, with King George V and Queen Mary driving in state along its length.\n\nCrown Estate redevelopment\n\nMost of Regent Street, apart from two blocks at the northern end near Langham Place, is owned by the Crown Estate. In 2013 the Crown Estate sold 25% of the 270,000 sq ft Regent Street Quadrant 3 building to the Norwegian Oil Fund.  Since the turn of the Millennium, the Crown Estate has embarked on a major redevelopment programme in Regent Street and some of its side streets. Early 20th century offices, which typically have many corridors and small individual offices, have been replaced with modern, flexible open plan accommodation. Some of the smaller shops were replaced with larger units.\nThe largest element of the plan is the reconstruction of the Quadrant at the southern end of the street close to Piccadilly Circus. In addition to shops and offices, a five star hotel and a small number of flats will be created here.\nThe Crown Estate moved its own headquarters from Carlton House Terrace to Regent Street in 2006.\n\nSelected shops and other places of note\n\nAll Souls Church\n\nAll Souls Church, Langham Place, at the top of Regent Street next to Broadcasting House, is a church with a distinctive circular portico surmounted by a stone spire. Completed in 1823 and consecrated in 1824, All Souls is the only surviving building in Regent Street that was designed by John Nash.\n\nApple Store\n\nThe Apple retail store opened on Regent Street on 20 November 2004. At the time this was the first such store in Europe, the others being in the United States and Japan. It was the largest Apple store worldwide until the opening of the even larger Covent Garden store in August 2010.\n\nBroadcasting House\n\nThe BBC's headquarters are in Broadcasting House, whose front entrance is in Langham Place, marking the top end of Regent Street. Several national radio stations broadcast from this 1930s Art Deco building. The exterior, built of Portland stone, features a sculpture by Eric Gill over the front entrance. The new BBC Egton Wing, designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, is the most visible face of a large-scale rebuilding project to modernise the site and replace earlier extensions to Broadcasting House.\n\nCafé Royal\n\nThe Café Royal, located at 68 Regent Street in the Quadrant, opened in 1865 and became an institution of London high society. The present building, by Sir Reginald Blomfield, dates from 1928 and is grade 2 listed. The Café Royal closed in December 2008, as part of Crown Estate plans to redevelop this part of Regent Street. \n\nDickins & Jones\n\nIn June 2005, owner House of Fraser announced that the department store Dickins & Jones, which traces its origins to 1803 and had been located in Regent Street since 1835, would close in January 2006. The store was making losses for several years and failed to keep up with more fashion-conscious rivals such as its neighbour Liberty. The building has been redeveloped with small shop units on the lower floors and flats and offices above. \n\nHamleys\n\nHamleys toy shop is 100 metres south of Oxford Circus on the east side of the road. Originally located in Holborn and named Noah's Ark, the Regent Street store opened in 1881 and has been at the present address since 1981. It claims to be the largest toy shop in the world. \n\nHollister Co./Gilly Hicks\n\nThe original occupier of the Abercrombie & Fitch Hollister Co. and Gilly Hicks store was a flagship National Geographic shop at 83–97 Regent Street, it is a flagship store for Hollister Co. and Gilly Hicks first international flagship store.\n\nLiberty\n\nThe Liberty department store was originally known for its role at the retail end of the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts Movement styles. Set up by the entrepreneur Arthur Lasenby Liberty, who took out a loan for £2000 in 1874 and purchased 218a Regent Street. The shop opened in 1875 with only three staff. Lasenby’s shop sold ornaments, fabric and objects of art from Japan and the East. In the 1920s the now iconic Tudor-style building was designed and built by architects Edwin T. Hall and his son Edwin S. Hall, constructed from the timbers of two ships, the HMS Impregnable, and the HMS Hindustan. The original building is on Great Marlborough Street, not on Regent Street. There are bridges across Kingly Street, connecting to the adjacent stone-faced building which once gave Liberty a frontage on Regent Street, but the store no longer occupies this annexe. Liberty's shop windows are famous for their inventive window-dressing, especially the annual Christmas displays.\n\nOxford Circus tube station\n\nOxford Circus is the junction where Regent Street crosses Oxford Street, and the site of one of the busiest of London's underground stations. The Central, Bakerloo and Victoria lines all meet here.\n\nParis Theatre\n\nParis Theatre was located in Lower Regent Street, near other BBC buildings and was a place of performance of the well-known rock groups and was the venue for the recording of radio shows before live audiences,\n\nSuperdry\n\nThe Superdry store was originally Austin Reed's flagship store for more than 85 years was located at 103–113 Regent Street. The store had an atrium at its centre, housing glass lifts allowing viewing across all floors. The lower ground floor sold womenswear and also housed Austin's, the refurbished 1920s Art Deco Barber Shop, offering a full range of hair, face and body treatments for both men and women.\n\nIn May 2011, reports surfaced that British fashion retailer Superdry was to move into the building occupied by Austin Reed, which in turn was to move across the road into Aquascutum. Superdry reportedly paid £12m for the lease.\n\nIn late 2011, Austin Reed re-launched at 100 Regent Street, while Superdry officially opened at 103–113 Regent Street on 17 December 2011.\n\nThe Sting\n\nThe former Tower Records and Virgin Megastore store on Regent Street is now occupied by Dutch fashion retailer The Sting.\n\nUniversity of Westminster\n\nFounded in 1838 under George Cayley and rebuilt under Quintin Hogg (merchant) in 1911, the University of Westminster's flagship Regent Street campus stands as one of the oldest educational institutions of the city.  Historically, the University was once also titled as the Royal Polytechnic Institution (after a royal charter had been formally received in August 1839 and Prince Albert became a patron to the institution). Other names include, \"The Polytechnic at Regent Sreet\" and the Polytechnic of Central London (PCL). The University houses the Regent Street Cinema which acted as a platform for many major scientists, artists and authors such as Charles Dickens,  John Henry Pepper,  and The Lumière Brothers (Auguste and Louis Lumière) where public and private screenings of Cinématographe were shown to an audience.  The cinema has undergone restoration and is open to the public again as the Regent Street Cinema. \n\nEvents\n\nThere is a yearly Regent Street Festival when the street is closed to traffic for the day. \n\nThe Christmas light displays are a London tradition dating since 1948, when the Regent Street Association decorated the street with Christmas trees. Lighting was not allowed until 1949, following lifting of wartime restrictions, and the first full lighting display was in 1953. There is a different display every year, switched on at an opening ceremony in the first week of November.\n\nOn 6 July 2004, half a million people crowded into Regent Street and the surrounding streets to watch a parade of Formula One cars.Transport\nThe nearest London Underground stations are Oxford Circus (Bakerloo, Central and Victoria lines) at its northern end, and Piccadilly Circus (Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines) at its southern end.",
                "Bond Street in the West End of London, connects Piccadilly in the south to Oxford Street in the north. The street, consisting of two sections, has been a popular shopping area since the 18th century and is the home of many fashion outlets that sell prestigious and expensive items. The southern section is Old Bond Street and the longer northern section New Bond Street—a distinction not generally made in everyday usage.\n\nThe street was originally fields surrounding Clarendon House on Piccadilly, which were developed by Sir Thomas Bond. It was built up in the 1720s, and by the end of the 18th century was a popular place for the upper-class residents of Mayfair to socialise. Prestigious and expensive shops were established along the street but it declined as a centre of social activity in the 19th century, although it held its reputation as a fashionable place for retail, and is home to the auction houses Sotheby's and Bonhams (formerly Phillips) and the department stores Fenwick and Tiffany's. It is one of the most expensive and sought after strips of real estate in Europe.\n\nGeography\n\nBond Street is the only street that runs between Oxford Street and Piccadilly. Old Bond Street is at the southern end between Piccadilly and Burlington Gardens. The northern section, New Bond Street, extends as far as Oxford Street. The whole street combined is around  long.  The street is narrow, and many of the shops along its front are less than 20 ft wide.\n\nThe nearest tube stations are Green Park on Piccadilly, and Bond Street station on Oxford Street. Despite its name, the station does not directly connect to either New or Old Bond Street. No bus routes use the street, though the C2 service crosses New Bond Street.  Part of New Bond Street is classified B406; the remainder and all of Old Bond Street has no number.  New Bond Street is pedestrianised between Grafton Street and Clifford Street to prevent through traffic and to stop the road being used as a rat run.\n\nHistory\n\nThere has been evidence of Roman settlement around what is now Bond Street. In 1894, a culvert made from brick and stone was discovered in the area.  The street was named after Sir Thomas Bond, the head of a syndicate of developers who purchased a Piccadilly mansion called Clarendon House, from Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle in 1686, and proceeded to demolish the house and develop the area. At that time, the house backed onto open fields, known as Albemarle Ground, and the development of various estates in Mayfair had just begun.\n\nNew Bond Street was added during a second phase of construction 14 years after Bond's syndicate began developing the area. Most of the building along the street occurred in the 1720s, on what was the Conduit Mead Estate. John Rocque's map of London, published in 1746, shows properties along the entire length of Bond Street, including the fully constructed side streets. The two parts of the street have always had separate names, and a plan by the council to merge the two into a singular \"Bond Street\" in the 1920s were rejected by locals.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the street began to become popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair. Shop owners let out the upstairs for residential purposes, attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift, George Selwyn, William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Stern. In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycotted Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox, causing him to lose his seat in parliament and dissolve the Fox–North Coalition. She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets, and encouraged people to go to Bond Street. Consequently, the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair. By the end of the century, an upper class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared, wearing expensive wigs and parading up and down the street in a pretentious manner.\n\nLord Nelson stayed at temporary lodgings on New Bond Street between 1797–8, and again in 1811–13. Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford lived on Bond Street and was unhappy about the presence of the Bond Street Loungers. Already notorious for a violent and abusive temper, on 7 October 1801, he refused invitations to join in celebrations of peace between Britain and France (which led to the Treaty of Amiens), resulting in an altercation with several Loungers at his doorstep. Camelford retreated upstairs and fired upon the crowd with a pistol.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Bond Street became less known for its social atmosphere and increased its reputation as a street for luxury shopping. The auctioneer Phillips was established in 1796 at No. 101 Bond Street, specialising in stringed instruments and sheet music. The jewellers Asprey originally opened in 1830 at Nos. 165–169 New Bond Street. The Jewish practice of Kabbalah has been associated with the street after former East End trader Sarah Levenson opened a shop on No. 50 New Bond Street in 1856 and immediately became profitable, albeit through exaggerated and questionable product claims. Levenson was twice taken to court and prosecuted for fraud, each resulting in a five-year prison sentence. She died mid-way through the second. Nevertheless, the practice regained popularity and a Kabbalah Centre remains on the street.\n\nThe Royal Arcade links Old Bond Street with Albemarle Street. It was originally proposed in 1864 as a longer link between Old Bond Street and Regent Street, but this was rejected due to the scale of proposed demolition and restricting access to existing properties.  It was subsequently redesigned to its current layout, opening in 1879 and replacing the Clarendon Hotel, which had been demolished in 1870. \n\nThe street has maintained its reputation for luxury shopping into the 21st century, and has on occasions been regarded as the best retail location in Europe.  In 2011, Bloomberg Business reported that New Bond Street was the most expensive retail street in Europe after the Champs-Élysées in Paris. As a consequence, though, the street has suffered from armed robbery on numerous occasions, with thieves being attracted by the high value of goods that can be stolen in raids. The Graff Diamonds robbery in Bond Street in 2009 resulted in an estimated loss of £40 million.   \n\nProperties\n\nWestminster City Council have said that Bond Street has the highest density of haute couture stores anywhere in the world, attracting \"the rich, the famous, and the simply curious\". The entire length of Bond Street has been part of the Mayfair Conservation Area controlled by Westminster City Council since 1969. Building alterations and constructions are tightly controlled to ensure the street's appearance and upkeep are unaltered. Many buildings are listed. The council regulates the style and materials used on shop front advertising.\n\nAt one time, Bond Street was best known for top-end art dealers and antique shops that were clustered around the London office of Sotheby's auction house—which has been at Nos. 34–35 Bond Street since 1917  and the Fine Art Society, founded in 1876. The sculpture over the entrance to Sotheby's is from Ancient Egypt and is believed to date from around 1600BC. It is the oldest outdoor sculpture in London.\n\nSome dealers and antique shops remain, but many of the shops became occupied by fashion boutiques, some of which are branches of global designer brands. The street still has a reputation as a fashionable place for shopping, including the flagship stores for Ralph Lauren and Cartier. Fenwick have had a department store on Bond Street since 1891. The Phillips building at No. 101 is still used for auctions; the company was bought by Bonhams in 2001 and subsequently spent £30 million expanding and refurbishing the premises. In 2015, Valentino announced plans to build a new flagship store on Old Bond Street. \n\nThe street features \"Allies\", a statue of Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who are portrayed sitting on a park bench in conversation, sculpted by Lawrence Holofcener. The statue, popular with tourists, was unveiled in May 1995 by Princess Margaret and was erected by the Bond Street Association to commemorate 50 years since the end of World War II. In 2013, maquettes of the sculpture (which are replicas, as Holofcener did not make any as part of the original artwork or design) were sold at Bonhams. \n\nThe construction of Crossrail, part of which runs between Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road stations, involved demolition of property in nearby Hanover Square, some of which backs onto New Bond Street. This affected Nos. 64–72, which required refurbishment. \n\nCultural references\n\nBond Street has been mentioned in several works of literature, including Jane Austen's novel Sense and Sensibility and Virginia Woolf's 1925 novel Mrs Dalloway.  The plot of the 1948 film Bond Street centres around items purchased from shops on the street.  In Suzanna Clarke's novel Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, Bond Street is described as having \"the most fashionable shops in all the kingdom\".\n\nBond Street is also a square on the British Monopoly board, and is the most expensive of the green-coloured set that also includes Regent and Oxford Streets. The three streets are grouped together because of their shared history in shopping and retail."

                "Colonial Crafts  1607-1776\nSCAVELMAN - one who kept the waterways and ditches clear\nWAINWRIGHT - one who built or repaired wagons\nWHEELWRIGHT - a person who repaired and made wheels and wheeled vehicles\nThis list of colonial crafts just barely scratches the surface. Back in those days everybody had a specialty. And you can bet they were good at what they did.\nLet’s look at the importance of the colonial crafts, trades and arts. The things you needed back then would be somewhat the things you need today (except for the X-Box 360):  Shelter, food, water, and sooner or later medical care.\nSo the neighbors helped you get the log walls cut and stacked up for the house.   But you need a roof, and for that you need a “Shingler”.  This person made shakes, and the good ones were cedar. He did his work on a break and vice with axe, saw and draw knife. It was long and tedious work. As you can imagine one house would use up a lot. You would need a blacksmith because iron nails would be needed.\nIn the 1700’s settlers would burn the house down when they moved so as to reclaim nails and any ironwork that was used in the construction.\nIron was that important.  Colonial craftsmen wasted very little, and actually were pretty good recyclers.  Incidentally iron back then was “wrought iron” and was a porous metal that had a lot of slag in it.  Not very strong but very easy to forge.  It was an important material to say the least. “Wrought” literally means to work by hand. Thus wrought iron was forged from a bloom of iron and slag, by hand.\nComposition of Wrought iron= 99–99.8%/Iron; 0.05–0.25%/Carbon; 0.01–0.1%/Manganese; 0.02–0.1%/Sulfur; 0.05–0.2%/Phosphorous, and 0.02–0.2%/Silicon.\nThe colonial craftsmen and tradesmen would have to make sure they were done crafting their shelters by winter. That oversight was the single most critical reason for some failures in New England.\nWell one would need clothing, plates, bowls, cooking utensils, some sort of storage for foodstuffs, and lighting (oil or candles).\nIf the lighting choice is an oil lantern, then a tinsmith or brightsmith would be required to make the lamp. If its candle, you would probably make those your self.\nGenerally, the women made candles in the fall. That’s when the butchering was done. They rendered tallow and that makes for some smelly candles. But at least you would have light.\nDid Ben Franklin say “early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise”?   I suppose Deborah (Ben’s wife) didn’t want to smell the candles.  And that is more likely why they were in bed early. And if Deborah is happy, that’s healthy and wise for Ben!\nYou would need a Cooper to make barrels to store your grains and foodstuffs. Storage would be of extreme importance as winter is coming.  Don’t forget, mice have to eat also and the food you stored would suit them fine. It would have been very important that mice and insects be kept out of the food!\nMost women did their own sewing, but they bought a lot of their material. A Milliner was a woman who bought and sold cloth and clothing.  She would need a spinner and a weaver as well. It’s easy to see how everyone’s lives were tied together.\nSo now you need shoes. Moccasins were big in those days. The men made them out of whatever hides they had. Deer were the most common. For a little more upscale one would use a Cobbler. This was truly a colonial craft, as it is today. The Cobbler used mostly cowhide for shoes.\nMost of the children followed in their parents’ footsteps.  If your father was a Carpenter you were a Carpenter.  If he was an Apothecary then chances are you would end up being a druggist too.  I can only imagine what the women would think if they would know what handmade soap and quilts were worth today.  I doubt they would believe it.\nSo from humble beginnings, colonial crafts turned into American industry and 100 years after that it went crazy around here. But that’s another story.\nThey say small business and small industry is the backbone of America. Believe me, you can't get much closer to this truth than when you're with the great Craftsmen and Artists that we'll introduce you to on this website.  Until we meet again, remember, American Manufacturing is alive and well at Brothers-Handmade. Come see what your neighbors are making.",
                "Colonial Occupations\nSearch billions of records on Ancestry.com\nCOLONIAL OCCUPATIONS\nOur early American colonists did not have quite the same employment opportunities as we do today.  There were no TV producers, car salesmen, rocket scientists, and certainly no computer programmers.  The first emigrants to America had occupations concerned primarily with simple, basic survival in the New World.  They were, for the most part, skilled laborers, who could make things most of us now only dabble in as hobbies.\nSome occupational names were self-explanatory such as a blacksmith, locksmith, and gunsmith.

                "The Muses  (, Moũsai; perhaps from the o-grade of the Proto-Indo-European root *men- \"think\" ) in Greek mythology are the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts. They were considered the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, lyric songs, and myths that were related orally for centuries in these ancient cultures. They were later adopted by the Romans as a part of their pantheon.\n\nIn current English usage, \"muse\" can refer in general to a person who inspires an artist, writer, or musician. \n\nNumber and names \n\nThe earliest known records of the Nine Muses are from Boeotia, the homeland of Hesiod. Some ancient authorities thought that the Nine Muses were of Thracian origin.  There, a tradition persisted that the Muses had once been three in number.  In the first century BC, Diodorus Siculus quotes Hesiod to the contrary, observing:\n\nWriters similarly disagree also concerning the number of the Muses; for some say that there are three, and others that there are nine, but the number nine has prevailed since it rests upon the authority of the most distinguished men, such as Homer and Hesiod and others like them. \n\nDiodorus also states (Book I.18) that Osiris first recruited the nine Muses, along with the Satyrs or male dancers, while passing through Ethiopia, before embarking on a tour of all Asia and Europe, teaching the arts of cultivation wherever he went. According to Hesiod's account (c. 600 BC), generally followed by the writers of antiquity, the Nine Muses were the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (i. e. \"Memory\" personified), figuring as personifications of knowledge and the arts, especially literature, dance and music.\n\nThe Roman scholar Varro (116–27 BC) relates that there are only three Muses: one who is born from the movement of water, another who makes sound by striking the air, and a third who is embodied only in the human voice. They were again called Melete or \"Practice\", Mneme or \"Memory\" and Aoide or \"Song\". Three ancient Muses were also reported in Plutarch's (46–120 AD) Quaestiones Convivales  (9.I4.2–4). \n\nHowever, the classical understanding of the muses  tripled their triad, and established a set of nine goddesses, who embody the arts and inspire creation with their graces through remembered and improvised song and mime, writing, traditional music, and dance. It was not until Hellenistic times that the following systematic set of functions was assigned to them, and even then there was some variation in both their names and their attributes: Calliope (epic poetry), Clio (history), Euterpe (flutes and lyric poetry), Thalia (comedy and pastoral poetry), Melpomene (tragedy), Terpsichore (dance), Erato (love poetry), Polyhymnia (sacred poetry), Urania (astronomy).\n\nAccording to Pausanias in the later second century AD,  there were three original Muses, worshiped on Mount Helicon in Boeotia: Aoidḗ (\"song\" or \"tune\"), Melétē (\"practice\" or \"occasion\"), and Mnḗmē (\"memory\"). Together, these three form the complete picture of the preconditions of poetic art in cult practice. In Delphi three Muses were worshiped as well, but with other names: Nḗtē, Mésē, and Hýpatē, which are assigned as the names of the three chords of the ancient musical instrument, the lyre. Alternatively they later were called Kēphisṓ, Apollōnís, and Borysthenís, which names characterize them as daughters of Apollo. In later tradition, a set of four Muses were recognized: Thelxinóē, Aoidḗ Archē, and Melétē, said to be daughters of Zeus and Plusia or of Uranus.\n\nOne of the people frequently associated with the Muses was Pierus. By some he was called the father (by a Pimpleian nymph, called Antiope by Cicero) of a total of seven Muses, called Neilṓ (Νειλώ), Tritṓnē (Τριτώνη), Asōpṓ (Ἀσωπώ), Heptápora (Ἑπτάπορα), Achelōís, Tipoplṓ (Τιποπλώ), and Rhodía (Ῥοδία). \n\nMythology \n\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony (seventh century BC), they were daughters of Zeus, the second generation king of the gods, and the offspring of Mnemosyne, goddess of memory. For Alcman and Mimnermus, they were even more primordial, springing from the early deities, Uranus and Gaia. Gaia is Mother Earth, an early mother goddess who was worshipped at Delphi from prehistoric times, long before the site was rededicated to Apollo, possibly indicating a transfer to association with him after that time.\n\nSometimes the Muses are referred to as water nymphs, associated with the springs of Helicon and with Pieris. It was said that the winged horse Pegasus touched his hooves to the ground on Helicon, causing four sacred springs to burst forth, from which the muses were born.  Athena later tamed the horse and presented him to the muses. (Compare the Roman inspiring nymphs of springs, the Camenae, the Völva of Norse Mythology and also the apsaras in the mythology of classical India.)\n\nClassical writers set Apollo as their leader, Apollon Mousagetēs (\"Apollo Muse-leader\").  In one myth, the Muses judged a contest between Apollo and Marsyas. They also gathered the pieces of the dead body of Orpheus, son of Calliope, and buried them. In a later myth, Thamyris challenged them to a singing contest. They won and punished Thamyris by blinding him and robbing him of his singing ability.\n\nAccording to a myth from Ovid's Metamorphoses—alluding to the connection of the Muses with Pieria—King Pierus, king of Macedon, had nine daughters he named after the nine Muses, believing that their skills were a great match to the Muses. He thus challenged the Muses to a match, resulting in his daughters, the Pierides, being turned into chattering magpies for their presumption. \n\nPausanias records a tradition of two generations of Muses; the first are the daughters of Uranus and Gaia, the second of Zeus and Mnemosyne. Another, rarer genealogy is that they are daughters of Harmonia (the daughter of Aphrodite and Ares), which contradicts the myth in which they were dancing at the wedding of Harmonia and Cadmus.\n\nEmblems\n\nSome Greek writers give the names of the nine Muses as Kallichore, Helike, Eunike, Thelxinoë, Terpsichore, Euterpe, Eukelade, Dia, and Enope. \n\nIn Renaissance and Neoclassical art, the dissemination of emblem books such as Cesare Ripa's Iconologia (1593 and many further editions) helped standardize the depiction of the Muses in sculpture and painting, so they could be distinguished by certain props. These props, or emblems, became readily identifiable by the viewer, enabling one immediately to recognize the Muse and the art with which they had become associated. Here again, Calliope (epic poetry) carries a writing tablet; Clio (history) carries a scroll and books; Euterpe (song and elegiac poetry) carries a flute, the aulos; Erato (lyric poetry) is often seen with a lyre and a crown of roses; Melpomene (tragedy) is often seen with a tragic mask; Polyhymnia (sacred poetry) is often seen with a pensive expression; Terpsichore (choral dance and song) is often seen dancing and carrying a lyre; Thalia (comedy) is often seen with a comic mask; and Urania (astronomy) carries a pair of compasses and the celestial globe.\n\nFunctions\n\nIn society\n\nGreek mousa is a common noun as well as a type of goddess: it literally means \"art\" or \"poetry\". According to Pindar, to \"carry a mousa\" is \"to excel in the arts\". The word probably derives from the Indo-European root men-, which is also the source of Greek Mnemosyne, English \"mind\", \"mental\" and \"memory\" and Sanskrit \"mantra\".\n\nThe Muses, therefore, were both the embodiments and sponsors of performed metrical speech: mousike (whence the English term \"music\") was just \"one of the arts of the Muses\". Others included Science, Geography, Mathematics, Philosophy, and especially Art, Drama, and inspiration. In the archaic period, before the widespread availability of books (scrolls), this included nearly all of learning. The first Greek book on astronomy, by Thales, took the form of dactylic hexameters, as did many works of pre-Socratic philosophy. Both Plato and the Pythagoreans explicitly included philosophy as a sub-species of mousike.  The Histories of Herodotus, whose primary medium of delivery was public recitation, were divided by Alexandrian editors into nine books, named after the nine Muses.\n\nFor poet and \"law-giver\" Solon,  the Muses were \"the key to the good life\"; since they brought both prosperity and friendship. Solon sought to perpetuate his political reforms by establishing recitations of his poetry—complete with invocations to his practical-minded Muses—by Athenian boys at festivals each year. He believed that the muses would help inspire people to do their best.\n\nInvoking the Muse in literature\n\nAncient authors and their imitators invoke Muses when writing poetry, hymns or epic history. The invocation occurs near the beginning of their work. It asks for help or inspiration from the Muses, or simply invites the Muse to sing directly through the author.\n\nOriginally, the invocation of the Muse was an indication that the speaker was working inside the poetic tradition, according to the established formulas. For example:\nHomer, in Book I of The Odyssey:\n:\"Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns\n:driven time and again off course, once he had plundered\n:the hallowed heights of Troy.\" (Robert Fagles translation, 1996)\nVirgil, in Book I of the Aeneid:\n:O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;\n:What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;\n:For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began\n:To persecute so brave, so just a man; [...]\n:(John Dryden translation, 1697)\nBesides Homer and Virgil, other famous works that included an invocation of the muse are the first of the carmina by Catullus, Ovid's Metamorphoses and Amores, Dante's Inferno (Canto II), Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde (Book II), Shakespeare's Henry V (Act 1, Prologue), his 38th sonnet, and Milton's Paradise Lost (opening of Book 1).\n\nFrom cults to modern museums\n\nWhen Pythagoras arrived at Croton, his first advice to the Crotoniates was to build a shrine to the Muses at the center of the city, to promote civic harmony and learning. Local cults of the Muses often became associated with springs or with fountains. The Muses themselves were sometimes called Aganippids because of their association with a fountain called Aganippe. Other fountains, Hippocrene and Pirene, were also important locations associated with the Muses. Some sources occasionally referred to the Muses as \"Corycides\" (or \"Corycian nymphs\") after a cave on Mount Parnassos, called the Corycian Cave. The Muses were venerated especially in Boeotia, in the Valley of the Muses near Helicon, and in Delphi and the Parnassus, where Apollo became known as Mousagetes (\"Muse-leader\") after the sites were rededicated to his cult.\n\nOften Muse-worship was associated with the hero-cults of poets: the tombs of Archilochus on Thasos and of Hesiod and Thamyris in Boeotia all played host to festivals in which poetic recitations accompanied sacrifices to the Muses. The Library of Alexandria and its circle of scholars formed around a mousaion (i. e. \"museum\" or shrine of the Muses) close to the tomb of Alexander the Great. Many Enlightenment figures sought to re-establish a \"Cult of the Muses\" in the 18th century. A famous Masonic lodge in pre-Revolutionary Paris was called Les Neuf Soeurs (\"The Nine Sisters\", that is, the Nine Muses); Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Danton, and other influential Enlightenment figures attended it. As a side-effect of this movement the word \"museum\" (originally, \"cult place of the Muses\") came to refer to a place for the public display of knowledge.\n\nModern use \n\nNot only are the Muses explicitly used in modern English to refer to an artistic inspiration, as when one cites one's own artistic muse, but they also are implicit in words and phrases such as \"amuse\", \"museum\" (Latinised from mouseion—a place where the muses were worshipped), \"music\", and \"musing upon\".  In current literature, the influential role that the muse plays has been extended to the political sphere. \n\nGallery \n\nFile:Musa6-terpsichore-vs.jpg|Terpsichore\nFile:Erato.jpg|Erato\nFile:Clio, von Hugo Kaufmann.jpg|Clio\nFile:Musa4-thalia-vs.jpg|Thalia\nFile:Muse of cortona.png|Polyhymnia\nFile:Calliope.jpg|Calliope\nFile:Plat reliure Apollon thyase.JPG|Apollo and the Muses\nFile:7002.Euterpe(Muse der Lyrik und des Flötenspiels)Musenrondell-Sanssouci Steffen Heilfort.JPG|Euterpe\nFile:Simon Vouet - Parnassus or Apollo and the Muses (detail) - WGA25374.jpg|Parnassus\nFile:Uranie et Melpomène - 1680-1681 Louis de Boullogne.jpg|Urania and Melpomene"

                "Albert Finney  (born 9 May 1936) is an English actor. Beginning in the theatre, Finney was especially successful in plays by William Shakespeare before he switched to films. He achieved prominence in films in the early 1960s, his debut being The Entertainer, directed by Tony Richardson, who had directed him in theatre plays various times before. He became a leading Free Cinema figure, and has maintained a successful career in theatre, film and television. He is known for his roles in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960), Tom Jones (1963), Scrooge (1970), Annie (1982), The Dresser (1983), Miller's Crossing (1990), Big Fish (2003), The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007), The Bourne Legacy (2012), and the James Bond film Skyfall (2012).\n\nA recipient of BAFTA, Golden Globe, Emmy and Screen Actors Guild Awards, Finney has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor four times, for Tom Jones (1963), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Dresser (1983), and Under the Volcano (1984); and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Erin Brockovich (2000).\n\nEarly life\n\nFinney was born in the Charlestown area of Pendleton, Salford, Lancashire, England, the son of Alice (née Hobson) and Albert Finney, Sr., a bookmaker.  He was educated at Tootal Drive Primary School, Salford Grammar School and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.\n\nCareer\n\nFinney graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. His career began in the theatre; he made his first appearance on the London stage in 1958 in Jane Arden's The Party, directed by Charles Laughton, who starred in the production along with his wife, Elsa Lanchester. Then in 1959 he appeared at Stratford in Coriolanus, replacing a sick Laurence Olivier (as Coriolanus). \n\nHis first film appearance was a role in Tony Richardson's The Entertainer (1960), with Laurence Olivier, but he made his breakthrough with his portrayal of a disillusioned factory worker in Karel Reisz's film version of Alan Sillitoe's Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. This led to a series of \"Angry Young Man\" roles in kitchen sink dramas, before he starred in the Academy Award-winning 1963 film Tom Jones. Prior to this, Finney had been chosen to play T. E. Lawrence in David Lean's production of Lawrence of Arabia after a successful, and elaborate, screen-test that took 4 days to shoot. However, Finney baulked at signing a multi-year contract for Producer Sam Spiegel and chose not to accept the role.  The tremendous success of Tom Jones saw British exhibitors vote Finney the ninth most popular star at the box office in 1963. \n\nAfter Charlie Bubbles (1968), which he also directed, his film appearances became less frequent as he focused more on acting on stage. During this period, one of his high-profile film roles was as Agatha Christie's Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot in the 1974 film Murder On The Orient Express. Finney became so well known for the role that he complained that it typecast him for a number of years. \"People really do think I am 300 pounds with a French accent\" he said.\n\nWhile being known for his dramatic roles, Finney appeared and sang in two musical films: Scrooge and the Hollywood film version of Annie, which was directed by John Huston, who would direct him once again in Under The Volcano two years later. He also sings in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride.\n\nFinney made several television productions for the BBC in the 1990s, including The Green Man (1990), based on a novel by Kingsley Amis, the acclaimed drama A Rather English Marriage (1998) (with Tom Courtenay), and the lead role in Dennis Potter's final two plays, Karaoke and Cold Lazarus in 1996 and 1997. In the latter he played a frozen, disembodied head.\n\nFinney also made an appearance at Roger Waters' The Wall Concert in Berlin, where he played \"The Judge\" during the performance of \"The Trial\".\n\nEven with his success on the big screen, Finney never abandoned his stage performances. He continued his association with the National Theatre Company at the Old Vic in London, where he performed in the mid-1960s in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing and Chekov's The Cherry Orchard. He received Tony Award nominations for Luther (1964) and A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (1968), and also starred onstage in Love for Love, Strindberg's Miss Julie, Black Comedy, The Country Wife, Alpha Beta, Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape, Tamburlaine the Great, Another Time and, his last stage appearance in 1997, 'Art', which preceded the 1998 Tony Award-winning Broadway run. He won an Olivier Award for Orphans in 1986 and has won three Evening Standard Theatre Awards for Best Actor. \n\nIn 2002 his critically acclaimed portrayal of Winston Churchill in The Gathering Storm won him BAFTA and Emmy awards as Best Actor.\n\nHe also played the title role in the television series My Uncle Silas, based on the short stories by H. E. Bates, about a roguish but lovable poacher-cum-farm labourer looking after his great-nephew. The show ran for two series from 2000 until 2003.\n\nA lifelong supporter of Manchester United, Finney narrated the documentary Munich, about the aircrash that killed most of the Busby Babes in 1958, which was shown on United's TV channel MUTV in February 2008. \n\nPersonal life\n\nBy his first wife, Jane Wenham, he has a son, Simon, who works in the film industry as a camera operator.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1978, he was married to French actress Anouk Aimée.\n\nIn May 2011, Finney disclosed that he had been receiving treatment for kidney cancer.  \n\nAwards and honours\n\nFinney turned down the offer of a CBE in 1980 and a Knighthood in 2000. He has criticised the honours system for \"perpetuating snobbery\". \n\nHe has five Oscar nominations but has never won. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor four times, for Tom Jones (1963), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Dresser (1983), and Under the Volcano (1984); and was nominated for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Erin Brockovich (2000).\n\nJulia Roberts mentioned Albert Finney in her Oscar acceptance speech for Best Actress in Erin Brockovich, thanking him and sharing the Oscar with him. \n \nFinney has 13 BAFTA nominations (9 film, 4 TV), winning two:\n*1960 Best British Actor for Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\n*1960 Most Promising Newcomer for Saturday Night and Sunday Morning  Won\n*1963 Best British Actor for Tom Jones\n*1973 Best Actor for Gumshoe\n*1974 Best Actor for Murder on the Orient Express\n*1982 Best Actor for Shoot the Moon\n*1984 Best Actor for The Dresser\n*1990 Best Actor (BAFTA TV Awards) for The Green Man\n*1996 Best Actor (BAFTA TV Awards) for Karaoke/Cold Lazarus\n*1998 Best Actor (BAFTA TV Awards) for A Rather English Marriage\n*2000 Best Supporting Actor for Erin Brockovich\n*2002 Best Actor (BAFTA TV Awards) for The Gathering Storm  Won\n*2003 Best Supporting Actor for Big Fish\n\nIn addition Finney received the BAFTA Fellowship in 2001.\n\nHe won an Emmy Award, for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Made for TV Movie, for his performance as Winston Churchill in HBO's The Gathering Storm. He had previously been nominated for the HBO telefilm The Image (1990).\n\nHe has received nine Golden Globe nominations, winning three:\n*1963 Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for Tom Jones\n*1963 Most Promising Newcomer (Male) for Tom Jones   –   Won\n*1970 Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for Scrooge, Won\n*1982 Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama for Shoot the Moon\n*1983 Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama for The Dresser\n*1984 Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama for Under the Volcano\n*2000 Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for Erin Brockovich\n*2002 Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television for The Gathering Storm Won\n*2003 Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for Big Fish\n\nFor his work on Broadway, Finney has been nominated for two Tony Awards, both for Best Actor in a Play, for Luther in 1964, and A Day in the Death of Joe Egg in 1968.

                "Peter  Seamus O'Toole  (; 2 August 1932 – 14 December 2013) was a British-Irish stage and film actor. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and began working in the theatre, gaining recognition as a Shakespearean actor at the Bristol Old Vic and with the English Stage Company before making his film debut in 1959.\n\nHe achieved international recognition playing T. E. Lawrence in Lawrence of Arabia (1962) for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. He received seven further Oscar nominations – for Becket (1964), The Lion in Winter (1968), Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969), The Ruling Class (1972), The Stunt Man (1980), My Favorite Year (1982), and Venus (2006) – and holds the record for the most Academy Award acting nominations without a win. He won four Golden Globe Awards, one British Academy Film Award, and one Primetime Emmy Award. In 2002, O'Toole was awarded the Honorary Academy Award.\n\nEarly life\n\nO'Toole was born in 1932. Some sources give his birthplace as Connemara, County Galway, Ireland,  while others cite St James University Hospital, Leeds, England.   O'Toole claimed he was not certain of his birthplace or date, noting in his autobiography that, while he accepted 2 August as his birthdate, he had a birth certificate from each country, with the Irish one giving a June 1932 birth date. Peter had an elder sister, Patricia. He grew up in the Hunslet, south Leeds,  son of Constance Jane Eliot (née Ferguson), a Scottish  nurse, and Patrick Joseph \"Spats\" O'Toole, an Irish metal plater, football player and racecourse bookmaker.     When O'Toole was one year old, his family began a five-year tour of major racecourse towns in Northern England. He was brought up as a Catholic.  \n\nO'Toole was evacuated from Leeds early in the Second World War and went to a Catholic school for seven or eight years, St Joseph's Secondary School at Joseph Street, Hunslet, where he was \"implored\" to become right-handed. \"I used to be scared stiff of the nuns: their whole denial of womanhood – the black dresses and the shaving of the hair – was so horrible, so terrifying ... Of course, that's all been stopped. They're sipping gin and tonic in the Dublin pubs now, and a couple of them flashed their pretty ankles at me just the other day\", he said. \n\nUpon leaving school O'Toole obtained employment as a trainee journalist and photographer on the Yorkshire Evening Post, until he was called up for national service as a signaller in the Royal Navy. As reported in a radio interview in 2006 on NPR, he was asked by an officer whether he had something he had always wanted to do. His reply was that he had always wanted to try being either a poet or an actor. O'Toole attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) from 1952 to 1954 on a scholarship after being rejected by the Abbey Theatre's drama school in Dublin by the director Ernest Blythe, because he couldn't speak the Irish language. At RADA, he was in the same class as Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Brian Bedford. O'Toole described this as \"the most remarkable class the academy ever had, though we weren't reckoned for much at the time. We were all considered dotty.\" \n\nCareer\n\nO'Toole began working in the theatre, gaining recognition as a Shakespearean actor at the Bristol Old Vic and with the English Stage Company, before making his television debut in 1954. He first appeared on film in 1959 in a minor role in The Day They Robbed the Bank of England.  O'Toole's major break came when he was chosen to play T. E. Lawrence in Sir David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia (1962), after Marlon Brando proved unavailable and Albert Finney turned down the role. His performance was ranked number one in Premiere magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Performances of All Time.  The role introduced him to US audiences and earned him the first of his eight nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor. T. E. Lawrence, portrayed by O'Toole, was selected in 2003 as the tenth-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. \n\nO'Toole was one of several actors to be Oscar-nominated for playing the same role in two different films: he played King Henry II in both Becket (1964) and The Lion in Winter (1968). O'Toole played Hamlet under Laurence Olivier's direction in the premiere production of the Royal National Theatre in 1963. He demonstrated his comedic abilities alongside Peter Sellers in the Woody Allen-scripted comedy What's New Pussycat? (1965). He appeared in Seán O'Casey's Juno and the Paycock at Dublin's Gaiety Theatre. \n\nIn 1969, he played the title role in the film Goodbye, Mr. Chips, a musical adaptation of James Hilton's novella, starring opposite Petula Clark. He was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actor and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nO'Toole fulfilled a lifetime ambition in 1970 when he performed on stage in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, alongside Donal McCann, at Dublin's Abbey Theatre. In 1972, he played both Miguel de Cervantes and his fictional creation Don Quixote in Man of La Mancha, the motion picture adaptation of the 1965 hit Broadway musical, opposite Sophia Loren. The film was a critical and commercial failure, criticised for using mostly non-singing actors. His singing was dubbed by tenor Simon Gilbert,  but the other actors did their own singing. O'Toole and co-star James Coco, who played both Cervantes's manservant and Sancho Panza, both received Golden Globe nominations for their performances. In 1980, O'Toole starred as Tiberius in the Penthouse-funded biopic, Caligula.\n\nIn 1980, he received critical acclaim for playing the director in the behind-the-scenes film The Stunt Man.   He received mixed reviews as John Tanner in Man and Superman and Henry Higgins in Pygmalion, and won a Laurence Olivier Award for his performance in Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell (1989).  O'Toole was nominated for another Oscar for My Favorite Year (1982), a light romantic comedy about the behind-the-scenes at a 1950s TV variety-comedy show, in which O'Toole plays an aging swashbuckling film star reminiscent of Errol Flynn. He also appeared in 1987's The Last Emperor.\n\nHe won a Primetime Emmy Award for his role as Bishop Pierre Cauchon in the 1999 mini-series Joan of Arc. In 2004, he played King Priam in the summer blockbuster Troy. In 2005, he appeared on television as the older version of legendary 18th century Italian adventurer Giacomo Casanova in the BBC drama serial Casanova. The younger Casanova, seen for most of the action, was played by David Tennant, who had to wear contact lenses to match his brown eyes to O'Toole's blue. O'Toole was once again nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Maurice in the 2006 film Venus, directed by Roger Michell, his eighth such nomination. \n\nO'Toole co-starred in the Pixar animated film Ratatouille (2007), an animated film about a rat with dreams of becoming the greatest chef in Paris, as Anton Ego, a food critic. He also appeared in the second season of Showtime's successful drama series The Tudors (2008), portraying Pope Paul III, who excommunicates King Henry VIII from the church; an act which leads to a showdown between the two men in seven of the ten episodes. Also in 2008, he starred alongside Jeremy Northam and Sam Neill in the New Zealand/British film Dean Spanley, based on an Alan Sharp adaptation of Irish author Lord Dunsany's short novel, My Talks with Dean Spanley. \n\nOn 10 July 2012, O'Toole released a statement announcing his retirement from acting. \n\nPersonal life\n\nWhile studying at RADA in the early 1950s, O'Toole was active in protesting against British involvement in the Korean War. Later, in the 1960s, he was an active opponent of the Vietnam War. He played a role in the creation of the current form of the well-known folksong \"Carrickfergus\" which he related to Dominic Behan, who put it in print and made a recording in the mid-1960s. \n\nIn 1959, he married Welsh actress Siân Phillips, with whom he had two daughters: actress Kate and Patricia. They were divorced in 1979. Phillips later said in two autobiographies that O'Toole had subjected her to mental cruelty, largely fuelled by drinking, and was subject to bouts of extreme jealousy when she finally left him for a younger lover. \n\nO'Toole and his girlfriend, model Karen Brown,  had a son, Lorcan Patrick O'Toole (born 17 March 1983), when O'Toole was fifty years old. Lorcan, now an actor, was a pupil at Harrow School, boarding at West Acre from 1996. \n\nSevere illness almost ended O'Toole's life in the late 1970s. His stomach cancer was misdiagnosed as resulting from his alcoholic excess.  O'Toole underwent surgery in 1976 to have his pancreas and a large portion of his stomach removed, which resulted in insulin-dependent diabetes. In 1978, he nearly died from a blood disorder. He eventually recovered, however, and returned to work. He resided on the Sky Road, just outside Clifden, Connemara, County Galway from 1963, and at the height of his career maintained homes in Dublin, London and Paris (at the Ritz, which was where his character supposedly lived in the film How to Steal a Million).\nIn an interview with National Public Radio in December 2006, O'Toole revealed that he knew all 154 of Shakespeare's sonnets. A self-described romantic, O'Toole regarded the sonnets as among the finest collection of English poems, reading them daily. In Venus, he recites Sonnet 18 (\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\"). O'Toole wrote two memoirs. Loitering With Intent: The Child chronicles his childhood in the years leading up to World War II and was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year in 1992. His second, Loitering With Intent: The Apprentice, is about his years spent training with a cadre of friends at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.\n\nO'Toole played rugby league as a child in Leeds  and was also a rugby union fan, attending Five Nations matches with friends and fellow rugby fans Richard Harris, Kenneth Griffith, Peter Finch and Richard Burton. He was also a lifelong player, coach and enthusiast of cricket  and a fan of Sunderland A.F.C. \n\nO'Toole was interviewed at least three times by Charlie Rose on his eponymous talk show. In a 17 January 2007 interview, O'Toole stated that British actor Eric Porter had most influenced him, adding that the difference between actors of yesterday and today is that actors of his generation were trained for \"theatre, theatre, theatre\". He also believes that the challenge for the actor is \"to use his imagination to link to his emotion\" and that \"good parts make good actors\". However, in other venues (including the DVD commentary for Becket), O'Toole credited Donald Wolfit as being his most important mentor. In an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (11 January 2007), O'Toole stated that the actor with whom he most enjoyed working was Katharine Hepburn.\n\nAlthough he lost faith in organised religion as a teenager, O'Toole expressed positive sentiments regarding the life of Jesus Christ. In an interview for The New York Times,  he said \"No one can take Jesus away from me... there's no doubt there was a historical figure of tremendous importance, with enormous notions. Such as peace.\" He called himself \"a retired Christian\" who prefers \"an education and reading and facts\" to faith. In the last decade of his life, he played \"Samuel\" in One Night with the King (2006).\n\nDeath\n\nO'Toole died on 14 December 2013 at Wellington Hospital, London, aged 81.  His funeral was held at Golders Green Crematorium in London on 21 December 2013, where he was cremated in a wicker coffin. \n\nO'Toole's remains are planned to be taken to Connemara, Ireland. His daughter Kate said: \"We're bringing him home. It's what he would have wanted.\" They are currently being kept at the residence of the President of Ireland, Áras an Uachtaráin, by the current President Michael D. Higgins who is an old friend of the actor. His family plan to return to Ireland to fulfill his wishes and take them to the west of Ireland when they can. \n\nOn 18 May 2014 a new prize was launched in memory of Peter O'Toole at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School; this includes an annual award given to two young actors from the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, including a professional contract at Bristol Old Vic Theatre.\n\nAcademy Award nominations\n\nO'Toole was nominated eight times for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.\n\nIn 2002, the Academy honoured him with an Academy Honorary Award for his entire body of work and his lifelong contribution to film. O'Toole initially balked about accepting, and wrote the Academy a letter saying that he was \"still in the game\" and would like more time to \"win the lovely bugger outright.\" The Academy informed him that they would bestow the award whether he wanted it or not.

                "Black Sea Geography\nMap courtesy of the            Black Sea Web Project.\nThe Black Sea lies between southeastern Europe and Asia Minor. Excluding            its northern arm, the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea occupies about 168,500            square miles (436,400 square kilometers). It is connected to the Aegean            Sea through the Bosporus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, and            has been of critical importance to regional commerce throughout the            ages.\nThis major inland sea is bordered by six countries — Romania            and Bulgaria to the west; Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia to the north            and east; and Turkey to the south. Additionally, it is impacted by another            10 nations through the five major rivers that empty into the Black Sea,            the largest of which is the Danube River.\nThe Bordering Countries\nThe following is a brief geographic overview of the nations that border          the Black Sea. Also see the History and          Culture section to learn more about them.\nBulgaria. This mostly mountainous            nation, slightly larger than Tennessee, occupies 42,823 square miles            (110,912 sq km) and is home to an estimated 7.6 million people. The            capital city is Sofia. About 85% of the people are ethnic Bulgarians,            and nearly 10% are Turkish.\nThe Golden                Sands Resort along Bulgaria's Black Sea coast.\nThe Balkan Mountains cross the northwestern corner of            Bulgaria to the Black Sea, sloping gradually to a plateau that ends            at the Danube, the country's chief river. The southern side of the mountain            range is bounded by narrow plains, such as the Thracian Plain, an important            agricultural region. Forests cover about a third of Bulgaria, and the            country has a wealth of minerals, mainly iron ore and coal. Bulgaria            has mild summers and cold, snowy winters.\nIn addition to agriculture (primary products: vegetables,            fruits, tobacco, livestock, wine, wheat, barley, sunflowers, sugar beets),            Bulgaria has major industries for the production of electricity, gas            and water, food and beverages, machinery and equipment, base metals,            chemical products, refined petroleum, and nuclear fuel. A major emphasis            on the development of heavy industry occurred in the country after World            War II. Chief exports include clothing, footwear, iron and steel, machinery            and equipment, and fuels. Varna ,            the country's largest city, is Bulgaria's principal port on the Black            Sea.\nRomania. With a total land area of about 91,700 square miles (237,500 sq km), Romania          is slightly larger than the state of Oregon. More than 89% of the country's          22.3 million people are ethnic Romanians. Hungarians are the largest minority          (about 8%), living chiefly in Transylvania. Romania's capital and largest          city is Bucharest.\nA forest-lined lake fringes              the Black Sea coast at Neptun,              Romania.\nRomania is shaped roughly like an oval. The central Transylvanian Basin          is separated from the lowlands of Moldavia on the east by the Carpathian          Mountains and from the Walachian Plain on the south by the Transylvanian          Alps. Wild boar, wolves, bears, and deer may be found in the mountainous          regions. The lowlands serve as important agricultural areas. The country's          most important river, the Danube, flows through a delta in the Dobruja          region into the Black Sea.\nMore than 43% of Romania is cultivated. The chief agricultural products          include wheat, corn, sugar beets, sunflower seeds, potatoes, grapes, eggs,          and sheep. The country's major industries include textiles and footwear,          light machinery and auto assembly, mining, timber, construction materials,          metallurgy, chemicals, food processing, and petroleum refining. Constanta is one of Romania's principal Black Sea ports.\nMonument to the scuttled              ships of the Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol.\nUkraine. The second largest country in Europe,          Ukraine is mostly a broad, flat plain. At 233,090 square miles (603,700          sq km), Ukraine is slightly smaller than Texas and has an estimated population          of 48.3 million. Over 73% are ethnic Ukrainians, while Russians represent          the largest minority, at 22%. The capital and largest city is Kyiv (Kiev).\nMountains are found only in the west (the Carpathians), and in the              Crimean Peninsula in the extreme south. Deer, beaver, marten, vultures,              and the steppe eagle are among the wildlife found in Ukraine.\nIn the fertile soil of the central and southern regions, agriculture              is a top industry, producing wheat, sugar beets, potatoes, beef, milk,              vegetables, and sunflower seeds. Other industry is based on the country's              rich mineral resources, including coal, iron ore, manganese, bauxite,              and salt.\nOdessa and Sevastopol are Ukraine's largest ports on the Black Sea.\n \nRussia. At nearly 6.6 million square miles (17 million sq km), Russia is the            largest country in the world in geographic size, occupying more than            one-ninth of the world's total land area. It is just slightly less than            1.8 times the size of the United States. Russia has a population of            nearly 145 million. The majority live in European Russia, but sizable            communities also live near mining and industrial centers. Russians are            the predominant nationality at over 80%, with Tatars, Ukrainians, and            Chuvash the largest minorities.\nRussia's three major geographic regions include European            Russia, consisting of the territory west of the Ural Mountains; Siberia,            stretching east of the Urals nearly to the Pacific Ocean; and far eastern            Russia, including the extreme southeast and Pacific coast. Russia's            capital and largest city is Moscow.\nEuropean Russian is primarily a rocky, rolling plain with            broad marshes. Its southern border includes the Caucasus Mountains,            which extend between the Black and Caspian seas. While the winters may            be cool along the Black Sea coast, this part of Russia has a much more            temperate climate than Siberia, where temperatures average -59°F            in January and have reached as cold as 90 degrees below zero.\nNovorossijsk is Russia's                only deep-water port on the Black Sea. It is a major oil port.\nForests cover over two-fifths of Russia, amounting to            nearly one-fourth of the world's forest area. The taiga, or boreal forest,            in the north contains the world's largest coniferous forest, representing            about half the Earth's softwood timber. Lowland areas have a natural            vegetation of grasslands with scattered groves of trees.\nRussia's chief agricultural products include grain, sugar            beets, sunflower seeds, vegetables, fruits, beef, and milk. The country            has a complete range of mining and extractive industries producing coal,            oil, gas, chemicals, and metals; all forms of machine building from            rolling mills to high-performance aircraft and space vehicles; shipbuilding;            road and rail transportation equipment; communications equipment; agricultural            machinery, tractors, and construction equipment; electric power generating            and transmitting equipment; medical and scientific instruments; consumer durables, textiles, food stuffs, and handicrafts.\nNovorossijsk is Russia's primary Black Sea port.\nThe port of Batumi                on Georgia's Black Sea Coast.\nGeorgia. The Caucasus Mountains dominate this country, which is            slightly smaller than South Carolina, with a total area of 26,900 square            miles (69,700 sq km). The main ridge of the Caucasus Mountains forms            most of the northern boundary of Georgia, while the Lesser Caucasus            Mountains occupy the southern regions.\nThe Kolkhida Lowland opens to the Black Sea in the west.            The uplands are dry, while the coastal climate along the Black Sea is            very Mediterranean-like — warm and pleasant. The coastal climate            and soils are conducive to growing tea, citrus fruit, hazelnuts, and            grapes, which are important agricultural products.\nOther industries include the mining of manganese and copper,            the production of steel, aircraft, appliances, machine tools, chemicals,            alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, wood products, and wine.\nNearly 5 million people live in Georgia. Georgians form            about 70% of the population, followed by numbers of Armenians, Russians,            and Azeris. The capital and largest city is T'blisi. Batumi, Poti, and            Sokhumi are the country's primary Black Sea ports.\nTurkey. The main area of Turkey, known as Anatolia, is in Asia while Turkish              Thrace, representing about 3% of the nation's total area, is in Europe.              At nearly 301,000 square miles (780,000 sq km), Turkey is a little              larger than Texas. Its capital is Ankara, and Istanbul is the largest              city.\nIstanbul, Turkey,                  links Europe and Asia. Copyright R. A. Taylor, Images                  of the World.\nTurkey is mostly mountainous, with a narrow coastal              plain and high central plateau (Anatolia). The country is located              in several active seismic zones and is subject to frequent earthquakes.Thrace              and the lands bordering the Sea of Marmara is a region of gently rolling              hills rising in the east to Mount Ulu (Olympus) at 8,343 feet (2,543              meters). The Aegean and Mediterranean coastlands are narrow and hilly              with little arable land, except for a plain in the east where cotton              is grown. The steep slopes of the Black Sea coastline rise directly              to the Pontic Mountains. The most mountainous area is the eastern              highlands. This is where Mount Ararat is located, noted in the Bible              as the place where Noah's ark came to rest.\nOver 67 million people live in Turkey. About 69% live in urban areas compared to only 21 % in 1950. Turks form about 80%              of the population, while Kurds constitute most of the remaining 20%.\nTurkey is one of the few countries of the world that              is self-sufficient in providing basic foods. Nearly half the work              force is engaged in farming. The chief crops include wheat, sugar              beets, barley, tobacco, olives, cotton, citrus, tomatoes, melons,              grapes, maize, livestock, and apples. Fishing also is important, with              most of the catch coming from the Mediterranean and Black seas.\nIn addition to rich agricultural resources, Turkey has              significant deposits of lignite, coal, iron ore, and chromium. Its              most important industry and largest export is textiles and clothing.              Other major industries include food processing, automobiles, mining,              steel, petroleum, construction, lumber, and paper.\nTurkey's principal port on the Black Sea is Istanbul .",
                "Europe’s Continental Boundaries | Counter-Currents Publishing\nEurope’s Continental Boundaries\nEurope by night\n4,475 words\nOf the Earth’s seven continents, Europe is the second smallest in total area—only Australia is smaller. In terms of population density it is the second largest after Asia. Geographically, Europe is a peninsula of Eurasia. It has been described as a peninsula of peninsulas and islands. \nThe surprising difficulty of defining Europe as a continent can be seen not only in differing definitions of its boundaries, or the bewildering number of candidates for its most extreme points north, south, east, and west, but even in disagreements over which locale constitutes the geographical center of Europe. The answers to all of these questions seem completely undeterminable in any precise kind of way. Fortunately, the broad outlines are clear.\nThe “boundaries of Europe” discussed here concern only Europe as a continent ending (or beginning) at the Ural Mountains. This creates a formalistic and artificially truncated political and racial horizon.\nEurope: One of the most commonly used continental boundaries\nNotably, it ignores the Russian Federation as a unitary racial/political/social entity—a nation, including Russia-in-Asia, extending across much of northern Eurasia and constituting the world’s largest country in total area. Its 6.6 million square miles include one-eighth of the Earth’s inhabited land area—1.7 x the land area of Canada or 2 x the size of the Roman Empire at its greatest extent.\nMoreover, some countries still possess overseas territories outside Europe that are integral parts of the homeland. With the exception of Greenland and a few small islands close to Europe, such territories will not be discussed here.\nDue to Europe’s peninsular structure, the most difficult boundary to define is the eastern one, dividing continental Europe from continental Asia. Whether various countries or portions of countries are grouped geographically with Europe or Asia varies according to the sources consulted.\nBecause the major maritime boundaries that separate the continent of Europe from the Earth’s other continents—the Mediterranean Sea on the south, the Atlantic Ocean on the west, and the Arctic Ocean on the north—have well-defined coastlines, the close analysis of such boundaries primarily involves the allocation of various islands to Europe or some other continent.\nThe Boundary of Europe and Asia\nThe Southeastern boundary between Europe and Asia\nEvidently the first man to define the eastern continental boundary between Europe and Asia pretty much as it exists today is Philip Johan von Strahlenberg (1676–1747), a Swedish army officer, explorer, and scholar of German descent. As defined in his book Das nord- und ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia (The north and east part of Europe and Asia) (Stockholm, 1730), which was translated into English, French, and Spanish, Strahlenberg’s border followed the chain of the Ural Mountains north-to-south, then the Emba River to the north coast of the Caspian Sea before passing through the Kuma-Manych Depression to the Black Sea. This Depression, named after two rivers, lies just north of the Caucasus Mountains which are today regarded as the true boundary.\nThe continent’s eastern boundary cuts Russia in two—European Russia and Asian Russia. There is a strikingly uneven distribution of human and natural resources between the Asian and European regions. Asian Russia, about the size of China and India combined, occupies roughly three-quarters of Russian Federation territory. But the quarter of the country west of the Urals—a major portion of continental Europe—is home to more than 75% of Russia’s population and most of its industry and agriculture. It was in European Russia that the Russian nation took shape. Despite governmental efforts to resettle Russians in sparsely populated Asian areas with abundant natural resources, the imbalance persists.\nThe Urals boundary\nThe watershed divide of the Ural Mountains forms the natural land boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia. The range, averaging 3,000–4,000 ft. in height, extends about 1,640 miles north-south from the Arctic Ocean to the northern steppe of Kazakhstan. At 6,214 ft., Mount Narodnaya in the northern Urals is its highest peak. The densely forested central portion of the range, the Middle Urals, is broader and lower in altitude, a plateau region of 1,000–2,000 ft.\nSeveral low east-west passes provide major transportation routes through the Urals to the East (Asia).\nA glance at a map shows that from the Urals the continental boundary broadly follows the unnavigable Ural River that rises at the mountains’ south end and empties into the northern end of the Caspian Sea to the south. However, this segment of the land border is indeterminate, as one scholar has noted:\nFor most of its length, the eastern border of Europe, namely the Ural mountains, is beyond contention. But between the southern end of the Urals (from, say, the city of Orsk where the Ural river turns westwards) and the Caspian Sea there is a gap from north-east to south-west of some 400 km.[249 mi]. Here there is no agreement as to where Europe ends and Asia begins and at least three “natural” lines have been suggested, namely:\n(i) the Volga river, which however seems too far west and, moreover, divides a number of constituent republics of the Russian Federation between the two continents;\n(ii) the Emba river, which, of all major waterways, continues the most directly the line of the Urals in a broadly south-westerly direction towards the Caspian; this, however, would divide the Republic of Kazakhstan, usually considered as an Asian state, between Asia and Europe and there seems no good reason to accept the Emba as constituting the border;\n(iii) between the Volga and the Emba is the Ural river which, if we were to decide on a “natural” border, would be the most satisfactory of those proposed; this, however, would still leave a substantial part of Kazakhstan in Europe. (Glanville Price, Encyclopedia of the Languages of Europe, 2000, p. xii.)\nThe author opts for the existing Russian-Kazakhstan border. The downside with such a choice is that political borders change constantly.\nPolitical boundaries of Southeastern Europe, the Black and Caspain Seas\nThe next major segment of the boundary is formed by the Caspian Sea, bordered in Europe by Russia and in Asia by Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, and Azerbaijan. 746 mi. long and 270 mi. wide, it is the largest completely enclosed body of water, or inland sea, on Earth. It is fed by the Volga, Ural, and Emba rivers from the north. This sea was known to the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Persians.\nThe border of Russia with Georgia and Azerbaijan runs along Caucasus Mountains watershed. The European portion of the 700-mi. east-west mountain range between the Caspian and Black Seas is Ciscaucasia on the north. The Asiatic part, Transcaucasia, lies to the south.\nThe range’s highest peak, Mt. Elbrus (18,481 ft.) is often counted as Europe’s highest. The Caucasus are crossed by several high passess, the two best known of which are Mamison Pass in the center, and Daryal (or Darial) Pass, which was fortified as early as 150 BC and has vertical rock walls 5,900 ft. high.\nThe Black Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and Caspian Sea\nThe Black Sea (ancient Euxine Sea) between Europe and Asia has been joined since ancient times with the Aegean Sea (part of the Mediterranean), and through it the Atlantic Ocean, by the Bosporus/Sea of Marmara/Dardanelles waterway. The Black Sea is connected to its own northern arm, the 200-mi. long Sea of Azov, by the Kerch Strait.\nRussia’s mighty Don River empties into the Sea of Azov at Azov, near the ancient site of Tanais, a Greek colony. Azov was captured by Vladimir I in the 900s AD and by the Genoese, who made it a trading port, in the 1200s. Sacked by the Mongol conqueror Tamerlane in 1395, it was held alternately by Russians and Turks until it was finally secured by Russia in 1739.\nIt was Vladimir I who established the Orthodox Eastern Church as the state religion c. 989 AD, thereby linking Russia religiously and culturally to the Eastern Roman Empire throughout the medieval period.\nMajor European rivers flowing into the Black Sea are the Danube, Dniester, Bug, Dnieper, and Kuban.\nThe steppe region north of the Black Sea has been proposed by some scholars as the original homeland (Urheimat) of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. Others contend that the heartland was further east toward the Caspian Sea, and still others that it was in Anatolia (present-day Turkey).\nLegendarily, the Black Sea was sailed by Jason and the Argonauts. In a sacred grove in ancient Colchis (contemporary Georgia) on its eastern shore, the Greek heroes sought the Golden Fleece.\nIn ancient times the Black Sea was crossed by Hittites, Carians, Thracians, Greeks, Persians, Cimmerians, Scythians, and Romans, and later by the East Romans (Byzantines), Goths, Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Slavs, Varangians (East Vikings), European Crusaders, Venetians, and Genoese.\nThe large peninsula extending into the Black Sea on its northern shore, framed on the east by the Sea of Azov, is the Crimea, site of the Crimean War (1854–1856). In the 8th century BC it was inhabited by the Cimmerians, who were expelled by the Scythians in the 7th century. The southern coast of the Crimea was settled in the 6th century BC by Greek traders who maintained extensive trade ties with Athens. In WWII Germans occupied the peninsula from 1941–1944. At Yalta in 1945, FDR and Churchill handed Eastern Europe to the Communists.\nThe Mediterranean Boundary\nThe Mediterranean Sea: Europe to the North, Africa to the South, Asia to the East\nTo the south Europe is separated from Africa and Asia by the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar. Very unlike Europe north of the Alps, the Mediterranean climate has hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters.\nEuropean nations with a Mediterranean shoreline are Spain, France, Monaco, Italy, the island of Malta, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Greece and Turkey.\nTraditionally, “Turkey” refers to “European Turkey” or “Easterm Thrace”—the 3% of Turkey situated north of the Dardanelles/Sea of Marmara/Bosporus waterway and regarded as geographically part of Europe, distinguished from “Asiatic Turkey” (Anatolia or Asia Minor), the 97% of Turkey geographically situated in Asia.\nThe Dardanelles, Sea of Marmara, and Bosporus waterways\nNavigable since ancient times, the strategic significance of this interlinked waterway between the Black and Mediterranean Seas was a factor that led Roman Emperor Constantine the Great to found Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) there in 330 AD. It became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, which endured for more than a thousand years.\nHistorically significant Greece, 80% mountainous and slightly smaller than the state of Alabama, has between 1,200–6,000 islands (depending upon how “island” is defined), 227 of them inhabited. The largest are Crete, Euboea, Rhodes, and Lesbos. Its many island chains and peninsulas and are extensions of its mountain ranges. Due to its highly indented shoreline and numerous islands, Greece boasts the twelfth longest coastline in the world, 8,498 miles.\nThe main subdivisions of the Mediterranean Sea, all European, are the Adriatic, Aegean, Tyrrhenian, Ionian, and Ligurian Seas. The Mediterranean as a whole stretches 2,300 miles from east to west.\nDue to the narrow Strait of Gibraltar on the west, the Mediterranean has very low tides. European rivers flowing into the sea, all sources of fresh water, are the Ebro, Rhone, and Po. The Nile in Egypt, the world’s longest river, also empties into the Mediterranean.\nOceanographically, evaporation greatly exceeds precipitation and river runoff in the Mediterranean, a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basin. Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and salinity to increase eastward. This pressure gradient pushes relatively cool, low-salinity water from the Atlantic across the basin; it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east, then sinks in the region of the Levant and circulates westward, to spill over the Strait of Gibraltar. Thus, seawater flow is eastward in the Strait’s surface waters, and westward below; once in the Atlantic, this chemically distinct “Mediterranean Intermediate Water” can persist thousands of kilometres away from its source. (“Mediterranean Sea,” Wikipedia, citing Paul R. Pinet, Invitation to Oceanography, 3rd ed., 1996, 202–207.)\nIslands in the Mediterranean are allocated to Europe, Asia, or Africa respectively.\nMost of the major islands in the Mediterranean—Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, Cyprus, Balearic Islands, Dodecanese, Cyclades, Sporades, Ionian Islands, and Malta—are associated with adjacent European countries.\nOf those that are not, the greatest number belong to Asian Turkey. (However, some definitions of Europe include Asian Turkey.)  Five islands are associated with Tunisia in Africa, and one, Arwad, with Syria in Asia.\nCyprus, with a population of 1.1 million, lies south of Turkey off the coast of Syria, north of Israel. Technically in Asia, it is a member of the Council of Europe and the European Union. The UN classification of world regions places Cyprus in Western Asia, the CIA’s World Factbook in the Middle East.The earliest known human activity on the island dates to the 9th millennium BC. Copper, of which Cyprus was the ancient world’s primary source, was named after the island (Greek Kypros). Copper and its alloy bronze are of enormous significance in the study of European prehistory and archaeology.\nIn a dispute with Greece, Turkey partitioned Cyprus in 1974, establishing the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on 40 percent of the island, a de facto state recognized only by Turkey. International entities regard the entire island as a single independent republic, the Republic of Cyprus, which controls the remaining 60 percent of the island.\nIn modern times Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been at loggerheads. The population is divided between Greek (80%) and Turkish (20%) ethnic groups differentiated by language (Greek, Turkish), nationality, and religion (Greek Orthodox, Sunni Islam). Leaving aside substantial recent foreign immigration, it is doubtful that the two sharply-defined ethnic groups differ racially.\nMalta, an independent European state situated south of the Italian island of Sicily, is the main island of the (three) Maltese Islands. Originally a Phoenician and Carthaginian colony, it was captured by Rome in 218 BC. During WWII it became the world’s most bombed spot, undergoing more than 1,200 air raids. It achieved its indpendence from Great Britain in 1964.\nLooking East: The Strait of Gibraltar, Europe on the left, Africa on the right, the Mediterranean in the middle\nThe Strait of Gibraltar separating Spain from Africa in the western Mediterranean is an 8–23 mile wide, 36-mi. long passage linking the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. Ownership of the “state” of Gibraltar, the 2.5 sq. mi. British territory on Spanish soil, is disputed by Spain.\nThe towering, limestone Rock of Gibraltar and Mount Acho (ancient Abila) at Ceuta, a Spanish exclave in Morocco, Africa, form the classical Pillars of Hercules, which were crowned with silver columns by ancient Phoenician mariners to mark the limits of safe navigation for the Mediterranean peoples. The Semitic (not Jewish) Phoenicians, however, sailed well beyond them, quite possibly circumnavigating the southern tip of Africa and turning north on the other side.\nThe Atlantic Boundary\nIn the west, Europe’s boundary is defined by the Atlantic Ocean, with which the Irish, North, Baltic, Mediterranean, and Black Seas are all connected. This coastline is much warmer than it would otherwise be due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream, the ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and joins the North Atlantic Drift to carry warmth to Europe’s shores.\nThe Atlantic coast can be viewed to some extent as an interlinked geographical-anthropological region. Weather and physical conditions are relatively uniform, resulting in common landscapes, plants, and animals. Via waterborne contact, prehistoric Atlantic peoples presented certain common traits as indicated by artifacts and architectural styles. An example is the European Megalithic Culture . Sir Barry Cunliffe , an English archaeologist and prehistorian, has written a book from such a perspective, Facing the Ocean: The Atlantic and Its Peoples 8000 BC–AD 1500\n(2001). Some genetic studies also seem to interrelate specific groups of people from different parts of Atlantic Europe.\nEurope's Atlantic coast\nAs with Europe’s Mediterranean boundary, the allocation of islands between continents is significant along the Atlantic periphery. Nevertheless, the situation is complex, and any treatment is to some extent arbitrary.\nThe Canary Islands, a Spanish possession and Outermost Region of the European Union, lies 62 miles off the coast of Morocco and Western Sahara in northwest Africa.  The Canaries are the Fortunate Isles of antiquity. They were visited by the Phoenicians, the Greeks, and the Carthaginians. As described by Roman scholar Pliny, large numbers of wild dogs (Latin canes), roamed the islands, which he therefore named Canaria. The indigenous population, the Guanche, a Berber people, eventually became extinct. The present population of 2.1 million is 86% Spanish and 14 % Negro/Moor/Berber.\nAbout 250 miles north of the Canaries and 440 miles from the coast of Africa (Morocco) is Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal and Outermost Region of the EU. It was uninhabited at the time of its discovery by the Portuguese in 1420. Prince Henry the Navigator began colonization of the islands and established sugar plantations there which became the prototype for the plantation system developed in the Portuguese colonies in the Americas after 1550. Internationally recognized Madeira wines remain an important export. Madeira’s present population of 268,000 is classified as ethnic Portuguese, but has a marked degree of West African Negro and North African Berber admixture.\nNorth of Madeira is another autonomous region of Portugal and EU Outermost Region, the Azores, lying 800 miles off the coast of Portugal. The vast majority of its 245,000 inhabitants are an admixture of Portuguese, Sephardic Jews, Moors, Flemish, French, Spaniards, and other European populations. As with the Canaries and Madeira, emigration from the islands has been substantial. By the 1990s more Azoreans resided in the US and Canada than in the archipelago.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge\nMost of Europe’s Atlantic islands, including the Canaries, Madeira, and the British Isles, lie well to the east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a 9,300-mile long submerged mountain chain on the ocean floor extending from the Antarctic Circle in the south to the Arctic Circle in the north, situated midway between the Western Hemisphere and Europe-Africa. From the seafloor, mountains rise 3,300 to 9,800 ft. and measure 930 mi. wide from east to west at their base.\nA few peaks in the ridge break the ocean’s surface, forming islands or groups of islands. The Azores and Iceland are both situated atop such peaks. Greenland, geologically associated with North America to the west, is not.\nIn terms of geographically allocating islands to the North American or European continents, the boundary is usually drawn between Greenland and Iceland, with Greenland on the American and Iceland on the European side.\nBut although Greenland (Danish Grønland) is geographically part of North America, it is historically, politically, and culturally tied to Europe. Greenland formally withdrew from the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1985, but as an overseas territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with extensive home rule, its citizens possess EU citizenship.\nThe largest island in the world, it lies mostly north of the Arctic Circle and is separated from Canada on the west by Davis Strait and Baffin Bay and Iceland on the east by the Denmark Strait. There are numerous islands along its coast, which is deeply indented by fjords. Eighty-five percent of its total area is ice cap. Most of the country’s population lives in villages along the mountainous coastal fringe.\nThe island was discovered and settled around. 982 AD by outlaw Norwegian chieftain Eric the Red, whose Icelandic-born son, Leif Ericsson, later discovered America by sailing west from Greenland. Greenland was uninhabited at the time of the Norse arrival—the Inuit did not arrive until more than 200 years later, c. 1200 AD.\nIn the 1200s the island fell under Norwegian and, subsequently Danish, rule. The Norse colonists mysteriously vanished around 1435, probably due to a climate change known as the Little Ice Age. Archaeological remains and written records indicate malnourishment among the last white inhabitants.\nHvalsey Church, the best-preserved Norse ruins in Greenland. The last written records of the Norse Greenlanders are of a marriage ceremony conducted in this church in 1408\nJewish pop anthropologist Jared Diamond offered a typically racist “explanation” for the Greenlanders’ disappearance. They “chose” to fail by destroying the environment and practicing violence against the Inuit. Their selfish classism and Christian bigotry also contributed to their destruction. Diamond’s pseudo-scholarship is representative of the deep-seated anti-white hatred insinuated into every nook and cranny of contemporary society.\nA few centuries later, European explorers rediscovered the island, which was recolonized by Norway beginning in 1721. In 1815 it became part of Denmark. After Germany’s invasion of that country in 1940, the US occupied Greenland until war’s end.\nToday, Greenland’s population of 57,000 consists of 88% Inuit or Inuit-Danish hybrids and 12% Europeans, mostly Danish. The Danes occupy positions as administrators, professionals, academics and skilled tradesmen.\nInterestingly, the word “Inuit” does not appear in my American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1973), nor in my unabridged Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (1981)—the heavy tome you see on its own stand in most libraries. Instead, “Eskimo”—originally the Algonquian Indian term for the northern natives—was still used, along with variants such as Eskimoid, Eskimology, and Eskimologist. The word “Saami,” for Lapps, also does not appear.\nSettled by Norwegians around 850–875 AD, Iceland is the westernmost state of Europe (Greenland is not a state), located 570 miles west of Norway and 155 miles southeast of Greenland. Indented by many long fjords, it measures about 300 mi. wide from east to west. It has many active volcanoes. Geothermal energy from hot springs is employed for heating. The country possesses one of the most advanced population genetics and geneaological research facilities in the world. deCODE genetics, a private firm, has funded the creation of a genealogy database called Íslendingabók, which attempts to cover all of Iceland’s known inhabitants.\nThe Icelandic parliament, the Althing, first convened in 930 AD, is the oldest representative assembly in Europe. Old Norse literature attained its greatest flowering in Iceland between 1000 and 1350 AD. Grœnlendinga saga and Eiríks saga describe the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland (Newfoundland).\nNorwegian rule was imposed in 1261, and thereafter Iceland belonged alternately to Norway and Denmark. Occupied by the US and Britain during WWII, it became independent in 1944. Icelandic, the official language, has changed less from Old Norse than any of the other Nordic languages.\nThe Arctic Boundary\nThe Arctic Ocean defines Europe’s continental boundary on the north. European portions of the ocean identified by specific names include the Norwegian and Greenland Seas north of Scotland, the Barents Sea north of Scandinavia and Russia, and the Kara Sea north of Russia’s Ural Mountains.\nThe Arctic Ocean boundary, Greenland to Novaya Zemyla\nRegions within the Arctic Circle were first explored between 800–1100 AD by Norse Vikings who discovered Iceland, Greenland, North America, and, in Russia, the White Sea at which they had arrived by 800, and where their influence remained strong for centuries.\nThe White Sea, an inlet of the Barents Sea in Russia whose main port is Arkhangelsk, is connected by a system of canals to the inland Baltic Sea at Leningrad. The notorious White Sea-Baltic Canal, built between 1931 and 1933 at tremendous human cost by over 100,000 concentration camp political prisoners (at least 9,000 of whom perished), is too shallow (minimum depth 11.5 ft.) to accommodate ocean-going vessels.\nThe Jewish overseers of the project, Genrikh Yagoda, Deputy Chairman of the OGPU, Matvei Berman, head of the GULAG during the 1930s, Semyon G. Firin, Chief of Construction and head of the White Sea Baltic Corrective Labor Camp Directorate, Naftaly Frenkel, the Chief of Works, Lazar Kogan, chief of the BBK Construction Directorate and his deputy Yakov Davidovich Rappoport, were awarded medals by the Politburo upon the canal’s completion, July 15, 1933.\nDue to climatic conditions, Europe’s Arctic shores are sparsely populated. Non-white residents include the Mongolid Inuits of Greenland and the pastoral, reindeer-herding Mongolid Saamis (Lapps—about 55,000 people) of northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Russian peninsula of Kola. Both groups have experienced significant white admixture.\nFew large towns exist. The largest cities are in Russia—Arkhangelsk (350,000), Murmansk (over 300,000), Norilsk (130,000), and Vorkuta (75,000); in Norway, Trondheim (165,000) and Tromsø (60,000). Other towns typically consist of small agglomerations of less than 5,000 residents.\nConstantin Korovin, \"Hammerfest: Aurora Borealis,\" 1894–1895. Oil on Canvas\nThe northernmost city in mainland Europe is Hammerfest, Norway, population 9,300, which annually experiences uninterrupted daylight from May 17–July 29, and no sun at all from November 21–January 21. Hammerfest was attacked and looted by the British navy during the Napoleonic Wars, and occupied by the Germans and bombed by the Soviet Air Force during WWII.\nThe Norwegian Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean includes the Spitsbergen group, 360 mi. north of Norway. Probably known to the Vikings, Spitsbergen was discovered in 1596 by Dutch navigator Willem Barents, who commanded several expeditions that reached Novaya Zemlya in the course of his search for a northern passage to East Asia. Barents Island and the Barents Sea are named in his honor. During WWII the Germans and Allies fought here. Svalbard Airport, Longyear provides the main point of contact with the mainland. No roads link the settlements of its 2,800 inhabitants, who travel by snowmobile, aircraft, and boat.\nCovered with ice northeast of Svalbard, the 191 islands making up Russia’s Arctic archipelago of Franz Josef Land, about 600 miles from the North Pole, is the most northerly land in Europe and the Eastern hemisphere. Though Norwegian sealers may have reached the archipelago in 1865, its official discovery is attributed to the Austrian polar explorers Julius von Payer and Karl Weyprecht in 1873. They named the archipelago in honor of Austro-Hungarian emperor Franz Joseph I. In 1931 the German airship Graf Zeppelin made an historic flight from Berlin to Hooker Island in Franz Josef Land, and while there conducted an aerial survey of the archipelago as far north as Rudolf Island.\nTurning south and slightly east from Franz Josef Land, we connect with the two  large islands known as Novaya Zemlya (New Land), which extend northward from the northern end of the Ural Mountains and are a continuation of that chain into the Arctic Ocean. A population of 50–300 reindeer-herding Nenetses (Mongolian Samoyed), who subsisted by fishing, trapping, herding, and hunting, was resettled to the mainland by the Soviets in 1952.\nOn Novaya Zemlya on October 30, 1961, the Soviets exploded, by dropping from an aircraft, Tsar Bomba (“King of Bombs”) , the largest and most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated on Earth. The hydrogen bomb yielded the equivalent of 50 megatons of TNT—after being scaled down from its original design of 100 megatons!\nAs mentioned, Novaya Zemlya is a continuation of the northern Urals to the south, thus completing our circuit of Europe’s external boundaries.\nEurope’s influence extends well beyond its formal geographic borders. European explorations, colonization, social, political, intellectual, artistic, and scientific innovations, empires, and revolutions, have transformed the world. While it is needful to comprehend Europe as a continent, the true geography of the Europeans extends to the far corners of the Earth—and beyond.\nRelated\nRelated\nIf you enjoyed this piece, and wish to encourage more like it, give a tip through Paypal .

                "Europe Map / Map of Europe - Facts, Geography, History of Europe - Worldatlas.com\nWorld Facts\nEurope History\nAs for Europe, a brief chronological account of its significant events begins during prehistoric times with the emergence of Homo sapiens (early man), roughly 40,000 years ago.\nEarly inhabitants during the Paleolithic Age, in an effort to survive, grouped together into small societies such as bands, and subsisted by gathering plants and hunting for wild animals.\nThe practice of cultivating the soil, producing crops and raising livestock began in the Neolithic Age some 9,000 years ago; stone tools were used and people began to live in small groups, or villages.\nAs man continued to journey east-to-west across Eurasia (a combination of Asia and Europe), knowledge of tools and new methods of organization arrived; civilizations flourished as metal axes and arrowheads improved survival.\nIn the 8th century BC, Greece began to emerge from the Dark Ages. Classical Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Northern Europe. In short, the Greek culture provided the foundation of modern Western culture.\nOf the great civilizations to develop in Europe, the previously mentioned Roman Empire certainly had the most lasting influence. During its often tumultuous 500-year period of innovation, it changed the continent and had a profound and lasting influence on the development of modern architecture, language, law and religion.\nAfter its collapse, the Eastern Roman Empire survived (285-1450) as the Byzantine Empire. In Western Europe, a wide series of tribes and tribal alliances moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former Roman Empire; small kingdoms were established, and the geography of Western Europe was about to change.\nThe Kingdom of the Franks was a southeastern European territory inhabited and ruled by the Franks. They would evolve into the Kingdom of France, and parts of it would morph into the Holy Roman Empire, a forerunner to the Germany we know today.\nAnglo-Saxons soon crossed (what is now) the English Channel to southern Britain and established a series of kingdoms in what would eventually develop into the Kingdom of England by AD 927; 100 years later the Kingdoms of Poland and Hungary would also take shape.\nThe Viking Age in Northern Europe and Scandinavia spanned the late 8th to mid-13th centuries. With little interest in land acquisition, the Scandinavian (Norse) Vikings aggressively explored Europe for trade and riches. The Vikings also reached Iceland, Greenland, Newfoundland and Anatolia (Turkey).\nThe Normans (a Viking people) gave their name to Normandy, a region in northern France. Initially emerging in the first half of the 10th century, they had a significant impact on many parts of Europe, from the Norman conquest of England to southern Italy and Sicily.\nBy the end of the 15th century, great powers emerged in Europe, with England, France, The Netherlands, Portugal and Spain playing predominant roles in global affairs from the 15th century onward, especially after the beginning of colonialism.\nThe European colonial period, the 1500s to the mid-1900s, was the era when the European powers mentioned above established colonies in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European nations, at various times, controlled the Americas (north and south), most of Africa, Oceania and large portions of Asia.\nAs people craved freedom across the globe, the European colonial era began to fall apart. Specifically the British Empire, the first genuinely global empire, began to lose its powers in Africa, India and much of the Middle East, and they soon crumbled away.\nAlso damaging to the continent were World Wars I and II, as they were largely focused upon Europe. The enormous costs of both wars greatly contributed to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs, and some Eastern European countries have not yet fully recovered.\nAfter the Berlin Wall came down on November 9, 1989, and after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Europe certainly changed for the better. European cultures and factions soon integrated, the Council of Europe was formed and the European Union (EU) blossomed in Western Europe.\nToday, it's safe to say that Europe is a major economical and political center of power. As for its people, they are an innovative, optimistic and resilient group who changed our world for the better more than once, and surely they will do it again.\nEurope Geography Facts\nFor additional geography details please use the yellow navigation bar at the top of this page.

Blanc in France and Italy\nEurope's lowest point is Lemmefjord in Denmark\nEurope Geography Notes\nThe Russian landmass west of the Ural Mountains is commonly referred to as European Russia in most educational atlases, and by the vast majority of geography experts. It is not a separate country, but rather called that because of its longterm political, cultural and geographical blending with the bordering European countries. For reference purposes it is shown above, however, the entire country (as a whole) is still considered part of the continent of Asia.\nEuropean Russia comprising roughly 3,960,000 sq. km (1,528,560 sq. miles) and spans across approximately 40% of Europe. Its Eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the South it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. Note that nearly 77% of the entire Russian population (about 110,000,000 people out of an approximate total Russian population of 141,000,000) lives in European Russia.\nEurope Information\nEurope weather forecasts and current conditions\nEurope Map\nEurope is the planet's 6th largest continent AND includes 47 countries and assorted dependencies, islands and territories. Europe's recognized surface area covers about 9,938,000 sq km (3,837,083 sq mi) or 2% of the Earth's surface, and about 6.8% of its land area.\nIn exacting geographic definitions, Europe is really not a continent, but part of the peninsula of Eurasia which includes all of Europe and Asia. However, it's still widely referred to as an individual continent.\nThe European continent, bordered by numerous bodies of water, is separated from Asia by Russia's Ural Mountains and by the Caspian and Black Seas. It is separated from Africa by the Mediterranean Sea.\nEuropean Topographical Map\nA topographic map highlights hills, mountains and valleys of a specific land area by exaggerated shading rather than by using contour lines.

It         shares borders with fourteen other countries and has coastlines on the         Arctic and Pacific Oceans. With a total area of about 17,075,200 square         kilometers (6,592,771 square miles), it is nearly twice the size of the         United States. Russia is administratively divided into forty-nine         oblasts, twenty-one republics, ten autonomous okrugs, six krays, two         federal cities, and one autonomous oblast.\n2 TERRITORIES AND DEPENDENCIES\nA small portion of Russia, the Kaliningrad Oblast, is located in Eastern         Europe between Poland and Lithuania. There are no overseas dependencies         of Russia.\n3 CLIMATE\nIt is said that Russia has only two seasons: summer and winter. Though         this is a slight exaggeration, the statement accurately characterizes         the country's harsh climate with its long, cold winters and         short, cool summers. These conditions are owing to Russia's         location in the high northerly latitudes. More than half the country         lies above 60° north latitude, with only relatively small areas         below 50° north. Furthermore, the high mountains that form         Russia's southern border effectively block out warm air masses.         The predominant movement of the country's weather systems from         east to west essentially nullifies any moderating influence the warm           waters of the Pacific Ocean might have on the climate. In winter,         Siberia lies under a vast high-pressure cell centered in Mongolia, which         keeps the region enveloped in frigid air. The magnitude of this cold is         not easy to grasp. Soil in the far northern permafrost can be frozen         several hundred meters deep. Even into southern Siberia, the land is         covered by snow for more than six months. The annual average temperature         for most of Siberia is below freezing. For the majority of European         Russia, the average is only somewhat higher.\nIn summer, warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean is able to push east         to central Siberia, under the influence of a prevailing low-pressure         system. That area thus receives moisture-bearing air that delivers         fairly high amounts of precipitation. Russia's short growing         season relies heavily upon this rainfall to water its crops;         unfortunately, distribution of the moisture in many areas is often         irregular and unpredictable. Droughts are not uncommon, especially in         early summer. On the other hand, heavy rains in middle and late summer         may compromise harvesting. In the east, late-summer Pacific air can         bring monsoon-like rainfall, with disastrous effects.\nOverall, lack of sunshine characterizes the Russian climate. Overcast         skies are the rule, especially in winter. In December, for example,         Moscow typically experiences twenty-three days of cloud cover. Sunless         winter days are the rule throughout the nation.\nRussia's climate zones lie in easily distinguishable belts that         run from east to west across the whole country. In the far north, Novaya         Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, and numerous smaller Arctic islands experience         a polar desert climate. Below this, a tundra climate predominates for at         least 100 kilometers (60 miles) south, extending up into the steep         mountain slopes far to the east. Next, a broad subarctic zone passes         southward as far as St. Petersburg in the west, crosses the Urals, and         takes in nearly all the rest of Siberia. Last is a wide belt of cold,         dry steppe climate starting at the Black Sea, crossing the North         Caucasian Plain, moving through the lower Volga Valley and the southern         Urals into Siberia.\nREGIONAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\n-16°C to -9°C (3°F to 16°F)\n13°C to 23°C (55°F to 73°F)\nVladivostok\n-18°C to -11°C (0°F to 13°F)\n16°C to 22°C (60°F to 71°F)\nVerkhoyansk\n-32°C (-26°F)\n13°C to 37°C (56°F to 98°F)\nMost of Russia experiences only modest precipitation, but the averages         vary by region. On the Great European Plain, averages decrease from more         than 80 centimeters (30 inches) in the west to less than 40 centimeters         (16 inches) on the Caspian Sea shoreline. Siberia uniformly sees annual         precipitation ranging from 50 to 80 centimeters (20 to 32 inches),         although amounts are generally less than 30 centimeters (12 inches) in         extreme northeastern Siberia. At high elevations, precipitation totals         may reach 100 centimeters (40 inches) or more, but in the valleys they         average less than 30 centimeters (12 inches).\n4 TOPOGRAPHIC REGIONS\nRussia can be categorized into several large regions. From west to east,         they are the Great European Plain; the Ural Mountains; the mountain         systems and ranges along much of Russia's southern border; and         Siberia, which includes the West Siberian Plain, the Central Siberian         Plateau, and the mountain ranges of northeastern Siberia and the         Kamchatka Peninsula.\nMost of Russia is located on the Eurasian Tectonic Plate, but eastern         Russia is on the North American Plate. The exact boundary between the         two plates is uncertain. The Pacific Plate is located off of         Russia's eastern coastline. The movement of these three plates         against each other is a cause of significant earthquakes and volcanoes         in this region, especially on Kamchatka. Seismic activity is also common         in the Caucasus Mountains in the southwest.\n5 OCEANS AND SEAS\nSeacoast and Undersea Features\nThe majority of Russia's coastline is on the Arctic Ocean and its         seas, including the White Sea, Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, East         Siberian Sea, and the Chukchi Sea. Located almost entirely north of the         Arctic Circle, much of the water here remains frozen for the better part         of the year. One exception is the area in                    the far west, where the Gulf Stream current warms the waters of the         Barents Sea near the Kola Peninsula, allowing the port of Murmansk to         function year-round. The eastern coastline of Russia lies on the Pacific         Ocean and its seas, including the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, and a         portion of the Sea of Japan. Western Russia has short coastlines along         the Baltic Sea (in northern Europe) and the Black Sea (an inland sea         between southeastern Europe and Asia), both of which are seas of the         Atlantic Ocean.\nSea Inlets and Straits\nThe Gulf of Ob' and the estuary of the Yenisey River are inlets         of the coastline of the Kara Sea. A channel called the Proliv Dmitrya         Lapteva connects the Laptev Sea to the East Siberian Sea. Long Strait         near the northeast coast connects the East Siberian Sea to the Chukchi         Sea and separates the mainland from Wrangel Island. The Bering Strait         separates Siberia and Alaska by a mere 86 kilometers (53 miles) and         connects the Chukchi Sea to the Bering Sea. Shelikhova Bay is a deep         inlet of the Sea of Okhotsk. The Gulf of Anadyr, near the northeastern         tip of Russia, is an inlet of the Bering Sea. Russia's principal         Pacific Ocean port, Vladivostok, is found on Peter the Great Bay, within         the Sea of Japan. The Tatar Strait connects the Sea of Okhotsk to the         Sea of Japan. The Gulf of Finland in the west is an inlet of the Baltic         Sea. St. Petersburg is located at its apex. The Sea of Azov is an inlet         of the Black Sea, located at the southwestern Russian border.\nIslands and Archipelagos\nMany islands lie within the Arctic and Pacific Oceans off the shores of         Russia. Franz Josef Land is comprised of about one hundred small islands         in the Arctic Ocean; it is the northern-most           part of Russia and is among the north-ernmost lands on Earth. Other         large Arctic islands are Novaya Zemlya, Vaygach Island, Wrangel Island, and the Severnaya Zemlya and New Siberian Islands groups. Many small         islands and island chains are scattered among these larger groups.\nIn the Pacific, the Kuril Islands curve southwest from the Kamchatka         Peninsula to Japan. Although the Kuril Islands are under Russian         administration, Japan and Russia dispute ownership of the four         southernmost islands. Also lying in the Pacific is Sakhalin, a large         island that separates the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan.\nCoastal Features\nNo country in the world can surpass Russia's 37,653 kilometers         (23,396 miles) of coastline. Yet most of this coastline is so far north         that it is frozen for much of the year. Despite the fact that frozen         harbors mean Russia has very few outlets to the ocean that remain open         all year, Russian shipping and fishing thrives on all its seas.\nThe coastlines contain many peninsulas and capes. Gydan Peninsula lies         between the Gulf of Ob' and the estuary of the Yenisey River.         Continuing to the east, the Taymyr Peninsula extends north, reaching         mainland Russia's northernmost point at Cape Chelyuskin.\nThe Chukchi Peninsula stretches out to become Russia's         easternmost point, with the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean to the north         and the Bering Sea of the Pacific Ocean to the south. Further south is         the large Kamchatka Peninsula. Kamchatka encloses the Sea of Okhotsk to         the west.\nDID YOU KNOW?\nRussia was even larger in the past than it is today. Russia controlled           Finland, Alaska, and parts of modern-day Poland at various times in           history. After World War I (1914–18), Russia technically ceased           to be an independent country, instead becoming part of the Union of           Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R., or the Soviet Union). Russia was           by far the largest of the republics that made up the Soviet Union,           however, and was considered to be the ruling power of that nation. The           Soviet Union started to dissolve in 1991. Eventually, many nations           within the Soviet Union became independent of Russia.\n6 INLAND LAKES\nThe Caspian Sea, on Russia's southern border between Europe and         Asia, is not a true sea; it is actually a saltwater lake and the largest         inland body of water in the world. The Caspian is held in a vast land         depression with no outlet to any ocean. Although many rivers drain into         it, water escapes only through evaporation. The Caspian's         salinity results from accumulated salts. The sea extends approximately         1,210 kilometers (750 miles) from north to south and 210 to 436         kilometers (130 to 271 miles) from east to west. Its area is 371,000         square kilometers (143,000 square miles). Its mean depth is about 170         meters (550 feet), with the deepest areas in the south.\nMost other Russian lakes were formed by glaciation. The largest such         lakes in European Russia are Ladoga (17,703 square kilometers/ 6,835         square miles) and Onega (9,609 square kilometers/3,701 square miles),         northeast of St. Petersburg. They are also the two largest lakes in all         of Europe (since the Caspian Sea is generally not counted as a lake).         Other large lakes in western Russia include Lake Peipus on the Estonian         border and the reservoirs of the Volga River.\nLake Baikal in southern Siberia is the largest lake in Russia and the         largest lake in Asia (excluding the Caspian Sea). It is 632 kilometers         (392 miles) long and 59 kilometers (32 miles) wide, with a surface area         of 30,510 square kilometers (11,870 square miles). It has a maximum         depth of 1,742 meters (5,715 feet), making it the deepest body of         freshwater on Earth. Due to its great depth, Lake Baikal also has the         greatest volume of any freshwater lake. It is said to contain one-fifth         of Earth's fresh surface water. Other large Siberian lakes         include Lakes Taymyr, Chany, and Khanka and the Novosibirsk, Bratsk, and         Zeya Reservoirs. There also are many smaller lakes.\n7 RIVERS AND WATERFALLS\nMost of Russia's urban population lives along the banks of the         nation's many rivers. The most important commercial river in         Russia is the Volga, which is also the longest river in Europe. The         Volga begins in the hills west of Moscow and flows southeastward for         3,689 kilometers (2,293 miles) to the Caspian Sea. Four of Russia's largest cities are located on its banks: Nizhniy         Novgorod, Samara, Kazan', and Volgograd. The Kama River flows         west out of the southern Urals and into the Volga. This also is a major         waterway for both Russia and Europe.\nAlso located in European Russia are the Dnieper and the Don Rivers.         Although the Dnieper flows mainly through Belarus and                    Ukraine, it has headwaters in the hills west of Moscow. The Don flows         from its origins in the Central Russian Upland south of Moscow for 1,860         kilometers (1,153 miles) before emptying into the Sea of Azov at         Rostov-na-Donu.\nFurther east is the Ural River, which flows south from the Ural         Mountains into Kazakhstan before reaching the Caspian Sea. The Ural         River is traditionally considered part of the boundary between Europe         and Asia.\nA number of major rivers drain into the Pacific and Arctic Oceans from         the Siberian plateau and mountain areas in the east. The           Irtysh-Ob' river system flows through the West Siberian Plain,         emptying into the Arctic at the Gulf of Ob'. The Irtysh is the         longer of the two rivers, but is a tributary to the Ob'. Together         they have a length of 5,380 kilometers (3,335 miles), making them the         longest river system in Russia.\nOn the far side of the Central Siberian Plateau is the Lena, the longest         individual river in Russia at 4,400 kilometers (2,700 miles). It too         empties into the Arctic, and it has many large tributaries including the         Aldan, Vitim, and Vilyui. The third great Arctic river, the Yenisey         (4,000 kilometers/2,480 miles), flows across the Central Siberian         Plateau. Its largest tributary, the Lower Tunguska, is itself roughly         3,226 kilometers (2,000 miles) long. Other major tributaries include the         Stony Tunguska and Angara.\nThe same river systems that account for such an enormous flow of water         into the Arctic Ocean are also responsible for creating vast swamps in         the West Siberian Plain. Snow and ice in the warmer regions, where the         rivers have their sources, thaw well before the northern regions,         causing great flooding to the north. The Vasyugan'ye Swamp in the         center of the West Siberian Plain, for example, covers 48,000 square         kilometers (18,500 square feet). The same effect can be observed with         other Siberian river systems.\nThe Amur River (2,874 kilometers/1,768 miles) is the most important         Siberian river flowing into the Pacific Ocean. Its major tributaries are         the Argun, Ussuri, and Shilka. The Amur River, with its primary         tributary the Ussuri River, comprises a significant section of the         boundary between Russia and China.\n8 DESERTS\nThere are no desert regions in Russia.\n9 FLAT AND ROLLING TERRAIN\nIn all nearly 10 percent of Russian territory can be classified as         swampland. Much of this is concentrated in the West Siberian Plain,         which lies between the Ural Mountains and the Yenisey River. This plain         is a vast area of lowlands, probably the largest expanse of flat land         anywhere in the world. It stretches from the steppes of Central Asia in         the south to the Arctic Ocean in the north, covering a region nearly         1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) wide. Flat and poorly drained, these         lowlands feature many swamps, marshes, and peat bogs, with significant         oil and natural gas deposits in their central and northern regions.\nDID YOU KNOW?\nThe areas now known as Siberia and Alaska were once connected by a           stretch of land that surfaced during the Ice Ages, an area that           researchers have called the Bering Land Bridge or Beringia.           Archaeologists believe that the first ancestors of the Native           Americans crossed this bridge from Asia into North America more than           thirteen thousand years ago. Over time, as the Bering and Chukchi Seas           rose, they covered Beringia. Remnants of the region can still be seen           at the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve on Seward Peninsula in           Alaska.\nThe Ural Mountains separate two vast plains: the Great European Plain         and the even larger West Siberian Plain. Both of these so-called plains         contain a wide variety of terrain, including vast forests, swamps, and         stretches           of tundra. The plains also contain many areas of grassland and         farmland, however, especially the Great European Plain.\nThe central portion of the Great European Plain between St. Petersburg         and the Ukrainian border features a mixed forest of both conifers and         deciduous trees. Oak, beech, maple, and hornbeam are the primary         broad-leaf tree species. Moving south, the mixed forest passes through a         narrow zone of forest steppe, which is 150 kilometers (95 miles) wide,         on average, before giving way to a zone of true steppe.\nThe steppe is a broad band of nearly treeless, grassy plains that         extends across Hungary, Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan before         ending in Manchuria. Although historically presented as the typical         Russian landscape, the steppe in Russia proper is in fact quite small,         located mainly northwest of the Greater Caucasus Mountains and         stretching across the southern Volga Valley, the southern Urals, and         parts of western Siberia.\nIsolated pockets of steppe can also be found in the mountain valleys of         southeastern Siberia. Moderate temperatures and normally adequate levels         of sunshine and moisture give the steppe zone relatively favorable         conditions for agriculture, although precipitation here can be         unpredictable, sometimes even catastrophically dry.\nTundra makes up about 10 percent of Russian land, a treeless and marshy         plain that lies along Russia's northernmost zone. The tundra         stretches from the Finnish border to the Bering Strait, then extends         south along the Pacific coast to the Kamchatka Peninsula. The North         Siberian and Kolyma lowlands are entirely made up of tundra. Only         mosses, lichens, dwarf willows and shrubs can grow on the permafrost and         survive the long, harsh, sunless winters. In summer, dusk comes at         midnight and dawn follows within minutes. The powerful Siberian rivers         that cut across the tundra toward the Arctic Ocean do a poor job of         draining the region, due to partial and intermittent thawing. The most         important physical process at work in the tundra is frost weathering, a         vestige of the glaciation that shaped it during the last Ice Age.\nDID YOU KNOW?\nThe areas now known as Siberia and Alaska were once connected by a           stretch of land that surfaced during the Ice Ages, an area that           researchers have called the Bering Land Bridge or Beringia.           Archaeologists believe that the first ancestors of the Native           Americans crossed this bridge from Asia into North America more than           thirteen thousand years ago. Over time, as the Bering and Chukchi Seas           rose, they covered Beringia. Remnants of the region can still be seen           at the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve on Seward Peninsula in           Alaska.\nThere are many regions of hills and uplands in Russia. The Valdai Hills         are the most noteworthy. Although not particularly tall (from 182 to 304         meters/600 to 1000 feet in elevation), they are among the highest         summits located in the Great European Plain of western Russia. Many         important rivers have their source there, including the Volga.\n10 MOUNTAINS AND VOLCANOES\nWith nine major mountain ranges, Russia can be considered among the most         mountainous countries in the world. Eastern Russia is by far more         mountainous than the west, while the center section of the country is         primarily low plains.\nThe Urals are perhaps the best known of Russia's mountain ranges,         as they define the boundary between Asia to the east and Europe to the         west. A lengthy range, the Urals extend 2,100 kilometers (1,300 miles)         from the northern border of Kazakhstan all the way to the Arctic Ocean.         The highest peak, Mount Narodnaya, is only 1,894 meters (6,212 feet) in         elevation, however. The Urals have never offered any significant barrier         to travel.\nLocated between the Black and Caspian Seas, the Caucasus Mountains         consist of two major chains separated by lowlands. The northern Greater         Caucasus range forms most of the border between Russia, Azerbaijan, and         Georgia, as well as marking the boundary between Asia to the south and         Europe to the north. These mountain systems are made up of granite,         other crystalline rocks, and some volcanic formations. Elevations in the         Greater Caucasus reach a maximum of 5,633 meters (18,481 feet) at the         extinct volcano Mount El'brus, the highest peak both in Russia         and on the continent of Europe.\nRussia's other mountains are far to the east. The Altay Shan and         Sayan Mountains are found in the area north of Mongolia, west of Lake         Baikal. Further east are the Yablonovyy Range and Stanovoy Mountains.         They follow much of the southern border of central and eastern Siberia         on toward the Pacific Ocean, where they join the other eastern ranges.         The Altay Shan are the tallest of these; they include Mount Pelukha         (4,619 meters/15,157 feet). The other ranges average less than 3,048         meters (10,000 feet) in height.\nThe topography east of the Lena River is predominantly mountainous, with         the elevations becoming higher and more rugged farther to the east.         Major ranges in this region are Verkhoyanskiy, Cherskiy, Kolyma, Koryak,         and Sredinnyy. The easternmost ranges feature live volcanoes. As many as         120 volcanoes dot the Kamchatka Peninsula, and no fewer than 23 are         active. Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the highest of these, reaches 4,750 meters         (15,584 feet).\nMoving offshore, these same mountains form the Kuril Islands, where         thirty of one hundred volcanoes are active. Across the Sea of Okhotsk,         in Russia's southeasternmost area, there are several low mountain         ranges, including the Sikhote-Alin' Mountains and the mountains         of Sakhalin Island.\n11 CANYONS AND CAVES\nThough there are many caves throughout the country of Russia, geological         information or maps concerning them are not easy to obtain. One of the         most famous of the many caves is Kapova Cave, which is known for its         Paleolithic paintings of mammoths, rhinos, horses, and bison.         Excavations from the two-level cavern uncovered human remains as well as         animal bones and charcoal, indicating that people once lived there.\nDID YOU KNOW?\nIn an area known as the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly, near Ukraine, vast           iron-ore deposits affect Earth's magnetic field.\nAnother famous site is the Kungur Ice Cave, located near the town of         Kungur, southeast of Perm. It contains over 6,000 meters (19,685 feet)         of passageways. The entire depth of the cavern, however, has not been         completely explored. The cave features many large columns of stalagmites         and huge icicle stalactites.\n12 PLATEAUS AND MONOLITHS\nThe Central Siberian Plateau is an enormous stretch of rolling land         between the Yenisey and the Lena Rivers. Heights of this vast plateau         range from 500 to 700 meters (1,600 to 2,300 feet) on average. Its         surface is eroded by the many rivers, some forming deep canyons. Layers         of sedimentary rock, subsequently intruded by volcanic lava, were         deposited long ago on top of igneous and metamorphic rock. Within the         layers of sedimentary rock are rich deposits of coal.\n13 MAN-MADE FEATURES\nSeveral canals connect most of European Russia's rivers. These         rivers provide a vital transportation system, carrying fully two-thirds         of the nation's inland water traffic. Because of one series of         canals, it is possible to travel from St. Petersburg to Moscow entirely         by boat.\nRussia's many rivers give the nation a great potential for         hydroelectric power. In fact, Russia already has four of the ten largest         hydroelectric plants in the world. The SayanoShushensk Dam on the         Yenisey River is part of the fourth-largest plant and is also the         twelfth-highest dam in the world, with a height of 242 meters (794         feet). The Krasnoyarsk Dam belongs to the fifth-largest hydroelectric         plant in the world, while the Bratsk Dam and the Ust-Ilim Dam are eighth         and tenth, respectively. The Saratov Dam on the Volga River is also         listed as one of the world's largest dams.\n14 FURTHER READING\nClark, Miles. \"A Russian Voyage.\" National Geographic , June 1994, 114-138.\nEdwards, Mike. \"Siberia: In from the Cold.\" National Geographic , March 1990, 2-39.\nJacobsen, Karen.

                "The Eiffel Tower (  ; , ) is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.\n\nConstructed in 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015.\n\nThe tower is 324 m tall, about the same height as an 81- building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 m on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 17 ft. Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second-tallest structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\n\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually only accessible by lift.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\n\nThe design of the Eiffel Tower was the product of Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel, after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.  In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".  Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.\n\nThe new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the ; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise, \n\nLittle progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grévy was re-elected as president of France and Édouard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars. On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.\n\nAfter some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself. \n\nArtists' protest\n\nThe proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Charles Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887:\n\nGustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"  These criticisms were also dealt with by Édouard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, ironically saying,  \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.\n\nIndeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\" \n\nSome of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced. Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible. \n\nBy 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.  Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.\n\nConstruction\n\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m long and 6 m in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m  to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\n\nEach shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm in diameter and  long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.  The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within  and angles worked out to one second of arc. The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined together using 2.5 million rivets.\n\nAt first the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level, construction was paused in order to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\" and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.  At this stage, a small \"creeper\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888. Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments in order to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees, only one person died thanks to Eiffel's stringent safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens.\n\nFile:Construction tour eiffel.JPG|The start of the erection of the metalwork.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel2.JPG|7 December 1887: Construction of the legs with scaffolding.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel3.JPG|20 March 1888: Completion of the first level.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel4.JPG|15 May 1888: Start of construction on the second stage.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel5.JPG|21 August 1888: Completion of the second level.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel6.JPG|26 December 1888: Construction of the upper stage.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel7.JPG|15 March 1889: Construction of the cupola.\n\nLifts\n\nEquipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.Vogel, pp. 20–21.\n\nConstructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs.Vogel, p. 28. Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around  diameter sprockets. Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains.\n\nInstalling lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis Brothers & Company submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.Vogel, pp. 23–24. Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.\n\nThe car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. Motive power was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram  long and  in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of : this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a block and tackle but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.\n\nThe original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Léon Edoux. A pair of 81 m hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car only travelled half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers. \n\nInauguration and the 1889 exposition\n\nThe main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, Émile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustré, completed the ascent. At 2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level. \n\nThere was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.\nTickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,  and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.\n\nAfter dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.\n\nOn the second level, the French newspaper Le Figaro had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, Le Figaro de la Tour, was made. There was also a pâtisserie.\n\nAt the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower. Gustave Eiffel described some of the responses as vraiment curieuse (\"truly curious\"). \n\nFamous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison. Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.  Edison signed the guestbook with this message: \n\nEiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris. The City had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for communication purposes, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit.\n\nEiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies. \n\nSubsequent events\n\nFor the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism to the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism. At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.\n\nOn 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour. \n\nMany innovations took place at the Eiffel Tower in the early 20th century. In 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.Theodor Wulf. Physikalische Zeitschrift. Contains results of the four-day-long observation done by Theodor Wulf at the top of the Eiffel Tower in 1910. Just two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 metres) to demonstrate his parachute design.  In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.  From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citroën adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time. In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed. \n\nOn two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist Victor Lustig \"sold\" the tower for scrap metal.  A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station.  On 2 May 1929, a bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg.  In 1930, the tower lost the title of the world's tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed.  In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed. \n\nUpon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the French. The tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946.  In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist the swastika, but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one. When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. In August 1944, when the Allies were nearing Paris, Hitler ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order.  On 25 June, before the Germans had been driven out of Paris, the Nazi flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the French Naval Museum, who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans.\n\nOn 3 January 1956, a fire started in the television transmitter, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top. In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, André Malraux.  A year later, due to increasing visitor numbers, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar.\n\nAccording to interviews, in 1967, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with Charles de Gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during Expo 67. The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location. \n\nIn 1982, the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new emergency staircases were installed, replacing the original spiral staircases. In 1983, the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven Otis lift to serve the Jules Verne restaurant. The Fives-Lille lifts in the east and west legs, fitted in 1899, were extensively refurbished in 1986. The cars were replaced, and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts. The motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system.  A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.\n\nOn 31 March 1984, Robert Moriarty flew a Beechcraft Bonanza under the tower.  In 1987, A.J. Hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police.  On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Hervé Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower.  Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump.\n\nOn 31 December 1999, for its \"Countdown to the Year 2000\" celebration, flashing lights and high-powered searchlights were installed on the tower. Fireworks were set off all over it. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour. \n\nOn 31 December 2000, the lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing.\n\nThe tower received its th guest on 28 November 2002.  The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7 million visitors since 2003.  In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level.  A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment. \n\nDesign\n\nMaterial\n\nThe puddled iron (wrought iron) of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons,  and the addition of lifts, shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately 10,100 tons.  As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300 tons of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, 125 m on each side, to a depth of only  assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8 tons per cubic metre.  Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324 m x 125 m x 125 m) would contain  tons of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18 cm due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun. \n\nWind considerations\n\nWhen it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team – experienced bridge builders – understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them. In an interview with the newspaper Le Temps published on 14 February 1887, Eiffel said:\n\nHe used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. Close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape.  All parts of the tower were over-designed to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework.  In the years since it was completed, engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. The most recent, devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English, is described as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower sways by up to 9 centimetres (3.5 in) in the wind. \n\nAccommodation\n\nWhen originally built, the first level contained three restaurants—one French, one Russian and one Flemish—and an \"Anglo-American Bar\". After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. A promenade  wide ran around the outside of the first level. At the top, there were laboratories for various experiments, and a small apartment reserved for Gustave Eiffel to entertain guests, which is now open to the public, complete with period decorations and lifelike mannequins of Eiffel and some of his notable guests.\n\nIn May 2016, an apartment was created on the first level to accommodate four competition winners during the UEFA Euro 2016 football tournament in Paris in June. The apartment has a kitchen, two bedrooms, a lounge, and views of Paris landmarks including the Seine, the Sacre Coeur, and the Arc de Triomphe. \n\nPassenger lifts\n\nThe arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower's history. Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift.\n\nEngraved names\n\nGustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower. Eiffel chose this \"invocation of science\" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986–87 by the , a company operating the tower.\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to perfectly complement the Parisian sky. It was originally reddish-brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \"Eiffel Tower Brown\".\n\nThe only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre's sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition. \n\nOne of the great Hollywood movie clichés is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower. In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to seven storeys, only a small number of tall buildings have a clear view of the tower.\n\nMaintenance\n\nMaintenance of the tower includes applying 60 tons of paint every seven years to prevent it from rusting. The tower has been completely repainted at least 19 times since it was built. Lead paint was still being used as recently as 2001 when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment. \n\nTourism\n\nTransport\n\nThe nearest Paris Métro station is Bir-Hakeim and the nearest RER station is Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel.  The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Pont d'Iéna.\n\nPopularity\n\nMore than 250 million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889. In 2015, there were 6.91 million visitors.  The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world.  An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day which can result in long queues.  Tickets can be purchased online to avoid the long queues.\n\nRestaurants\n\nThe tower has two restaurants:  on the first level, and , a gourmet restaurant with its own lift on the second level. This restaurant has one star in the Michelin Red Guide. It is run by the multi-Michelin star chef Alain Ducasse  and owes its name to the famous science-fiction writer Jules Verne.\n\nReplicas\n\nAs one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, the Eiffel Tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers. An early example is Blackpool Tower in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town. It opened in 1894 and is 158 metres (518 ft) tall.  Tokyo Tower in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower. \n\nThere are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the Paris Las Vegas, Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at Kings Island, Ohio, and Kings Dominion, Virginia, amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in Durango, Mexico that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe. \n\nIn 2011, the TV show Pricing the Priceless on the National Geographic Channel speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480 million to build. \n\nCommunications\n\nThe tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C.  Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nFM radio\n\nDigital television\n\nA television antenna was first installed on the tower in 1957, increasing its height by 18.7 m (61.4 ft). Work carried out in 2000 added a further 5.3 m (17.4 ft), giving the current height of 324 m (1,063 ft). Analogue television signals from the Eiffel Tower ceased on 8 March 2011.\n\nIllumination copyright\n\nThe tower and its image have long been in the public domain.  In June 1990, however, a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary was an \"original visual creation\" protected by copyright. The Court of Cassation, France's judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992.  The  (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright.  As a result, it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries. \n\nThe imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the  (SNTE), Stéphane Dieu, commented in 2005: \"It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve\".  SNTE made over €1 million from copyright fees in 2002.  However, it could also be used to prohibit the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the tower.\n\nFrench doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented,  a reasoning akin to the de minimis rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nAs a global landmark, the Eiffel Tower is featured in films, video games and TV shows.\n\nIn a commitment ceremony in 2007, Erika Eiffel, an American woman, \"married\" the Eiffel Tower; her relationship with the tower has been the subject of extensive global publicity. \n\nTaller structures\n\nAlthough it was the world's tallest structure when completed in 1889, the Eiffel Tower has lost its standing both as the tallest lattice tower and as the tallest structure in France.\n\nLattice towers taller than the Eiffel Tower\n\nStructures in France taller than the Eiffel Tower"

                "Jonah Sent to Nineveh\nJonah Sent to Nineveh\nJ. R. Miller, 1910\n \nIt was not by any means an easy task that was      given to Jonahï¿½his mission to Nineveh. There was no Board of Missions behind him with ample funds. There were no comfortable missionary      quarters in Nineveh to receive him. There were no fine railroads to      carry him there. The journey was long, the duty was hard and full of danger.      It is quite easy to sit in our pleasant rooms and criticize the      prophet; butï¿½would YOU have wanted to go, if you had been in his place?\nJonah suddenly conceived a strong desire to go to Tarshish, instead of to Nineveh. Distinctly it is said he did      itï¿½to flee from the presence of Jehovah. Perhaps Tarshish needed a preacher      tooï¿½but that was not where the Lord wanted Jonah to go at that time. It is      never a question of where we want or do not want to goï¿½but of where God wants us to go. A reason for Jonah's reluctance comes out later.      He didn't believe God would destroy Nineveh; that is, he believed the      Ninevites would repent and God would spare them. The fact is, he didn't want      these heathen people to be saved! He wanted God to destroy them. He was an Israelite with strong prejudices, and on principle didn't      believe in foreign missions. He considered the heathen fit      only to be destroyed, certainly not fit to be saved in the same company with him!\nWe will call this a very unworthy attitude for a prophet      to haveï¿½and surely it was. But does no good, clean, respectable, well-to-do      modern Christian, ever have a like feeling toward wicked, dirty,      degraded, good-for-nothing sinners? Just think out the answer, and don't      look too far away from home for your facts.\n\"He found a ship going to Tarshish; and so he paid the      fare.\" He did not want to go to Nineveh, so he thought he would go on a trip in another direction. It is a very sad piece of history. Was there      never a young minister, just through the seminary, whom God wanted to      go to some heathen countryï¿½but who didn't want to go, and made excuse to go      somewhere else in place? Was there never a minister whom God called to some      lowly, needy field among the poor or the outcastï¿½but who had a \"providential\" call about the same timeï¿½to a rich or a fashionable church, which he took instead? Are there no good Christian men and      womenï¿½not prophets or ministersï¿½who have had \"calls\" to duties which were      hard and repulsive, perhaps attended with danger or requiring sacrifice,      which they did not acceptï¿½running off toward Tarshish instead?\nIt is well enough to look honestly at Jonah's sinï¿½but      we must not exhaust our vision on him. It is no doubt a great deal easier to      be honest with other people's sins than with our ownï¿½but it is with      our OWN SINSï¿½that we have the chief business. None of us shall ever be      punished for Jonah's sinsï¿½but for our own we shall beï¿½unless we repent of      them. The fact is, there is a great deal more running away from distasteful dutyï¿½than we dream of; and the condemnation strikes close      home with many of us. Do we never shirk a task, that we know in our soul      we ought to perform? Do we never make errands for ourselves as excuses for      not doing errands that God has assigned to us? Well, that was what      Jonah didï¿½he made believe that business called him to Spain, to get      clear of going to Nineveh.\n\"The word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time.\" He had failed dishonorably the first timeï¿½but God gave him a second chance to do his work. This shows the divine patience with      us. Strict justice would have left Jonah at the bottom of the seaï¿½or      in the maw of the great fish; but grace preserved his life and      restored him to begin again. He had now gone through a discipline which left him submissive and ready to obey. This is the way      God often deals with people in our own days. When they disobey Him, He does      not cast them offï¿½but puts them under some discipline, sometimes sore      and painfulï¿½to teach them obedience, and then tries them again.\nMany of us have to be whipped to duty; but God is      very patient with us. Most of us owe all we are to His disciplines.      By these, even our sins and falls become blessings to us. We      should be very thankful to God, too, for these second chances that He      gives usï¿½when we have failed to improve the first chance. Very few people      make of their lives what God first wanted them to make. Then He sets them      another lesson, that they may try again. Perhaps the second is not so      beautiful or so noble as the first; still it is good, and if we are diligent      and faithfulï¿½we can find blessing in it and make something noble even yet of      our life. Most of us have to be sent more than once on our errands for God. Happy are we if we go even at the second bidding, although      it is far better that we go at the first.\nThe command to Jonah was very definite. \"Get up! Go to      the great city of Nineveh and preach the message that I tell you!\" God knows      just how He wants His work done. One of the most important things in a servantï¿½is that he shall do precisely what his master bids him to      do. We are too apt to be careless about exactness in obedience. A      good many children err at this point in obeying their parents. They obey      them perhapsï¿½but they put very liberal construction upon their commands, and      so their obedience is very inexact. They should learn the duty of precise obedience. In all business matters there is need for the      same lesson. Railroad trains have been wrecked, with terrible loss of life,      because a telegraph operator or some other employee obeyed his order      inexactly. Wherever we are employed we should train ourselves to do our work      just as we are bidden to do it.\nOne who would tell others how to be savedï¿½must preach      just the preaching which God bids His servants preach. Bad advice has      wrecked destinies. Wrong sermons, and teaching of spiritual truth has      wrecked souls! We are not to put our own construction on God's Wordï¿½and give that to the people. We are not to talk carelessly about the divine      thoughts and teachings. We are reverently and faithfully to preach the      message that the Lord bids us to preach, without abatement, without      addition, without change!\nJonah had learned his lesson and learned it well. This      time he arose and went to Nineveh. We are not told where he was after his      deliveranceï¿½but no doubt he had a quiet time for thought and repenting. He would go over the story of his willfulness and      disobedience in the matter of going to Nineveh, and would be ashamed of his      conduct. Thus he learned humility and was ready now to do as      God might command him. Indeed, he would become eager for another opportunity      to do the work which he had first refused to do.\nThere is a story of a regiment of soldiers which in some      war had dishonored itself in some way on a certain battlefield. In a later      war the same regiment was again in the service, and at the first opportunity      they displayed most heroic courage, thus \"burning out the shame\" of the      former field. So Jonah in his humility, would long for another chance to go      for God to Nineveh, that he might wipe out the dishonor of his former      disobedience. When the command came a second timeï¿½he would rejoice. So we      see prompt obedience this time, no parleying, no quibbling, no running away.\nHe delivered his message. \"He cried, and saidï¿½in forty      days Nineveh shall be overthrown!\" The doom was announced, and forty days'      warning was given. God always gives time enough for repentance. He is      reluctant to punish. He waits to be gracious. This truthfully      represents the heart of God and His dealing with sinners. He is slow to      punishï¿½and quick to forgive. \"In forty days!\" Still it must be noticed that      the time for mercy is limited.\nThe message was heard and believed. \"The people of      Nineveh believed God.\" They believed what God said through His prophet about      their sinsï¿½and about the destruction that was swiftly coming      upon their city. This is a kind of faith that is needed everywhere just now.      God speaks very plainly in His Word about the penalties and consequences of sinï¿½but there are many who do not believe God. They sneer at the thought of judgment or eternal punishment.\nThe king and people entered heartily into the movement. \"They proclaimed a fast.\" They called upon the people of the city to turn      every one from his evil way. Their repentance was genuineï¿½so far as it went.      They did not merely put on garments of sackcloth and mourning; they turned      their faces to God and gave up their evil deeds. They humbled themselves; they confessed their sins; they cleansed their      hands of the wickedness they had been committing; they cried to God,      supplicating His mercy. It is along the same path that everyone must      walkï¿½who would find forgiveness and the turning away of God's wrath. Sins      must be given upï¿½and turned away from. Bible mercy is wonderfully      full and blessedï¿½but Bible repentance is also deep and thorough.\n\"Who knows whether God will not . . . turn away from His      fierce anger, that we perish not?\" The repentance of Nineveh was from fear,      and to escape the judgment pronounced upon them. That was as far as they      could goï¿½a mere dim hope that God might turn away from His angerï¿½if      they would turn away from their sins. That was all the gospel they      had. No promise of mercy had been made to them on any condition, so      far as we are told. They were not assured that if they repentedï¿½the      doom would be averted; they repented on the strength of the dim hope of      mercy which their own hearts suggested.\nIt is different with us. The same message which tells us      of our sins, and the penalty which is sure to be visited upon      themï¿½points us also to the cross and proclaims eternal salvation and      life to every one who will repent and believe on Christ. We are not driven      to any such mere \"perhaps\" when we see our sins and desire to be saved. We      know that if we confess our sinsï¿½God will forgive them; that if we seek the Lordï¿½we shall be saved.\nMercy was revealed at once. \"God saw their works, that      they turned from their evil way.\" God is always watching the earth, every      corner of it where a sinful soul is, and wherever there is true penitence He sees it. There is no danger that anyone ever shall repent and weep      over sinï¿½and God not know it. There is joy in the presence of the angels      when even one sinner repents. The most beautiful and precious thing on this      earth in God's sight, is the penitential tear.",
                "Jonah 1 - Jonah Runs from God\nJonah 1 - Jonah Runs from God\n \nA. Jonahï¿½s attempted escape.\n \n1. (1-2) Godï¿½s call to Jonah.\n \nNow the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, ï¿½Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it; for their wickedness has come up before Me.ï¿½\n \na. The word of the Lord came to Jonah: God spoke to Jonah in His own unique and powerful way and He told Jonah to do two things. First, go to Nineveh; second, cry out against it - that is, rebuke them for their sin and call them to repentance.\n \nb. Go to Nineveh: The city of Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire and was a large and prominent city in its day. It was not a city of Israel at all; God called Jonah to go to a pagan, Gentile city and call them to repentance.\n \ni. Ancient historians say that Nineveh was the largest city in the world at that time. It was the large, important capital of a dominating empire - surely an intimidating place to go.\n \nc. For their wickedness has come up before Me: Why did God want Jonah to go? Because God saw their wickedness. None of manï¿½s wickedness is hidden before God - He sees it all, and it may come to a point where it demands the specific warning and judgment of God.\n \n2. (3) Jonahï¿½s attempt to flee from Godï¿½s call.\n \nBut Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.\n \na. But Jonah arose to flee: Why didnï¿½t Jonah want to go to Nineveh and do what the Lord told him to do?\n \ni. It may have been because he was given a difficult job to do. Nahum 3:1-4 gives us a good idea of how wicked the people of Nineveh were. Jonah had every reason to expect that at the very best, he would be mocked and treated as a fool. He might be attacked and killed if he did what the Lord told him to do.\n \nii. It was also because Jonah didnï¿½t want the Assyrians in Nineveh to escape Godï¿½s judgment. Imagine a Jewish man in New York during World War II hearing God say, ï¿½Iï¿½m going to bring terrible judgment on Germany. I want you to go to Berlin and tell Nazi Germany to repent.ï¿½ Instead of doing it, the man heads for San Francisco and then hops on a boat for Hong Kong.\n \niii. It is easy to discuss Jonahï¿½s reasons for not doing what God told him to do, but what is our reason? God told Jonah to go and to preach; every Christian has the same command in Matthew 28:19-20. With Jonahï¿½s example before us, we have even less reason than Jonah for our disobedience.\n \nb. To flee to Tarshish: Why did Jonah choose Tarshish as his destination? Because this city was thought to be towards the end of the earth, and is always associated with ships in the Bible. Jonah wanted to go as far as he could to escape Godï¿½s presence, but this was a futile attempt.\n \ni. Nineveh was to the east of Israel and Tarshish was about as far as you could go west, on the coast of what is today Spain, past the straits of Gibraltar. In heading for Tarshish, Jonah intended to get as far away from Nineveh and the calling of God to go there as he possibly could.\n \nc. Found a ship going to Tarshish: We donï¿½t doubt that Jonah felt like going to Tarshish. There was in impulse within him driving him there, but it was a dangerous impulse. We may take Jonah as an example of the danger of doing things under impulse\n \ni. ï¿½Now, I very commonly meet with persons who say, ï¿½I felt that I must do so and so. It came upon me that I must do so and so.ï¿½ I am afraid of these impulses - very greatly afraid of them. People may do right under their power, but they will spoil what they do by doing it out of mere impulse, and not because the action was right in itself.ï¿½ (Spurgeon)\n \nï¿½        An impulse may be very brave, yet wrong (Jonah was very brave in embarking on such a long sea-journey)\nï¿½        An impulse may appear to be self-denying, yet wrong (it cost Jonah much in money and comfort to go on this long sea-journey)\nï¿½        An impulse may lay claim to freedom, yet be wrong (wasnï¿½t Jonah free to go to Tarshish?)\nï¿½        An impulse may lead someone to do something that they would condemn in others (what would Jonah say to another prophet disobeying God?)\nï¿½        An impulse can make us do to God or others what we would never want to be done to our self\n \nii. Many people take their inner impulses and say, ï¿½The Lord told me this or that.ï¿½ This is dangerous even when it doesnï¿½t seem so immediately. ï¿½What have you to do with the devices and desires of your own hearts? Are these to be a law to you? I pray you, be not among the foolish ones who will be carried about with every wind of fancy and perversity. ï¿½To the law and to the testimony,ï¿½ should be your cry, and you may not appeal to inward movements and impulses.ï¿½ (Spurgeon)\n \nd. So he paid the fare: It seemed easy enough. Perhaps even Jonah felt that the Lord provided the money for the fare! This shows the danger of being guided by circumstances.\n \ni. ï¿½Providence or no providence, the Word of the Lord is to be our guide, and we must not depart from it under pretext of necessity or circumstances. It is very easy to make up a providence when you want to do so. If you sit down and try to find in the ways of God to you an excuse for the wrong which you mean to commit, the crafty devil and your deceitful heart together will soon conjure up a plea for providence.ï¿½\n \nii. Nevertheless, when you run away from the Lord, you never get to where you are going and you always pay your own fare. When you go the Lordï¿½s way, you not only get to where you are going, but He pays the fare.\n \ne. From the presence of the Lord: Jonah should have read Psalm 139:7-10: Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? If I ascend into heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there Your hand shall lead me, and Your right hand shall hold me. You canï¿½t escape the presence of God.\n \ni. ï¿½All the while the ship sailed smoothly over the sea, Jonah forgot his God. You could not have distinguished him from the veriest heathen on board. He was just as bad as they were.ï¿½ (Spurgeon)\n \nB. God prevents Jonahï¿½s escape.\n \n1. (4) God sends a storm.\n \nBut the Lord sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was about to be broken up.\n \na. The Lord sent out a great wind: Remember that the Lord stirred up the storm. We often think of Jesus calming the waters, and He can do that. But He can also stir up the storm.\n \nb. So that the ship was about to be broken up: The ship and the sailors were in a dangerous place. This was all due to Jonah being on the ship. There was nothing wrong with the sailors being on the ship, but Jonah had no business there - though on other circumstances it might have been fine for him to go to Tarshish.\n \ni. Jonah might have wondered: ï¿½I can go to Tarshish if I want to. I paid the fare. Iï¿½m not a stowaway.ï¿½ Yet, ï¿½Apologies for disobedience are mere refuges of lies. If you do a wrong thing in the rightest way in which it can be done, it does not make it right. If you go contrary to the Lordï¿½s will, even though you do it in the most decent, and, perhaps, in the most devout manner, it is, nevertheless, sinful, and it will bring you under condemnation.ï¿½ (Spurgeon)\n \n2. (5-6) The sailors of the ship seek their superstitious gods.\n \nThen the mariners were afraid; and every man cried out to his god, and threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea, to lighten the load. But Jonah had gone down into the lowest parts of the ship, had lain down, and was fast asleep. So the captain came to him, and said to him, ï¿½What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your God; perhaps your God will consider us, so that we may not perish.ï¿½\n \na. Every man cried out to his god: When in trouble, man does his best to fix the problem. In this case, they threw the cargo overboard. When that isnï¿½t enough, man also instinctively turns to his god. If we donï¿½t know the true God - the God of the Bible - before we are in trouble, we may sincerely turn to a false and imaginary god, one of our own making.\n \ni. Many people assume that they can put off doing their business with God until they choose a ï¿½betterï¿½ time to do it. Nevertheless, it is extremely presumptuous to think that in the moment of crisis we will be able to call upon the true God if we have not dealt with Him before.\n \nb. Was fast asleep: How could Jonah sleep in the middle of this storm? Perhaps because the storm outside seemed insignificant to him in comparison to the storm inside, the storm that came from his resistance against God.\n \ni. What a curious and tragic scene! All the sailors were religious men, devout in their prayers to their gods. Yet their gods were really nothing, and could do nothing. There was one man on board who had a relationship with the true God, knew His Word, and worshipped Him - yet he was asleep!\n \nii. ï¿½Jonah was asleep amid all that confusion and noise; and, O Christian man, for you to be indifferent to all that is going on in such a world as this, for you to be negligent of Godï¿½s work in such a time as this is just as strange. The devil alone is making noise enough to wake all the Jonahs if they only want to awake . . . All around us there is tumult and storm, yet some professing Christians are able, like Jonah, to go to sleep in the sides of the ship.ï¿½ (Spurgeon)\n \niii. The nature of Jonahï¿½s sleep is also instructive, and too much like the sleep of the careless Christian:\n \nï¿½        Jonah slept in a place where he hoped no one would see him or disturb him. ï¿½Sleeping Christiansï¿½ like to ï¿½hide outï¿½ among the church\nï¿½        Jonah slept in a place where he could not help with the work that needed to be done. ï¿½Sleeping Christiansï¿½ stay away from the work of the Lord\nï¿½        Jonah slept while there was a prayer meeting up on the deck. ï¿½Sleeping Christiansï¿½ donï¿½t like prayer meetings!\nï¿½        Jonah slept and had no idea of the problems around him. ï¿½Sleeping Christiansï¿½ donï¿½t know what is really going on\nï¿½        Jonah slept when he was in great danger. ï¿½Sleeping Christiansï¿½ are in danger, but donï¿½t know it\nï¿½        Jonah slept while the heathen needed him. ï¿½Sleeping Christiansï¿½ snooze on while the world needs their message and testimony\n \niv. Some sleeping Christians protest that they are not asleep at all.\n \nï¿½        ï¿½We talk about Jesusï¿½ - but you can talk in your sleep\nï¿½        ï¿½We have a walk for Jesusï¿½ - but you can walk in your sleep\nï¿½        ï¿½We have passion for Jesus - I just wept in worship the other dayï¿½ - but you can cry in your sleep\nï¿½        ï¿½We have joy and rejoice in Jesusï¿½ - but you can laugh in your sleep\nï¿½        ï¿½We think about Jesus all the timeï¿½ - but you can think while you are asleep; we call it dreaming\n \nv. How can you know that you are not asleep? ï¿½ï¿½Then, what do you mean by a manï¿½s being really awake?ï¿½ I mean two or three things. I mean, first, his having a thorough consciousness of the reality of spiritual things. When I speak of a wakeful man, I mean one who does not take the soul to be a fancy, nor heaven to be a fiction, nor hell to be a tale, but who acts among the sons of men as though these were the only substances, and all other things the shadows. I want men of stern resolution, for no Christian is awake unless he steadfastly determines to serve his God, come fair, come foul.ï¿½ (Spurgeon)\n \nc. What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your God: The captain knew that his crew cried to their gods, but it did nothing. Perhaps Jonahï¿½s God could do something in the crisis.\n \ni. It must have seemed ironic to Jonah that the sailors demanded that he call on his God. His only reason for being on that ship was to escape his God.\n \n3. (7-8) The sailors discover that Jonah is the source of the trouble.\n \nAnd they said to one another, ï¿½Come, let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this trouble has come upon us.ï¿½ So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. Then they said to him, ï¿½Please tell us! For whose cause is this trouble upon us? What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?ï¿½\n \na. That we may know for whose cause this trouble has come upon us: It is hard to know what motivated the sailors to think that the storm was sent because one of them had wronged their God. Perhaps it was because of some spiritual insight, and they sensed a spiritual power in the storm. Or, perhaps it was just fortunate superstition.\n \nb. The lot fell on Jonah: Once the lot fell on Jonah, the sailors wanted to know as much as they could from Jonah, so they could discover a remedy and save their lives.\n \nc. What is your occupation: 2 Kings 14:25 says that Jonah was a recognized prophet. When he was asked, ï¿½What is your occupation?ï¿½ and he answered, ï¿½prophetï¿½ then the sailors must have been even more terrified.\n \n4. (9-10) Jonah tells them about who he is and what he has done.\n \nSo he said to them, ï¿½I am a Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.ï¿½ Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, ï¿½Why have you done this?ï¿½ For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them.\n \na. The God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land: Jonah knew the truth about God, even though his claim to fear the Lord was only partially true because he was running from the Lord.\n \ni. Even a believer who is in a state of rebellion can give glory to God if he will only tell the truth about God. Although, it is tragic that Jonahï¿½s life contradicted his knowledge of God.\n \nii. However, at the moment when Jonah said, ï¿½I fear the Lord,ï¿½ he may have already repented of running away, turning back to God because of the present circumstances.\n \nc. Why have you done this? Even an unbeliever who knows some truth about God can rightly rebuke a Christian who is resisting God. ï¿½Why have you done this?ï¿½ is the most logical question in the world, even for an unbeliever to ask a believer.\n \n5. (11-16) Jonah, at his own request, asks to be thrown into the sea, and the sailors reluctantly agree.\n \nThen they said to him, ï¿½What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us?ï¿½; for the sea was growing more tempestuous. And he said to them, ï¿½Pick me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will become calm for you. For I know that this great tempest is because of me.ï¿½ Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to land, but they could not, for the sea continued to grow more tempestuous against them. Therefore they cried out to the Lord and said, ï¿½We pray, O Lord, please do not let us perish for this manï¿½s life, and do not charge us with innocent blood; for You, O Lord, have done as it pleased You.ï¿½ So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the Lord and took vows.\n \na. What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us? The more the sailors hear, the worse the situation gets - the sea was growing more tempestuous.\n \nb. Pick me up and throw me into the sea: Why did Jonah ask to be thrown into the sea?\n \nï¿½        Perhaps out of compassion for the sailors\nï¿½        Perhaps out of a desire to be forced into complete dependence upon God alone. After all, There is no safer place than casting yourself totally upon God\nï¿½        Perhaps out of a feeling that anything was better than his continual resistance against and running from God\nï¿½        Perhaps because he had already truly repented. If this is the case, it illustrates that repentance is not only a matter of heart and mind, but also a matter of action\n \nc. Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to land: The sailors did not want to throw Jonah into the sea, because they believed his God was for real and they dreaded the consequences of throwing a prophet, even a disobedient prophet into the sea. Still, when all hope seemed to be lost they took precautions (ï¿½We pray, O Lord, please do not let us perish for this manï¿½s life, and do not charge us with innocent bloodï¿½) and threw Jonah into the sea.\n \nd. The sea ceased from its raging: The immediate end of the storm proved that Jonahï¿½s God was for real, and that Jonahï¿½s resistance to that God was the real problem. In a logical response the sailors feared the Lord exceedingly, sacrificed to God and made promises to serve Him.\n \ni. The sailors moved from fearing the storm to fearing the Lord, just the disciples in the boat did when Jesus calmed the storm (Mark 4:35-41).\n \nii. ï¿½Brethren, I wish I had meet words with which I could fitly describe the peace which comes to a human heart when we learn to see Jesus cast into the sea of divine wrath on our account. Conscience accuses no longer. Judgment now decides for the sinner instead of against him. Memory can look back upon past sins, with sorrow for the sin it is true, but yet with no dread of any penalty to come. It is a blessed thing for a man to know that he cannot be punished, that heaven and earth may shake, but he cannot be punished for his sin.ï¿½ (Spurgeon)\n \ne. And took vows: Notice that the vows of the sailors came after they were delivered. Based on this, many commentators believe that the sailors came to a true faith in God.\n \ni. Spurgeon preached a sermon with four wonderful points based on the actions of the crew in this chapter.\n \nï¿½        Sinners, when they are tossed upon the sea of conviction, make desperate efforts to save themselves\nï¿½        The fleshly efforts of awakened sinners must inevitably fail\nï¿½        The soulï¿½s sorrow will continue to increase as long as it relies on its own efforts\nï¿½        The way of safety for sinners is to be found in the sacrifice of another on their behalf\n \nï¿½ 2001 David Guzik - No distribution beyond personal use without permission",
                "The Book of Jonah\nThe Book of Jonah\nJonah Runs Away From God\nï¿½ Jonah One ï¿½ \nAmong the books of the \"Minor    prophets\" Jonah is likely the best known. This book allows us to observe    the many human emotions of a man that wants to do right but struggles    with his own selfish desires. At first Jonah is pictured as a man    resisting the will of God. He did not like what God told him to do. It    did not make sense to him that God was concerned about a wicked, Gentile    city. He ran away from his duty to God and his rebellion brought tragedy    to his life.\nThe work that God intended for    Jonah was simple. God told him, \"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city,    and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.\" The sins    on Nineveh had brought them almost to the point of destruction. Their    only hope for avoiding God's wrath was true repentance.\nJonah resisted doing as he was    told by God. He ran from God only to be swallowed by a \"great fish.\" Jonah tried to run away from his responsibilities to God and to man and    look at how things turned out for him. He spent three days and three    nights in the belly of this fish. This was used as a \"type\" of what    would later happen to Jesus. (Matthew 12:40) After being released by    being vomited out on dry land Jonah did as he was told in the beginning.    He preached, the people repented and God extended His mercy.\nArise; go preach to Nineveh --    Jonah 1:1-3:\nGod is concerned even    with the wickedness of heathen nations. So He commanded Jonah to preach    in Nineveh. Jonah, the son of Amittai, was a prophet of God from    Gathhepher. (2 Kings 14:25) Nineveh was the capital of Assyria. It was    located a little more than two hundred miles from the present city of    Baghdad. The book of Jonah is not a book of prophecy just because it    contains many predictions. In fact there is only one predictive element    in the book and it was very short term. \"And Jonah began to enter into    the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and    Nineveh shall be overthrown.\" (Jonah 3:4)\nInspiration is the key because    the Bible says, \"The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai.\" God    sent Jonah to cry out against Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian    Empire. He rebelled against God's plan and went in the opposite    direction toward Tarshish. Jonah soon learned what he should have    already known and that is that one cannot run away from God! (Psalm    139:7-11) Notice that Jonah paid the fare and went down into the ship.    When you run from God you pay your own fare and you always go down.\nWhy hast thou done this --    Jonah 1:4-10:\nGod sent a very    violent wind that was about to destroy the boat that Jonah was in. Jonah    learned \"the hard way\" that it is a terrible mistake to run from God.    The mariners were experienced men of the sea, yet they were afraid. They    were idol worshippers. Each prayed to his god for help. They lightened    the ship by throwing things overboard. Throughout this time Jonah was in    the inner part of the ship asleep. There was such a strain on him on the    inside that he was unaware of the storm raging outside. The shipmaster    awakened Jonah and told him to call upon his God for help. Oh but it    would do no good for Jonah to pray at this time because he is not    penitent.\nThe mariners said to one    another, \"Come, let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account this    evil has come upon us. So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.\" When the lot fell upon Jonah the shipmaster began to ask him some    questions. \"Tell us, we pray you, on whose account has this evil come    upon us? What is your occupation? Where did you come from? And what is    your country and nationality?\" Jonah told them that he was a Hebrew and    that he worshipped the God that had made the very sea that they were    upon and He made the dry land. The men could not believe that Jonah fled    from being in the presence of the God that he said he followed as a    prophet and as a servant.\nOur sin hurts others    -- Jonah 1:11-14:\nJonah's    sins had caused trouble for several other people. They were hurting    because of his wrong. Their situation was bad and the sea was becoming    more violent. They asked Jonah what to do to calm the sea. He said to    them, \"Take me up and cast me into the sea; so shall the sea become calm    for you, for I know that it is because of me that this great tempest has    come upon you.\" This action of casting Jonah into the sea would be used    to establish two truths. First, it would be shown, sure and certain,    that Jonah had caused this problem. Second this event would be used as a    type of Jesus spending three days and three nights in the heart of the    earth. (Matthew 12: 38-40)\nThe instruction to    cast Jonah into the sea had to come by inspiration from God. Jonah would    never have said something like that without divine inspiration. The    mariners were humane men so they rowed hard to bring the ship to the    land, but they could not. The sea just became more and more violent    against them. If they had known the nature of God they would have known    that it would have done no good to try to save Jonah when God said caste    him overboard into the sea. All these men knew about the true God they    had just learned from Jonah. Now they are praying to God that by casting    Jonah overboard they will be innocent because they are simply following    His instructions.\nGod prepared a great    fish -- Jonah 1:15-17:\nThese mariners were more obedient than God's prophet. \"They took up    Jonah and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging.\" They were sincerely sorry for having done what they believed would cause    the death of Jonah. After Jonah had been cast into the sea and the sea    stopped its ragging the mariners feared the Lord exceedingly. They    offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows. We do not have any    information if these men ever learned what happened to Jonah. We only    know that they threw him overboard into the sea and he disappeared or    they might have seen the fish swallow him.\nThe Bible tells us    that \"the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah    was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.\" The God that    made fish in the beginning could easily prepare a fish to swallow up His    unfaithful prophet. He could also easily preserve Jonah for these three    days and nights in the belly of this fish. The Lord that made and sent    the wind to cause the storm likewise made and sent the fish. Please    observe that the New Testament says, \"For as Jonas was three days and    three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days    and three nights in the heart of the earth.\" (Matthew 12:40)\nBeing a Christian is a    serious responsibility. Christianity involves your salvation. Your    Christianity may affect hundreds of others. To become a Christian, you    must hear the gospel (Romans 10:17), you must believe in Jesus (Mark    16:16), repent of every sin (Acts 2:38), confess Christ as Lord (Romans    10:9-10) and be baptized to be saved (1 Peter 3:21). After baptism the    challenge for every Christian is to serve God faithfully.\nJonah Running Back To God\nï¿½\nJonah Two ï¿½ \n \n          Jonah found out that   running away from God gets a person into serious trouble. Running from God   brought him into a storm and into the belly of great fish. Sin brings   terrible consequences. Solomon wrote, \"Good understanding giveth favour: but   the way of transgressors is hard.\" (Proverbs 13:15) it will always be true   that the way of the \"transgressor is hard.\" Certainly we know that not all   trouble comes because we have done wrong. A good example of that would be   Job. He had many troubles that were not caused by his own wrong doing. The   prodigal son, like Jonah, is a good example of how that running from god   brings certain misery.\n \n          Jonah ran back to   God as he prayed to him out of the fish's belly. Troubles my actually be a   blessing if they bring us back to God. Out of his afflictions Jonah cried   and the Lord hear him. The psalmist wrote, \"In my distress I cried unto the   Lord, and he heard me.\" (Psalm 120:1) Although he was very undeserving, God   saved Jonah, and He can save us too. God saved Jonah from physical hard and   He also saved him from the mess he had made in his spiritual life.\n \n          Jonah's sad   situation in life -- Jonah 2:1-3: Running from God caused Jonah to   find himself in a horrible state. He was in the fish's belly. Imagine the   horrors that you would feel being in the guts of a tremendously large fish.   This fish took Jonah into the heart of the sea. He felt that he was in Sheol   or the abyss. In the fishes belly the currents and waves passed over him.   The words of Jonah 2:1 remind us of what a mighty God we serve. He had the   power to prepare a great fish to swallow Jonah and then He had the power to   preserve Him in the fish's belly. \"Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God   from the fish's belly.\" No right thing is impossible for our mighty God.   Concerning a camel going through the eye of a needle Jesus said, \"With men   this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.\" (Matthew 19:26)   By His great power the Lord took care of Jonah while he was cut off from   normal life for that time.\n \n          Jonah sought   the Lord and prayed unto Him. He cried in his distress to God. He called   upon Him for help. Jonah had to know that he was being preserved miraculously by   the hand of God. However, this did not lesson the terribleness of his   situation. Now he must deal with this experience plus the emotions of   running from God. Jonah cried from hell or Sheol. He was using the word in   the sense of being subterranean. He   cried out of his distress to the Lord, and the   heard him. Jonah's concept about what   was happening was good. He did not say the mariners cast him into the sea.   He said to God, \"For You cast me into the deep,   into the heart of the seas, and the floods surrounded me; all Your waves and   Your billows passed over me.\" He knew   that what was happening was happening by the authority of God.\n \n          Looking toward God's holy temple -- Jonah 2:4-6: Jonah realized that he had left God's holy presence.  He promised that he   would look again toward God's holy temple and remember Him. Jonah said that   God cast him out of His sight. He was only out of his sight from Jonah's   point of view, not God's. \"Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither   shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:   if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the   morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; Even there shall thy   hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Surely the   darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. Yea, the   darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the   darkness and the light are both alike to thee.\" (Psalm 139:7-12)\n \n      Jonah felt   banished from before the eyes of God. He said, \"The waters compassed me   about, even to the extinction of life; the abyss surrounded me, the seaweed   was wrapped about my head.\" (Jonah 2:5) Jonah felt that his entire being was overwhelmed by the water. Jonah was in misery because he was outside of his   element. When a Christian is outside of his element he can likewise expect   torment. Jonah described his feelings saying, \"I went down to the bottoms of   the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou   brought up my life from corruption, O Lord my God.\" (Jonah 2:6) Jonah felt   shut off from God and from the entire world.\n \n          Jonah   remembered the Lord -- Jonah 2:7-9: Jonah's declaration was simple, \"When my life was slipping away, I   remembered you -- and in your holy temple you heard my prayer. All who   worship worthless idols turn from the God who offers them mercy. But with   shouts of praise, I will offer a sacrifice to you, my Lord. I will keep my   promise, because you are the one   with power to save.\" Jonah realized that   they only one to whom he could look for help was the Lord. He prayed unto the Lord his God out of the   fish's belly.\n \n      Jonah not only   prayed to God but he also gave other great Bible principles. He spoke of lying vanities or of the devotion   to idols. Idolatry is strictly condemned by the Bible. Those that trust in   idols are working against their own best interest.  Jonah also promised to sacrifice to God and to keep   the vows he had made to Him. This is an   indication of a person that has repented of wrongs. Jonah knew that only his   devotion to God could deliver him from his hopeless situation. Salvation is   of the Lord. This was true of Jonah's physical salvation and his spiritual   salvation too. His life was a mess physical and spiritually and only God   could help.\n \n      A fish listened to   God -- Jonah 2:10: What a sad lesson it is to realize that a fished   listened to God while Jonah, His prophet, and many of us do not listen at   all. The deliverance of Jonah was described simply in the expression, \"The   Lord commanded the fish to vomit up Jonah on the shore. And it did.\" (Jonah   2:10) Our powerful God could easily control the fish to do His will.\n \n          The fish \"vomited up Jonah on the shore.\" The   fish could easily float out to the shore of the sea and vomit Jonah out of   its mouth on to a place where the ground was not covered with water. The rebellious prophet even brought trouble and sickness to the fish. The   fact that the fish spat Jonah out at on this time frame was later used as an   example of Jesus' time in the grave. (Matthew 12:40)\n \n          To become a   Christian you must hear the gospel (Romans 10:17), believe in Jesus (John   8:24), repent of sins (Acts 2:38), confess Jesus as Lord and Christ (Acts   8:37), and be baptized to be saved. (Mark 16:16) As a Christian, let us   never run away from God; always wise enough to be faithful in doing the will   of God.\nJonah Running With God\nJonah Three ï¿½ \n \n            Have you ever messed up really bad? What would you do if given a second   chance to deal with the same opportunity? Jonah was given a second chance to   go preach to Nineveh. Each day that we live provides us with another \"second\" opportunity to get right with God or to render greater service in   His kingdom. It took him a while to get to Nineveh but when Jonah finally   surrendered to God he was able to do a great service for Him.\n \n            Nineveh was a very large city. ï¿½So Jonah arose, and went unto   Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding   great city of three days' journey.\" (Jonah 3:3) It took three days to walk,   either from one side to the other or around the city. \"In that city of   Nineveh there are more than a hundred twenty thousand people who cannot tell   right from wrong, and many cattle are also there.\" (Jonah 4:11)  Jonah   preached a message of doom that had been brought on by the sins of the   people. He warned the people, \"Forty days from now, Nineveh will be   destroyed!\" The response to the preaching of Jonah was great. The people   repented, from king to beggar. \"And the people of Nineveh believed God. They   called for a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the   least of them.\" God saw their repentance and changed His mind about the   destruction.\n            God sent His prophet with a clear, concise message and those   people repented. People have always been admonished to hear the word of the   Lord.  \"Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath   a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth,   nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.\" (Hosea 4:1) Today God has sent   His Son and all the people of the world should repent. \"Herein is love, not   that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the   propitiation for our sins.\" (1 John 4:10)\n            Jonah goes to Nineveh to preach -- Jonah 3:1-3: How relieved Jonah must have been to have been restored to   dry land. After three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, \"the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.\" (Jonah 2:10) Again the Lord renewed His instructions to Jonah. \"Once again   the LORD told Jonah to go to that great city of Nineveh and preach his   message of doom.\" (Jonah 3:1-2)  Jonah had learned his lesson. When the word   of the Lord came to him a second time telling him to arise and go to Nineveh   he went. People should always be eager and open to doing the will of God   quickly.\n            Jonah had repented and so in God's mind the past was forgotten.   With God it was just as if nothing had happened between Jonah and Himself.   In Jonah three we learn exactly what God's message for Nineveh involved. God   said that Jonah was to \"go   unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid   thee.\" At first Jonah ran away from God.   This time, \"Jonah arose and went to Nineveh,   according to the word of the LORD.\" He went in the direction of his duty   instead of away from his responsibility to God. \"Nineveh was an exceedingly   great city, three daysï¿½ journey in breadth.\" You can just imagine the depth of compassion   with which Jonah preached as he walked for three days across this city.\n \n            The people of Nineveh repented-- Jonah 3:4-5: Jonah went a dayï¿½s journey into the city of Nineveh and then began his   preaching. It sounds as if he reached the thickly populated part of town and then started his work. He warned the people, \"Forty days   from now, Nineveh will be destroyed!\" This was what the Lord had   commissioned him to preach. He is now a faithful prophet. Nothing is said   about the particular sin that had brought Nineveh to this sad state.   However, the people understood about God and what they needed to repent of.\n \n            Fasting is often connected with great blessings from God. In   Ezra 8:23 we observe the power of fasting in that day. \"So we fasted and   sought our God concerning this matter, and He listened to our entreaty.\" In   Nineveh \"They called for a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of   them to the least of them.\" They did this in the hope that God would spare   their nation even though that thought was not included in Jonah's preaching. Fasting and wearing sackcloth was a   custom in ancient times to show grief or repentance. These people did this   because \"they believed God.\"\n \n         The people of Nineveh repented -- Jonah 3:6-8: Just Jonah saying those words, \"Yet   forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown\" would likely not have brought   about this change among the people. There must have been something done or   actions to make the people understand what this was all about. The king of Nineveh set the example for the   people to repent. \"When the king of Nineveh   heard what was happening, he also dressed in sackcloth; he left the royal   palace and sat in dust.\" Leaders must always take the lead by setting the   example. Leadership demands doing the things that you expect of others.\n \n         Fasting and praying helped saved the people of Nineveh from God's   wrath. The king proclaimed a fast among all the people. The decree was that \"none of you or your animals may eat or drink a thing. Each of you must wear   sackcloth, and you must even put sackcloth on your animals.\" Without food   the beast of burdens would be unable to work and so this would mean a   further sacrifice to their owners. From king to beggar the people were to   turn from their evil ways and from the violence of their hands. They were to   repent of their sinful ways.\n \n            God repented   or changed His mind -- Jonah 3:9-10: The message was,    \"You must also pray to the Lord God with all your heart   and stop being sinful and cruel. Maybe God will change his mind and have   mercy on us, so we won't be destroyed.\" God does not want people to die lost   and hopeless. He is gracious and compassionate and desires that sinners   repent. The text says, ï¿½When God saw what they did, how they turned from   their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to   them, and he did not do it.\" He was pleased with their repentance and had   mercy on them. This was the hope of the King of Nineveh when he called upon   the people to repent.\n \n            Through His mercy God wanted to spare the children of Nineveh. \"And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more   than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and   also much cattle?ï¿½ God was willing to save this city in order to save the   young children of Nineveh. He even had pity on the cattle of Nineveh. We   serve a God that cares.\n \n                            Are you running with God? Are you in Christ?   Have you heard the gospel (Romans 10:17); believed in Christ (John 8:24);   repented of sins (Acts 17:30-31); confessed your faith in Christ (Matthew   10:32-33) and been baptized into Christ for remission of sins? (Acts 2:38,   Acts 22:16.) Those that run with Christ are the people that faithfully obey   Him. Are you faithful in Christ?\nJonah Runs Ahead of God\nï¿½ Jonah Four ï¿½ \n \n          Jonah   chapter four provides us with a picture of a man running far ahead of God.   Jonah, God's pouting prophet wanted the people of Nineveh destroyed. He   thought that He knew better than God did as to what their destiny should be.   He was displeased with God and with God's will. If we are not careful we may   find ourselves in the same spiritual condition as Jonah.\n \n          It is true that the   Ninevites were both a cruel and wicked nation. Jonah wanted them destroyed   because they were basically hated and despised by the Jews. His wish was   that they would just be wiped away. But, \"The Lord is not slack concerning   his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward,   not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\" (2 Peter 3:9) God loves all people and He wants everyone to be saved. (John   3:16) He could not understand Jonah's wicked attitude. Jonah was more   concerned about a gourd vine than about the people of Nineveh. God said, \"should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore   thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left   hand; and also much cattle?\" (Jonah 4:11) Let us never be like Jonah. We   must show mercy on the lost and prayerfully provide them an opportunity to   be saved. \n \n          Jonah's   angry prayer to God -- Jonah 4:1-3: The Lord's compassion toward   Nineveh displeased Jonah greatly. He was really upset and angry with God   because Nineveh had not been destroyed. A person can be angry and yet not   sin. \"Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\" (Ephesians 4:26) It was not the case with Jonah that he was angry and did   not sin. He allowed his feelings of anger to cause him to tragically despise   God's mercy. It may have been that both his prejudice and all that he had   been through because of the Ninevites had caused him to want them punished.\n \n       Jonah \"prayed to   the Lord and said, I pray You, O Lord, is not this just what I said when I   was still in my country? That is why I fled to Tarshish, for I knew that You   are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness, and   when sinners turn to You and meet Your conditions You revoke the sentence of   evil against them.\" (Jonah 4:2) Jonah wanted Nineveh punished severely, but   he recognized that God was full of mercy. Jonah was not at all a man that   would consider suicide but he was in such misery that he asked God to take   his life. (Jonah 4:3) When a man in his   right mind takes his own life it is murder just as if he had deliberately   killed another person. Jonah felt disgraced and he was looking for a way   out. A man is not a fit prophet or preacher if   he cannot accept God's justice, mercy and truth.\n \n          What   right do you have to be angry?   -- Jonah 4:4-5: Jonah's anger was not justified. So the Lord asked, \"Do you think you have   reason to be angry?\" (Jonah 4:4) The question was not asked to provide   information to God, rather it was asked to provide instruction to Jonah. The   Lord wanted Jonah to understand that his prayer would be answered in a   negative way and that his feelings were unjustified. Anger is a destructive   attitude. Solomon said, \"It is   better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry   woman.\" (Proverbs 21:19) We are reminded in song, \"Brightest links in life   are broken by a single angry word.\" Anger opens the door for sinful   attitudes and sinful behavior. Prayer and love for others can help us remove   anger from our lives.\n \n       Jonah became a   pathetic, pouting prophet. \"So Jonah went out of the city and sat to the   east of the city, and he made a booth there for himself. He sat there under   it in the shade till he might see what would become of the city.\" (Jonah 4:5) It seems that Jonah went to Nineveh, delivered God's message and   then went out on the east side of the city and waited. He was determined to   stay until he could see what became of the city. When the forty days past he   became angry because instead of receiving destruction the people received   mercy. Sadly, God's pouting prophet was hoping for Nineveh's destruction   instead of their salvation.\n \n          Jonah's   gourd vine and a worm -- Jonah 4:6-8: God continued to love his pouting prophet so He \"prepared   a gourd and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his   head, to deliver him from his evil situation. So Jonah was exceedingly glad   to have the protection of the gourd.\" (Jonah 4:4) Jonah had built a little booth and now the gourd vine would   provide him with additional shade and insulation from weather, much like a   tent. Sadly, Jonah was very happy to have the vine but not happy about the repentance of the people or about the mercy of   God.\n \nGod used the gourd vine   to teach Jonah a visual, but very sobering lesson. \"God prepared a cutworm   when the morning dawned the next day, and it smote the gourd so that it   withered.\" (Jonah 4:7) The lesson began with the worm and the vine and   continued when \"God prepared a sultry east wind, and the sun beat upon the   head of Jonah so that he fainted and wished in himself to die and said, It   is better for me to die than to live.\" (Jonah 4:8)  God sent a quiet but intensely hot wave of air that was   terribly depressing to Jonah. Now Jonah wanted to die for a different reason   other than the fact that the people had repented and God had shown mercy.\n \nJonah's unconcern for the city -- Jonah 4:9-11: Jonah was concerned about the gourd vine but was unconcerned about the   people of the city. God said to Jonah, \"You pity the plant, for which you did not   labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and   perished in a night.\" Jonah was now faithful to God in his preaching but he still had his same old   angry heart. Jonah should have realized that though his gourd vine was gone his God was still there.   God's love and care makes up for all of our losses. \n \nJonah   should have been thankful to God for sparing the city of Nineveh. The gourd   was small and insignificant. The city Nineveh was a \"great city, in which there are   more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left,   and also much cattle?\" (Jonah 4:11) This number might have refereed to children but more likely it   refereed to the ignorance of the people as to what is right and wrong.\n \n          While Jonah wanted   Nineveh destroyed, but God wants all men to fear and reverence Him. To   become a Christian you must hear the gospel and believe (John 6:44-45),   repent of sins (Acts 2:38), confess Jesus as Lord (Romans 10:9-10), and be   baptized into Christ. (Romans 6:3-4) Fear or reverence for the Lord will   also keep you in faithful service to God. (Matthew 10:22) Solomon said, \"Let   us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His   commandments, For this is man's all. For God will bring every work into   judgment, Including every secret thing, Whether good or evil.\" (Ecclesiastes   12:13-14)",
                "The Mercy of God as Found in the Old Testament\nThe Mercy of God as Found in the Old Testament\nIntroduction\nJonah and God's Mercy\nMost Christians know Jonah as the reluctant prophet who was swallowed by   a whale in order for God to convince him to go to Nineveh. Atheists often   get caught up in the whale part of the story, not realizing that the story   reveals that the ancients believed that God was merciful, although, at time,   they often wished He hadn't been.\nRich Deem\nAccording to Richard Dawkins, Yahweh,  the God of the Bible, is \"jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak;  a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal,  genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic,  capriciously malevolent bully.\" 1 Absent from any  of Dawkins' description of God is His mercy. People tend to think of the God of  the Old Testament as cruel and unforgiving, whereas the God of the New Testament  is seen as the God of mercy, who sent Jesus to atone for the sins of the world.  The Old Testament prophets were always warning the people about the wrath of God  should they stray from the path of righteousness. However, what is usually  ignored by atheists is God's mercy for those who did repent of doing evil. Yes, God  judged many people groups, but not before warning them.\nJonah and God's mercy?\nFor those of you who only remember the whale part of Jonah's story, here is a  brief synopsis to get you a better background about Jonah. God called Jonah to  travel to the city of Nineveh to warn them about their impending judgment,  because of their wickedness. 2 Jonah had different ideas, and attempted to flee from God by paying for passage  on a foreign ship. 3 However, God was not amused and sent a violent storm. 4 The sailors were terrified  and eventually figured out that Jonah was the cause of their endangerment, which he eventually  admitted to them. 5 Jonah was thrown overboard and God directed a great fish (or whale - the Hebrew  is not that specific) to swallow Jonah and take him to the shore. 6 Once expelled from the whale, Jonah decided to do what God had originally  requested and travelled to Nineveh to preach repentance from their evil. 7\nA number of Christians assume Jonah was reluctant to go to Nineveh because    they were known for their cruelty, and he feared for his life. However, the account gives a different    reason why Jonah did not want to go. Jonah actually wanted God to    judge the city of Nineveh and kill all their inhabitants. He was disappointed    that the king and the people repented of their evil and were spared from God's    judgment. 8 In fact, Jonah was so angry with God    that he asked God to kill him. 9 After that    conversation,    Jonah left the city and sat outside of it hoping that God would still destroy    the city. 10 God caused a plant to grow overnight    to give Jonah shade during his watch, but then caused the death of the plant    the next day. Jonah was furious about the plant. 11 God pointed out that Jonah's    priorities were completely messed up, since he was more concerned about a    plant that gave him shade than the fate of 120,000 souls in Nineveh:\nThen the LORD said, \"You had compassion on the plant for   which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow, which came up   overnight and perished overnight. Should I not have compassion on Nineveh,   the great city in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know   the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals?\" (Jonah 4:10-11)\nSo, it was clear to Jonah that God was merciful and He would reconsider His  judgment of evil if the people repented. 12 Since  Jonah wanted no part in God's mercy, he tried to avoid following God's  instructions to warn the people.\nDid God warn others?\nAtheists would like you to believe that the God of the Old Testament    just randomly killed people for no good reason and without warning. It    turns out that atheists often don't present the entire stories about    God's judgment. For example, in the greatest story of judgment, God sent    a flood to kill all humanity except Noah and his family. However, Noah    preached to the people of the coming judgment during the 100 years he    was building the ark. 13 In another famous    example, God destroyed the cites of Sodom and Gomorrah, because of their    evil. In fact, all the men of Sodom (including both young and old)    attempted to rape the two angels who came to warn Lot of the impending    judgment. 14 Although warned, 15 the men attempted to harm Lot, but were prevented when the angels caused    them all to become blind. 16 In many lesser    known stories, God warned the people prior to executing judgment. Some    of these warnings were heeded 17 and others    not, 18 with the expected consequences.    God's own people were often recipients of God's judgment, when they    refused to heed His warnings. 19 Here is a    short list from the writings of the prophets:\nProphet\nTyre, and other cities\nJudgment\nIt is a    well known principle that God regularly warned people of impending    judgment and He personally indicated that He would relent if they    changed their ways. 12 So, the atheists'    idea that God killed people without warning is false.\nDoes God kill the innocent?\nDid God kill any innocent people along with the evil ones? In the two   most famous examples of God's judgment discussed above, the text clearly   says that all   the people God killed were evil. 20 When God was about  to destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham asked God if He would  destroy the cities if there were 50 righteous people in them. 21 God said no. Then Abraham asked the same question if there were 45 righteous  people. Every time he dropped the number and got the same answer. The  fact is that God would not have destroyed those cities if there were any righteous people in them. The few righteous who were in those cities He warned  ahead of time to get out. 22 In another example, Abimelech, king of Gerar,   took Abraham's wife because he lied saying that she was his sister. 23 However, God prevented Abimelech from sleeping with her and warned him in a   dream. Abimelech heeded God's warning and was spared from death. 23 Eliphaz the Temanite, in his discussions with Job, acknowledged that God did   not judge the innocent with the guilty, but that those who act sinfully will   incur God's judgment. 24 So, God does not  destroy the righteous along with the evil.\nConclusion\nIn numerous instances, atheists cite the Old Testament for examples of where  God killed \"innocent\" people. However, the texts show that the  innocent are not judged, but only the guilty. In addition, virtually always, the  guilty individuals were warned ahead of time about their sin. Jonah is often known as the reluctant  prophet, although the reason for his hesitation was not due to the cruelty of  Nineveh, but because he feared its people might repent and God might spare them. Jonah wanted God to kill all the people of Nineveh, but feared His mercy. So, Christians are  not the only people who often seem to want to see God judge people for their  evil, rather than praying for their reconciliation with God. Jonah reveals that  God was known for His mercy even in Old Testament times. Even though God is  merciful, His mercy extends only to those who heed His words of warning. There  is no toleration for evil in God's kingdom, so those who insist on testing God's  resolve toward sin will find themselves judged, and incarcerated in God's jail .\nRelated Pages\nDawkins, R. 2008.

Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three days' walk.   (Jonah 3:3)\nWhen God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked     way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared     He would bring upon them. And He did not do it. But it greatly     displeased Jonah and he became angry. He prayed to the LORD and     said, \"Please LORD, was not this what I said while I was still in my     own country? Therefore in order to forestall this I fled to Tarshish,     for I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to     anger and abundant in lovingkindness, and one who relents concerning     calamity.\" (Jonah 3:10-4:2)\n\"Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from     me, for death is better to me than life.\" (Jonah 4:3)\nJonah went out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made   himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to   the city. (Jonah 4:5)\nThen the LORD God provided a vine and made it grow up over Jonah     to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was     very happy about the vine. But at dawn the next day God provided a     worm, which chewed the vine so that it withered. When the sun rose,     God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah's     head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, \"It would be     better for me to die than to live.\" But God said to Jonah, \"Do you     have a right to be angry about the vine?\" \"I do,\" he said. \"I am     angry enough to die.\" (Jonah 4:6-9)\n\"If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted,   torn down and destroyed, and if that nation I warned repents of its evil,   then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned.

Don't do this wicked thing.\" (Genesis 19:6-7)\n\"Get out of our way,\" they replied. And they said, \"This fellow     came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll     treat you worse than them.\" They kept bringing pressure on Lot and     moved forward to break down the door. But the men inside reached out     and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then they     struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old,     with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis     19:9-11)\n\"Say to the assembly, 'Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and   Abiram.'\" Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of   Israel followed him.

Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be   swept away because of all their sins.\" (Numbers 16:24-26)\nWhen the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it,   he said, \"It is the man of God who defied the word of the LORD.

(2 Kings 17:20)\n\"You warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and   disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, by which a man   will live if he obeys them.

They called to Lot, \"Where   are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can   have sex with them.\" (Genesis 19:4-5)\nThen the men turned away from there and went toward   Sodom, while Abraham was still standing before the LORD. Abraham came near   and said, \"Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?   Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed sweep it   away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in   it? Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the   wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it   from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?\" So the LORD   said, \"If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare   the whole place on their account.\" And Abraham replied, \"Now behold, I have   ventured to speak to the Lord, although I am but dust and ashes. Suppose the   fifty righteous are lacking five, will You destroy the whole city because of   five?\" And He said, \"I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.\" He   spoke to Him yet again and said, \"Suppose forty are found there?\" And He   said, \"I will not do it on account of the forty.\" Then he said, \"Oh may the   Lord not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?\" And   He said, \"I will not do it if I find thirty there.\" And he said, \"Now   behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord; suppose twenty are found   there?\" And He said, \"I will not destroy it on account of the twenty.\" Then   he said, \"Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once;   suppose ten are found there?\" And He said, \"I will not destroy it on account   of the ten.\" As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD   departed, and Abraham returned to his place. (Genesis 18:22-33)\nWhen morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, \"Up,   take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept   away in the punishment of the city.\" But he hesitated. So the men seized his   hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, for the   compassion of the LORD was upon him; and they brought him out, and put him   outside the city. (Genesis 19:15-16)\nNow Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived  between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar, and there Abraham said  of his wife Sarah, \"She is my sister.\" Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for  Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to  him, \"You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a  married woman.\" Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said, \"Lord, will you  destroy an innocent nation? Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister,' and didn't  she also say, 'He is my brother'? I have done this with a clear conscience and  clean hands.\" Then God said to him in the dream, \"Yes, I know you did this with  a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why  I did not let you touch her. Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and  he will pray for you and you will live.

                "Jonah - Chapter 3\nJonah\nCopyright © 2000 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n \n \n3:1 Now the word of Yahweh     came to Jonah a second time saying:\n3:2 \"Get up1! Go2 to Nineveh, the great3 city, and cry out4 to it the message4 I give you.\"\n3:3 And Jonah got up1 and went2 to Nineveh according to the     word of Yahweh. Now Nineveh, a city important3 to God17, required three days to visit     it.\nBack to the Beginning\nThese versus parallel the first   couple of versus of chapter one. After Jonah had gone through   all that he had, he was confronted with the same instructions   as before, with one slight change. In the beginning God asked   Jonah to cry out \"against\" (aleyha) Nineveh.   Now Jonah was asked to cry out \"to\" (eleyha)   Nineveh. A subtle change. Aleyha means \"against\" with a downward intimation. Eleyha means \"towards.\" The significance of this slight change in wording is not clear.   Perhaps some change had occurred in Nineveh that warranted a   slightly different message than was appropriate before Jonah   set out on his escape.\nOnly Jonah Will Do\nGod was insistent upon using   Jonah for this mission. None other would do. When Queen Esther   resisted going to her husband, the Persian king, to intercede   for the Jews, her uncle Mordecai told her,\n\"For if you remain silent       at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews       from another place and you and your father's house will perish.       And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such       a time as this?\" (Esther 4:14).\nFurther, God's plans are not   even dependent upon human beings. When Jesus entered Jerusalem   and was hailed with Messianic references, He told his critics   that the stones themselves would announce Him if the people did   not (Luke 19:40). But when Jonah ran from his assignment God   did not just write him off and call another to take his place.   There were probably several other prophets God could have chosen   and prepared who would have willingly preached to Nineveh. God   could have prepared another prophet from before Creation just   as He had done with the fish. But God insisted on Jonah.\nWhy would God insist on Jonah   - one so out of sync with God's heart - for this mission? Perhaps   the reason lies in Jonah as a type for Israel. When the Apostle   Paul gave his defense before the people in Jerusalem everyone   listened to his testimony with interest until he said that the   Lord had told him, \"Go! For I will send you far away to   the Gentiles\" (Acts 22:21). With that statement the Jews   immediately reacted with disgust and called for Paul's death   (Acts 22:22). Jonah represents the Jews who were disgusted that   anyone would even suggest God would reach out to the Gentiles.   They would ask: \"doesn't God hate the Gentiles because of   their idolatry, immorality, and disregard for God's Law?\" But doesn't a similar attitude exist within the Church? Some   ask: \"doesn't God hate materialists, homosexuals, and atheists?\" But the Lord said, \"I take no pleasure in the death of the   wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live\" (Ezekiel 33:11). Jonah's mission to Ninveh was proof enough that   God's love extended to all. Otherwise He would have destroyed   them all without warning.\nNineveh - Important to God\nThroughout Jonah Nineveh has   been referred to as \"the great city.\" Now the formula   phrase is broken in 3:3 with Nineveh described as \"great   to God,\" a Hebrew idiom which means \"very important.\" The simple idiomatic understanding of the phrase makes 3:3 read: \"Nineveh, a very important city, required three days to   visit it.\" And on the surface level of the story this is   the intended meaning. But as we have seen, every word requires   examination in Jonah. The non-idiomatic meaning must also be   examined to see how it fits into the themes and underlying images   of the book. Nineveh was quite literally \"important to God.\" Proof consisted in the extensive measures the Lord employed to   deliver His message and messenger to them. In this phrase we   see how God viewed Nineveh. They really were very important to   Him. He loved them very much and wanted to avoid their destruction   if at all possible. By extension, Nineveh stands for all men,   and thus, all men are important to God.\n3:4 Jonah proceeded67 into the city the first day and cried out4 to them: \"In forty more days Nineveh will be overturned68.\"\nBare Minimum\nThough Nineveh required three   days to properly visit it Jonah preached for only one day. In   that one day he said only five (Hebrew) words to them [f] .   Jonah did not even preface his message with a \"thus says   Yahweh\" The Ninevites would not have known who Yahweh was   anyway. Nor did he endow his message with authority by proclaiming \"the God of the heavens, creator of the sea and the dry   ground says,\" which was the phrase he had used with the   pagan sailors. We cannot say for sure if Jonah gave a more elaborate   sermon to the men. Many commentators suggest that Jonah must   have preached a more extensive message or that his coming was   announced days or weeks before he arrived. But the sheer brevity   of the proclamation exemplifies something about Jonah's preaching   that the writer wanted to convey. It illustrates the bare minimum   effort that Jonah performed. Jonah did not have the disposition   to \"go the extra mile\" - at least not for the Gentile   Ninevites. Indeed, he did not go one iota beyond his obligation.   If any prior announcement of Jonah's arrival was given to Nineveh   it likely came from the sailors or those who heard the sailors'   story and not from Jonah himself. However, God took this meager   message and bare minimum effort and used it to awaken the Ninevite's   consciences. The threat of judgement alone was enough to do this.   Despite Jonah, salvation was all God's doing from beginning to   end.\nGod employs us in His work, though   He is not dependent upon our actions to save anyone. No one that   the Father has called to Himself since before Creation will be   lost. However, if we neglect the mandate to go out into the world   to preach the gospel then we are the losers. The wicked servant   in the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30) exemplifies   this principle. In that parable a master entrusted his wealth   to his servants and then left on a long journey. After the master   returned to collect on his investment from his servants, one   wicked servant told the master, \"I knew you to be a hard   man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered   no seed and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in   the ground. See, you have what is yours\" (Matt 25:24-25).   That servant had the impression that his master reaped where   He did not sow. He figured that God's work would be done no matter   what he did, so he thought he might as well shirk his duties.   But the master showed this servant that it did matter; the servant   was the loser in the deal. If we neglect the Lord's command,   the Lord's work still gets accomplished (see Isaiah 55:10-11),   but we lose out.\nOverturned in Forty Days\nThe term \"forty days\" evokes the image of the Flood of Noah. Although there are other   references to \"forty days\" in the Bible, the intended   image seems apparent as the Flood due to the undertone of imminent   judgement and destruction. This allusion is enhanced by the likening   of Nineveh's sin to the sin of the world before the Flood (see   the comments in Nineveh's Sin later in this chapter).   But aside from this allusion to the Flood why did God delay forty   days? Wouldn't it have been less hassle for God to just destroy   Nineveh outright and save Himself the trouble of sending a difficult   character like Jonah to them? A hope for repentance embeds itself   within the forty day time delay.\nBut more than that, a hope for   repentance is contained within the word \"overturned\" (haphak) itself. Haphak fundamentally means \"change.\" It can mean change for the worse, as in \"destroy\" or   it can mean to change for the better, as in \"transform.\" God announced, through Jonah, that things would change in Nineveh   - for better or worse. Other Hebrew words, such as shachath,   which strictly means to \"ruin\" or \"destroy,\" could have been chosen if the only intended meaning was \"destruction.\" But haphak contains a hope of repentance for Nineveh.   It is as the prophet Jeremiah wrote:\n7 \"At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning       a kingdom to uproot, to pull down, or to destroy it; 8 if       that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil,       I will relent concerning the calamity I planned to bring on it. 9 Or at another moment I might speak concerning       a nation or concerning a kingdom to build up or to plant it; 10 if it does evil in My sight by not obeying       My voice, then I will think better of the good with which I had       promised to bless it.\" (Jeremiah 18:7-10).\n3:5 Now the men15 of Nineveh trusted69 in God17 and cried out4 for everyone - from the most important3 to the least significant70 - to fast and wear sackcloth.\nNinevite Evangelists\nThe word \"trusted\" in 3:5 is the Hebrew word aman. It carries the image of   the trust one puts in a parent or someone who nurtures you. Aman is the same word used in describing the faith of Abraham: \"Then   he [Abraham] believed (aman) in the Lord; and He reckoned   it to him as righteousness\" (Genesis 15:6). This was the   kind of trust that these heathen men put into the One they only   knew as elohiym; it was the same trust that Abraham had.   Because elohiym can mean either \"gods\" or \"the   one true God,\" we must determine its correct meaning by   the context. Since Yahweh recognized their repentance we understand elohiym here to mean Yahweh, the one true God. Thus, the   men of Nineveh trusted in Yahweh, just as the pagan sailors had   done before them. And it was reckoned to them as righteousness.\nWhen Jonah came to Nineveh he   cried out (qara) to them. But the men of Ninveh commandeered   Jonah's job and cried out (qara) for everyone to repent. Qara can carry with it a sense of invitation. Coercion   was not a factor in their call to repentance. The repentant men   invited everyone to repent along with them. None were exempted   from the invitation. The rich were not exempted because of their   riches. The intelligent, the leaders, and the respected among   society were not exempted because of their status or special   skills. The poor, the unintelligent, the obscure, and the outcasts   were not exempted because of their disadvantages. All were invited   to join in the mass repentance.\nThe Source of Nineveh's Repentance\nHow was it that Nineveh repented   so quickly at such a meager message? As already suggested, perhaps   news of Jonah had already reached Nineveh. But any society ripe   for judgement from God must necessarily experience the symptoms   of their degeneracy. People certainly could look around at their   society and see that things were not right. Their response proved   that their consciences had not become seared beyond hope.\nPeople can learn from sin at   three different levels. In the first, and highest level, we can   learn by listening to advice and observing the mistakes of others.   That can be enough to convince some of correct actions. In the   second level, a person disregards advice and examples and decides   that that they can commit a wrong without repercussions. But   one close call convinces them to change their ways. In the third   level, a person ignores several close calls, and changes their   ways only after suffering from the consequences of their actions.   But then there are those that ignore advice, examples, close   calls, and the suffering of consequences and still refuse to   change their ways. Only God knows if such are beyond hope. Nineveh   had ignored the evil growing in them thus far, but had undoubtedly   reaped some of their bitter harvest one way or another. Fortunately   for them God knew that they were not beyond hope. They had had   enough of themselves and were ripe for repentance.\n3:6 When these words reached       the king of Nineveh he arose1 from his       throne, put away50 his robe of glory71, clothed72 himself with sackcloth, and       sat down in the ashes73.\n3:7 He called out for help16 and said that by decision74 of the king       and the members of the ruling class3 that in Nineveh: \"Each peson is not to taste74 or drink anything and that each beast, herd, or flock is not       to feed or be watered.\n3:8 \"Let each man15 and beast be clothed72 in sackcloth       and let them all vehemently75 cry       out4 to God17 and let all the men15 turn away34 from their evil5 ways76 and their violence77 that is in their hands78.\n3:9 \"Who knows27? God17 may turn away34 [from His intent] and relent79 and turn       away34 from His furious80 anger81 so that we will not perish25.\"\nThe King Rises\nWhen the words of the repentant   Ninevites reached (literally, \"touched\") the king he   changed his throne for ashes and his robe for sackcloth. He set   aside his symbols of pride, position, and accomplishments and   sat in worthlessness, for this is what the word epher (ashes) figuratively means. The ubiquitous images of rising and   descending once again appear here. But unlike Jonah's descent   of chastisement the king's descent was of repentance. In the   king's repentance he rose from his throne. And so the Lord raises   him up to Himself as James said, \"humble yourselves in the   presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you\" (James 4:10).   Before the world his repentance was demonstrated by his descent   into the ashes. And though he sat in ashes before the world yet   he sat with God, as Isaiah wrote, \"for thus says the high   and exalted One who lives forever, whose name is Holy, 'I dwell   on a high and holy place, and also with the contrite and lowly   of spirit in order to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive   the heart of the contrite'\" Isaiah 57:15).\nThe Decree\nA national crisis existed in   Nineveh. A fierce and terrifying storm of evil raged there. Surely   some, oblivious to their precarious situation, still slept in   unconcern as Jonah had earlier slept through the storm at sea.   When the king compelled all of Nineveh to join in calling out   for help he parallels the captain of the sailors who implored   Jonah to assist the sailors in their call for help. But the king   and the ruling class realized, just as the sailors did in their   storm, that the situation was beyond human control and they needed   to cry out for help. The same word that was used when the sailors   cried out for help in 1:5, zaag, is now used here for   the Ninevite rulers' call for help to the populace. Zaag means to call for aid or assistance. For those who still slept   in unconcern the king wanted to wake them so they too could assist   in averting the inevitable disaster. The Apostle Paul elicited   similar invitations: \"Awake, sleeper, and arise from the   dead, and Christ will shine on you\" (Ephesians 5:14) and \"so then let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert   and sober\" (I Thessalonians 5:6).\nThe leaders of Nineveh decided [g] that everyone should show their repentance by fasting and wearing   sackcloth. The fast that God acknowledges is not a mere abstinence   from food. Isaiah tells us that a fast should be a manifestation   of a work in the heart (Isaiah 58:5-8). Even the animals were   included in this demonstration of mass repentance. Because the Ninevites had many animal deities, the inclusion of animals in   their repentance showed that the Ninveites symbolically subjugated   their heathen gods before God. Moreover, all of the men and animals   were to vehemently (chozqah) call out to God. The strong   Hebrew verb chozqah denotes force and violence. Formerly,   an evil violence (chamac in 3:8) emanated from Nineveh   before God's face. Now a good violence (chozqah) rose   from Nineveh into God's presence.\nThe king completed the decree   with a hope that echoed the ship captain's in chapter one. The   ship captain said, \"Perhaps the gods will consider us and   not let us perish\" (1:6). And here the king said, \"Who   knows? God may turn away [from His intent] and relent and turn   away from His furious anger so that we will not perish\" (3:9). In the same way, the sailors foreshadow the men of Nineveh.   Therefore our hopes are raised that Nineveh will also be preserved,   just as the sailors were.\nNineveh's Sin\nNineveh's \"evil ways\" denotes a well-trodden path of wickedness that they traveled.   But as to their specific sin we only have the word \"violence\" (chamac). Chamac means \"violence,\" \"cruelty,\" \"robbing,\" and \"injustice.\" This same word   characterized the people of the earth just prior to the Flood   (see Genesis 6:11,13), giving yet another allusion to Noah's   Flood. Nineveh was guilty of the same sin that caused God to   destroy the whole world. The Assyrians, with its capital of Nineveh,   were notorious for their cruelty. They would gouge out eyes,   cut off limbs, and a myriad of other maimings to intimidate people.   They would choose a town and behead every man, woman, and child.   They would then heap all of the heads into a huge pile near a   well-traveled road in order to intimidate the surrounding regions.   Then, without interference, they would take what they wanted   from whom they wanted.\nThe world today is filled with chamac - violence, cruelty, robbing, and injustice. Who   or what has not been touched by it? Even the environment is a   victim of chamac. But it is not just the blatant physical   manifestations of chamac that God is concerned with. In   fact, God is primarily concerned with its manifestation in   the heart. We see this principle when Jesus said that, to God,   hate was equivalent to murder. Hate is the heart condition that   potentially leads to physical violence. The commandment to not   murder (Exodus 20:13) is already broken with hate without any   physical expression. In the same way, violence originates in   the heart and can sometimes manifest itself only in the imagination.   The call was for the Ninevites to turn away from \"their   violence that is in their hands (kaph).\" The word kaph here denotes that which was in their control. Some   with violent imaginations refrain from physical expression only   because they lack the power or opportunity to be physically effective.   Others specialize in emotional and psychological chamac.   But God detests chamac so much that He justifiably destroyed   the whole world in a great deluge.\n3:10 When God17 saw from their actions30 that they had turned away34 from their evil5 ways76 God17 relented79 and did not bring30 the devastation5 upon them that He had       spoken of.\nWhat God Saw\nWhen God saw from their actions   that they had turned away from their evil ways what did God see?   When Samuel looked at Jesse's sons to see which one the Lord   had chosen to be the king of Israel the Lord told Samuel that, \"God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward   appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.\" (I Samuel   16:7). The actions of the Ninevites reflected the real work that   had occurred in their hearts; and that is what God saw. The actions   they performed to show their repentance did not justify them   before God. This is what the Apostle Paul meant when he wrote, \"Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident;   for, 'The righteous man shall live by faith'\" (Galatians   3:11) and, \"For if a law had been given which was able to   impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based   on law.\" (Gal 3:21b). Neither Abraham nor the men of Nineveh   had the benefit of the Mosaic Law. But their trust (aman)   in God declared them all as righteousness before the Lord.\nHowever, if an authentic work   had occurred in the hearts of the men of Nineveh then good actions   would naturally be produced. It is as James said, \"I will   show you my faith by my works\" (James 2:18b). When Paul   stated that \"For by grace you have been saved through faith;   and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result   of works, so that no one may boast\" (Ephesians 2:8-9) he   immediately followed it with the statement, \"For we are   His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which   God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them\" (Ephesians   2:10).\nSacrifice for All Time\nIn chapter one the captain prefigured   the king of Nineveh and the sailors foreshadowed the actions   of the people of Nineveh. In the end they both turned (shuv)   to God. This has a significant implication. If the sailors attempted   to turn back to the dry land and could not prevail until they   had given Jonah as a sacrifice, then the people of Nineveh also   could not prevail to their \"dry ground\" of salvation   until they too gave a sacrifice. That is, Nineveh's repentance   could not be recognized without a sacrifice. But we see no sacrifice   of this sort occurring in Nineveh. For that matter, what kind   of sacrifice was Jonah anyway, for the Psalmist says, \"No   man can by any means redeem his brother or give to God a ransom   for him - for the redemption of his soul is costly\" (Psalm   49:7-8a). This brings us back to the sailors having tossed Jonah   into the sea as a type for Christ's sacrifice. Salvation came   to the sailors not because of Jonah, but because of Christ. Christ's   sacrifice affected all of time (see Hebrews 9:25-28). Thus, retroactively   the sailors and the people of Nineveh obtained salvation through   the sacrifice of Christ. And subsequently, Christ's blood allows   recognition of our repentance before God.\nGod's Sovereign Plans\nJust as God had a mission for   the fish He also had a mission for Jonah. Jonah thought he could   escape first by running and then by dying. The implication then   is that Nineveh also has an appointment - an appointment to repentance   and salvation. Hence, come hell or high water God's plans would   be accomplished. Not even a sour prophet could prevent God's   plans. The Lord said that His word, \"will not return to   Me empty, without accomplishing what I desire, and without succeeding   in the matter for which I sent it\" (Isaiah 55:11). And so   Nineveh received the salvation that God had ordained for them.\nFootnotes for   Chapter 3\n[f] The writer of Jonah seems   to drawing a quantitative contrast between the five words of   Jonah given to the pagan Ninevites and the five books of Moses   given to the Jews. This aspect is explored in the section Accountability   to God in the fourth chapter.\n[g] In 3:7 the Hebrew word taam appears twice and means both \"decision\" and \"taste.\" So 3:7 can amusingly be read as \"by taste of the king...each   man is not to taste.\"",
                "We’re Just Like Jonah | Keep Believing Ministries\nWe’re Just Like Jonah\nJonah 1\nListen to this sermon\nIs there a better story in the Bible than the story of Jonah? Generations of Sunday School children have listened with wide-eyed amazement at the story of the fish that caught a man. We love this story, yet for all our telling and re-telling, we barely understand what it means.\nWith this message we begin a five-part series on the book of Jonah called “Outrageous Grace.” In order to frame that theme properly, let’s start with the words of the French philosopher Pascal:\nTo make a man a saint, grace is absolutely necessary. And whoever doubts it does not know what a saint is or what a man is.\nSome years ago Philip Yancey wrote a mega-bestseller called What’s So Amazing About Grace? in which he called grace “the last great word.” He meant that it is one of the last of the “great words” that has retained some of its original meaning: “free and undeserved bounty.” For instance, when we pray, we “say grace” to thank God for our food. We are “grateful” for a kindness done by another person. To show our thanks we offer a “gratuity.” Something offered at no cost is said to be “gratis.” And when we have overdue books from the library, we may return them at no charge during a “grace period.”\nOur Churches and Our Children\nIt is commonly said that Christianity is supremely a religion of grace. And that is certainly true. We sing about grace, we write poems about grace, we name our churches and our children after grace. If you ask us, we certainly believe in grace, but outside of the worship services, the word is rarely on our lips.\nYancey points out that part of our problem is in the nature of grace itself. Grace is hard to accept, hard to believe, and hard to receive. We all have a certain skepticism when a telemarketer tells us, “I’m not trying to sell you anything. I just want to offer you a free trip to Hawaii.” Automatically we wonder, “What’s the catch?” because we have all been taught that “there’s no free lunch.\"\nGrace is hard to accept, hard to believe, and hard to receive.\nYancey goes on to say that grace shocks us in what it offers. It is truly not of this world. It frightens us with what it does for sinners. Grace teaches us that God does for others what we would never do for them. We would save the not-so-bad. God starts with prostitutes and then works downward from there. Grace is a gift that costs everything to the giver and nothing to the receiver. It is given to those who don’t deserve it, barely recognize it, and hardly appreciate it.\nAs I pondered this, a thought hit me in a very powerful way . . .\nGod is more gracious than I am.\nYou know how I know that? Because he saves people I wouldn’t save if I were God. He blesses people I wouldn’t bless if I were God. He uses people in his service I wouldn’t use if I were God.\nGod saves people I wouldn’t save if I were God.\nWhich is why I’m glad he’s God and I’m not. The Bible says that he is “the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,\" (Exodus 34:6) and that’s good news for sinners everywhere.\nThe World Worst Missionary\nThe doctrine of grace may be the hardest doctrine in the Bible to accept. It’s not that grace is hard to understand. We know what the word means. Our problem comes in the application. Grace asks us to accept two things we don’t want to accept:\n1. There is nothing we can do to save ourselves.\n2. If God doesn’t save us, we will never be saved.\nNothing more clearly summarizes the true meaning of grace than the simple phrase found Jonah 2:9, “Salvation is of the Lord.\"\nThat statement is both striking and humorous because it comes from the world’s worst missionary. As we begin our journey with Jonah, let’s clarify one point. Jonah is not the hero of the story. God is! At the beginning he is running from God; at the end he is arguing with God. In between he is praying and preaching. He’s no hero. He’s an anti-hero.\nThis book is about God. We can see it clearly this way:\nThe fish is mentioned 4 times.\nThe city is mentioned 9 times.\nJonah is mentioned 18 times.\nGod is mentioned 38 times.\nJonah is not the hero of the story. God is!\nThis book is about God and how great his heart is toward prodigal sons and daughters who run away from him. God never gives up on Jonah, not when he runs away and not when he sits under a vine and pouts.\nHere is the take-away lesson for all of us: We’re so much like Jonah that it’s scary. There’s a little Jonah in all of us and a whole lot of Jonah in most of us.\nThat’s why we need, not just grace, but outrageous grace.\nWith that as introduction, here are three quick notes about the book of Jonah:\n1. It’s a true story. \nContrary to the critics and skeptics, I believe this story is recorded as sober, historical truth.  That is, there really was a man named Jonah who really did flee to Tarshish, who really was swallowed whole by a great fish, who really did survive for three days in the fish’s belly, and who actually was vomited up on dry ground.  It’s all true, just the way it was written. It’s not a myth or a legend or a saga or a fable or a parable.  Jonah is a true story.  We can date the book at about 765 B.C. during the days of Jeroboam II, king of Israel.\nBy the way, Jonah came from  Gath-Hepher, a little town in the northern part of Israel, in the region the New Testament calls Galilee, not far from village of Nazareth where Jesus grew up. That means Jonah was a country boy, raised in a rural area who likely grew up in a poor family.\n2. It’s a short story.\nOnly four chapters, 48 verses, just over 1300 words. You can read it in 15 minutes. Yet it tells us all we need to know. Beautifully balanced, deep and profound, this book opens a window into the heart of God.\n3. It is a revealing story.\nI’m sure most of us have taken a ship to Tarshish at one time or another. We all know what it means to run the other way. And we know how creative the Lord can be when he wants to bring us back to where we ought to be.\nHere’s a simple outline to help us understand the flow of the story:\nChapter 1:  Jonah flees.\nChapter 3:  Jonah preaches.\nChapter 4:  Jonah pouts.\nIn chapter 1 Jonah is running from God; in chapter 2 he is praying to God; in chapter 3 he is speaking for God; in chapter 4 he is learning about God.\nJesus loved the story of Jonah.\nWe call this book one of the minor prophets, yet it contains only one prophecy. It’s really a book about Jonah and God. We know that our Lord loved this story because Jonah is the only minor prophet Jesus mentioned by name (Matthew 12:40).\nThe Call God Gave\nThe story begins this way:  “The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai: ’Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me\" (Jonah 1:1-2). Some of you may have a version of the Bible that says, “Arise, go to Nineveh.” That’s what the Hebrew literally says. The meaning is, “Jonah, get up and go to Nineveh now.”\nIt’s amazing, isn’t it, how just one sentence can change your life. You can be driving down the highway and get one phone call that changes your life forever. If it’s good news, your life changes one way. If it’s bad news, it changes in another way. Either way, your life can be turned upside down with just one phone call.\nLife can turn on a dime. That’s what happened to Jonah when God when God spoke three little words:\n“Go to Nineveh.\"\nLife can turn on a dime. \nNote what Jonah was to do. Go to Nineveh and “preach against it.” This is not “God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.” It’s not “your best life now.” This is Bad News from Almighty God.\nGo to Nineveh and preach against it! Their evil was like a dirty stench to the Lord. The time for judgment had come.\nWhen God said Nineveh was wicked, he wasn’t kidding. Nineveh was the capital of Assyria, the most powerful empire in the world in that day. The Assyrians had a reputation for cruelty that is hard for us to fathom.  Their specialty was brutality of a gross and disgusting kind. When their armies captured a city or a country, unspeakable atrocities would occur. Things like skinning people alive, decapitation, mutilation, ripping out the tongues, making a pyramid of human heads, piercing the chin with a rope and forcing prisoners to live in kennels like dogs. Ancient records from Assyria boast of this kind of cruelty as a badge of courage and power.\nThe Assyrians had no use for the Jews, and the Jews hated the Assyrians. Hated them for their bloodthirsty cruelty. Hated them for their idolatry. Hated them for their arrogance. For a Jewish man to be told by God to go preach to Nineveh was repugnant. As far as Jonah was concerned, Nineveh could go straight to hell. “Go ahead, Lord. Push the button. Open the trapdoor. Let ‘em fall straight down into the pit.” That’s how Jonah felt about Nineveh.\nWhat qualifies as Nineveh today?\nNineveh is whatever pulls you out of your comfort zone.\nNineveh is the place God calls where you don’t want to go.\nNineveh is the people who have hurt you deeply and God says, “Go and give them my message.”\nNineveh is the place God calls where you don’t want to go.\nNineveh is danger. Nineveh is discomfort. Nineveh is whatever you hate that God loves deeply.\nWhat do you do when God says, “Go to Nineveh,” and you hate those people? You need to think about that because sooner or later, that’s what he’s going to say.\nThe Man God Chose\nWhen God said, “Arise, Jonah. Go to Nineveh and preach against it,” we might expect the next verse to read, “And Jonah arose and went to Nineveh.\"\nBut that’s not what happened. Verse 3 says he ran from the Lord and headed for Tarshish:\nBut Jonah ran away from the LORD and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the LORD.\nIt helps to know a little geography at this point. Nineveh was 500 miles north and east of where Jonah was.  It was a major city on the banks of the Tigris River. In contemporary terms, that would be in Iraq, about 300 miles north of Baghdad. Archeologists have found the ruins of ancient Nineveh right outside the city of Mosul in Iraq. Tarshish was almost 2000 miles west in Spain.  So we’ve got a 2500 mile “gap” between God’s call and Jonah’s desire.\nGod said, “Go east.\"\nJonah said, “I’m going west.”\nThe text says that Jonah went “down” to Joppa. That’s true on two levels. First, to get to Joppa, Jonah had to go “down” to the seacoast to the port of Joppa. Second, by going to Joppa he was going “down” spiritually.\nIf you look at the action in this chapter, you can see that Jonah went “down” four times:\nHe went “down” to Joppa (v. 3).\nHe went “down” into the hold of the ship (v. 4).\nHe went “down” into the sea (v. 15).\nHe went “down” into the belly of the great fish (v. 17).\nThat’s not a coincidence. It’s a statement about what happens when we disobey God’s call. Any time you run from God, you never go “up\"; you always go “down.\"\nAny time you run from God, you never go “up\"; you always go “down.”\nWhy did the reluctant prophet run from God?\n1. He didn’t want to go to Nineveh.\n2. He didn’t care about Nineveh.\n3. He didn’t think God should care about Nineveh.\n4. He didn’t want them to repent.\n5. He didn’t want a God who loved people like that.\nIt was perfectly fine with him if God sent them straight to hell. In fact, that was his preference. Jonah’s problem was never ultimately about Nineveh. Jonah’s problem was always with God.\nThe Path Jonah Took\nSo Jonah has decided to run from God. He heads for Joppa where he just “happens” to find a boat going where he wants to go.\nWhat are the chances?\nIsn’t that an amazing coincidence?\nIt’s a long way from Joppa to Tarshish. It’s not like they had a boat leaving for Tarshish every day. Think about that.\nWhen we decide to disobey God, there is always a boat going to Tarshish.\nAnd there is always room for one more passenger.\nWhen we decide to disobey God, there is always a boat going to Tarshish.\nWhat are the chances that a man would have the money in his pocket to pay the fare for a ship that happened to be going where he wanted to go?\nWhen we decide to run from the Lord, Satan is happy to provide the transportation.\nSo he found a ship and paid the fare with the money he had. There’s a lesson here to be considered. Money gives us options. If a man has no money, he can’t buy a ticket to Tarshish. If you’ve got money in your pocket, it may actually make it easier for you to run from the Lord.\nIn thinking about this, I pondered the excuses Jonah might have given for running from the Lord. Here are a few things he might have said:\n“God is calling me to Tarshish.”\n“They need the Lord in Tarshish too.”\n“I’ve prayed about it.”\n\"I have peace in my heart about this decision.”\n“Look at the circumstances. I had the money. The ship just happened to be there. It must be God’s will.”\n“I love Nineveh, but I’m not the right person to reach those people.”\n\"I just feel like going to Tarshish is the right thing to do.”\nWhenever we decide to disobey, we can always find an excuse. It’s easy to justify wrong-doing by cloaking it in religious language.\nWhenever we decide to disobey, we can always find an excuse. \nHow Far?\nAs we stand back and look at this story, a question naturally arises. How far will God let us go in sin? I don’t think anyone knows the full answer, but it appears that sometimes the answer is that God will let us go pretty far. He doesn’t always stop us quickly. I received an email from a woman who told me that her husband had left her for another woman. This is part of what she wrote:\n“I am working through forgiveness, it is a moment by moment process. My conviction right now is not to divorce him.”\n“Our church has pursued him, friends, Elders, Pastor, letters... he has changed so much. He is “under” church discipline now and is no longer a member.”\n“I fear for my husband.”\n“I didn’t even get to the part where God has pursued me with His great love in so many, many, many ways.”\nHow far will God let us go?  Why doesn’t he stop us sooner? My answer is that part of his judgment is not to stop us.\nHe could have arranged things so the ship went to a different port.\nHe could have arranged things so the ship had no room for Jonah.\nHe could have arranged things so a thief robbed Jonah of his money.\nSometimes the judgment of God is simply that God lets us go on and on in our sin so that we have to face the consequences of our own disobedience. This is the “severe mercy” of the Lord. That’s what Romans 1 means when it repeatedly says that “God gave them over” (Romans 1:24,26,28). When a society decides that it doesn’t need God, his response is not always to bring out the lightning and thunder. More often than not, God says, “If you want to jump off the cliff, I have warned you time and again, but if that’s what you want to do, I will not stop you.”\nHow far will God let us go in sin? I don’t think anyone knows the full answer.\nAs we consider the beginning of Jonah’s sad story, remember that we can run but we can’t hide. God was with Jonah every step of the way. Though Jonah tried to leave the Lord, the Lord never left him.\nIt is the patience of God that allows us to run away.\nIt is the wisdom of God that provides the ship.\nIt is the providence of God that sends the storm.\nIt is the kindness of God that sends the great fish.\nIf God didn’t care, he would let us go on in our sin forever.\nAs we come to the end of this message, it looks like Jonah has gotten away with it. He’s run from God, bought a ticket, and now he’s on a ship heading for Tarshish. He’s a happy camper. So far his plan has worked to perfection. He’s so happy that as our story ends, he’s going to take a nap (Jonah 1:5).\nIt is the kindness of God that sends the great fish.\nBut God is not through yet. He’s just getting started. Write over this story the words of Proverbs 14:12, “There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.”\nThree Final Thoughts\nAs we wrap up this message, here are three thoughts to ponder:\n1. Every step out of the will of God is a downward step.\nNo one ever disobeyed God and went up. You only go down.\n“Down” to Joppa.\n“Down” in the belly of the great fish.\n2.   We get away quickly, we recover slowly.\nIt’s easy to go down, easy to get off the right path, easy to fall into sin. But the road back is difficult and often very painful.\n3.  Satan can work through circumstances just like God can.\nSatan has his ships, and he always has room on his ships. His ships always go where we want to go when we’re running from God. He can make disobedience look good by means of favorable circumstances.\nAs he gets ready to take a nap, Jonah may have thought, “Things are going so well for me. This must be God’s will.” But if he thought that, he was wrong. The Lord had already made his will clear. No set of favorable circumstances can override what God has clearly said. Down deep he knew God’s will. He just didn’t want to do it.\nNo set of favorable circumstances can override what God has clearly said. \nI began by saying that I am calling this series on Jonah “Outrageous Grace.” You may wonder, “Where is the grace of God in this story?” The answer is simple. He let Jonah disobey. He didn’t kill him on the spot. He gave him the freedom to mess up his own life. That didn’t seem like grace at the time, but it was. God works even in the midst of our disobedience to bring us to himself. Sometimes God lets us go way off course so that when we finally see our sin for what it is, we are ready to return to the Lord.\nMeanwhile Jonah’s disobedience looks pretty good so far. “Happy sailing, Jonah. Watch out for that big fish.”\nThis is how life really works. Sin looks good for awhile. Jonah experienced the “pleasures of sin for a season.” If sin always brought immediate misery, it would be a lot less attractive to us. Stolen water may be sweet, but it leads you to the gates of hell.\nThe bitterness comes later.\nThe sadness comes later.\nSin is fun for a while. Be not deceived. God is not mocked. Jonah is about to find that out the hard way.\nStay tuned for the rest of the story.\nFather, we’re glad that your grace is greater than our sin. Some of us have loved ones who seem to be living the high life on the ship to Tarshish. Some people seem to have gotten away with disobedience. Lord, we wonder where you are.\nMaybe some of us right now are looking to take a ride on a ship heading for Tarshish. Speak to us. Wake us up. Help us to believe more deeply in your outrageous grace. In Jesus’ name, Amen.",
                "GOD TOLD JONAH \"GO\" - JONAH SAID \"NO\" - Rejoice Marriage Ministries, Inc.\nGOD TOLD JONAH \"GO\" –\nJONAH SAID \"NO\"\nThe word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai: “Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me.” But Jonah ran away from the LORD and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the LORD. Jonah 1:1-3\nHave you felt like running from the Lord when He tells you to do something that you do not want to do? Do you argue and debate the Lord when He tells you to apologize to your spouse, your children or someone when you may have had a tone or attitude with them? Has the Lord been telling you to get involved in your church by joining the choir, helping in the nursery or assisting in a children’s Bible Study class? This summer pray if you should offer to help with Vacation Bible School. How many excuses have you made refusing to help others? Has the Lord convicted you to talk to one of your family members or a close friend about the Lord and what He is doing in your life?\nThe Old Testament book of Jonah reads like a story book where God tells Jonah to “Go” and Jonah says, “No.” Tonight as part of your devotions, read the four small chapters and see that this Book in the Bible is not about a fish; but about Jonah being disobedient to doing the will of God. The Word of the Lord came to Jonah. He ran away from God's call and plan, refusing to deliver God's message to Nineveh.\nHas the Lord been speaking to you in many different ways as you are experiencing marriage problems or a separation or a divorce? Have you been told to stand up and fight against the hopelessness of your marriage or divorce that is attacking your family? Will you stand in the gap for your husband or wife even though on both sides of you and your spouse's family there has been nothing but divorce? Start now and pray against the generational sins on both sides of your family tonight.\nI believe that the Lord is calling you to break the curse of divorce, adultery, alcohol or drugs that have been attacking your loved ones by the Lord shedding His Blood on the cross at Calvary. Jesus Christ has paid the price and wants to break the curse of any addiction or break the strongholds that are being passed on from one generation to another. What is the Lord asking you to do? Are you choosing to obey Him or are you refusing to do what He wants you to do?\nJonah planned to travel in the opposite direction from where God had instructed him to go. Jonah did not want Ninevah to repent or be spared God's judgment. The Bible relates that, “Jonah paid the fare” to go on a ship.\nGod sent a great storm on the Mediterranean Sea in order to convince Jonah to obey His calling. Because of Jonah's disobedience, the lives of the sailors aboard the ship were at risk. May you and I never forget that God will get each of our attentions now or later and in many different ways. Do not worry how the Lord will speak to your spouse, allow the Holy Spirit to deal with them. There are consequences to sin, but also consequences to disobedience. Your Lord would rather go and tell sinners about Jesus sparing, saving, and changing their hearts, minds and souls than punishing them.\nThen the LORD sent a great wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up. All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship.  Jonah 1:4-5\nWhen you attempt to board that ship of disobedience, it will take you the opposite direction from marriage restoration. You will be running away from God and there is a price to be paid. The price will not only be paid by you, but by your spouse, your children and future generations as well. The greatest price might be paid by your prodigal spouse never coming to a saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. Is it possible that you are the only one who may have been chosen to pray for your spouse's salvation? Giving up your stand may mean the difference between Heaven or Hell for your one flesh husband or wife.\nWhen you got married, did you marry for life? Do you remember your wedding vows? I believe the wedding vows explain the different times in our married lives when we are going to have to go through tough times or one of you may be very seriously ill.\nThen the sailors said to each other, “Come let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity.” They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah…The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, “What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?” “Pick me up and throw me into the sea,” he replied, “and it will become calm. I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you.”  Jonah 1:7, 11-12\nAs the sailors threw Jonah overboard, they feared God and offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows to him. Pray that your spouse, the other person or loved ones will learn to fear the Lord, stop running from God or be willing to listen about needing Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of their lives. Ask the Lord to send more than one messenger of God to be around your spouse who will share with them about their own personal walks with the Lord regularly, living a life of integrity, obedience and showing a love for others.\nInstead, the men did their best to row back to land. But they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before. Then they cried to the LORD, “O LORD, please do not let us die for taking this man's life. Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, O LORD, have done as you pleased.” Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm. At this the men greatly feared the LORD, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows to him. But the Lord provided a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights.  Jonah 1:13-16 17\nIs the sea of your life very rough right now? Does it appear a great “fish” is about to swallow you up? Do not give in to fear, but cry out to the Lord to rescue and save you from the stormy seas that you are in, as He is right there to protect you. If Jonah had not been protected inside a fish, he would have become victim to the depths of the sea.\nBut Jonah received God's mercy and grace and was delivered from the rough sea of waves that would have swallowed Jonah to the bottom of the sea. Once Jonah was inside the fish, He prayed to the Lord in distress and then started thanking the Lord for saving him. Jonah then vowed to obey God and complete His assignment. The Lord spoke to the fish and it vomited Jonah onto dry land. If you are running from God's will, remember Jonah. God does give each of us other chances to pray, “Lord, forgive me for not obeying you.”\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time: “Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.” Jonah obeyed the word of the LORD and went to Nineveh.  Jonah 3:1-3a\nHas the Lord spoken to you regarding standing for your marriage? Have you gone the opposite direction? Are the circumstances of your marriage about to drown you? Are you in the belly of the whale trying to find a way out? Will you follow Jonah's example and start praying, crying out to God again? He is the God of second chances. Don't give up on God because He hasn't given up on you, your spouse or any rebellious children.\nGod delivered Jonah from where he had run away from God to where he should have been. Don't turn toward the Tarshish of divorce. Turn around and allow your Heavenly Father to carry you to city of Ninevah to proclaim God’s message of marriage restoration and then your marriage will be restored!\nLet us praise the Lord,\nCharlyne Steinkamp",
                "Jonah: The Runaway Prophet | SharperIron\nJonah: The Runaway Prophet\nMercy\nJonah: a paradox\nJonah is “a paradox: a prophet of God, and yet a runaway from God: a man drowned, and yet alive: a preacher of repentance, yet one that repines at repentance.” 1\nIn the early part of Joash’s reign, Jonah prophesied the restoration of Israel’s northern borders lost in wars with Syria and a time of prosperity and safety that would follow to rival the nation’s former greatness. 2 However, in her prosperity, Israel became complacent and arrogant thinking that they alone were the people under the divine favor and no other nation was so esteemed (Amos 9:7) by the Living God (Amos 6:1-8).\nExasperated with Israel’s unfaithfulness, God sent prophets to declare judgment against Israel warning them that He would use the Assyrians, whose capital city was Nineveh—a feared nation known for its cold-blooded barbarity—to punish and expel Israel from the land because of her sins (Hos. 9:3, 10:6, 11:5; Joel 1:6,7; Amos 9:11). In this setting God called Jonah to preach judgment against “Nineveh the great city for their wickedness” (NASB, Jon. 1:2). However, Jonah decided to make a run for it in the direction opposite Nineveh.\nJonah: his love for God and Israel\nSome commentators attribute Jonah’s action to moral faults in his character but such accusations are unwarranted and implicitly denied within the narrative. 3 In addition, there is the idea Jonah ran away because he was afraid for his own safety should he confront the powerful and evil people of Nineveh.\nIt is not expressly stated why Jonah “rose up to flee unto Tarshish 4 from the presence of Jehovah.” However, the implication may be set forth on this premise: Jonah was a faithful Jew more in tune with Yahweh’s revelatory character than other Jews of his time. He correctly apprehended God’s gracious character and anticipated God’s compassion to extend beyond the borders of the nation of Israel, His chosen people.\nAs such, Jonah did not want to take the chance that God would forgive Nineveh. Nineveh’s existence remained an omen of God’s judgment against Israel, threatening Israel’s national existence. It was Jonah’s concern for the people of God, and not rebellion or fear, which prompted his flight.\nJonah was aware of the ways of God all too well: “I knew that you were a gracious God, merciful, slow to get angry, and full of kindness: I knew how easily you would cancel your plans for destroying these people” (LBP, 5 Jon. 4:2). It was not in rebellion but rather in protest against God’s decision to destroy the nation of Israel for her sins. He was taking the same stance as Moses who confronted God in order to protect God, that is, His reputation before the heathen nations (Ex. 32:9-13, 30-32). It was not fear for his own life, but love for God’s people that prompted Jonah’s run away from God.\nTorn between his love for Israel and his prophetic insight into God’s love for all men, Jonah ran away to escape his responsibility as God’s spokesman. He did not want to risk the chance that Nineveh would be spared if that would assure Israel’s divine punishment. Jonah “had shown himself prepared to forfeit his prophetic office, prepared to flee into exile, prepared even to resign life itself, rather than that Nineveh should be spared! Now such deliberate self-abandon…transforms his motive from apparent pettiness to something touchingly heroic.” 6\nJonah found a ship on its way to Tarshish in order to make good his escape. However, while taking flight to the “remotest part of the sea” (NASB, Ps. 139:7-12), he was relentlessly pursued by the “Hound of Heaven.” 7 While Jonah slept, and to the sailors’ terror, the Lord caused “a great storm on the sea so that the ship was about to break up.”\nHaving found out the reason for the storm, the crew finally took Jonah’s advice and reluctantly threw him overboard leaving him to drown. However, God “had arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah,” preserving his life. At the end of three days’ confinement in the belly of the “great fish,” Jonah made his lamentation to God; being at the end of his rope, he repented, promising to obey God’s commands (Jon. 2:7-9).\nAgain, God repeated His command to Jonah (3:1-2). This time Jonah complied and went “to Nineveh according to the word of the Lord” (LBP, 3:3). Once deep inside the city, Jonah proclaimed that God’s judgment would be executed in forty days because of their wickedness. But, in contrast to the obstinacy of the covenant people, the “people of Nineveh believed God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth.” Even the king of Nineveh “arose from his throne, laid his robe from him, covered himself with sackcloth and ashes” and proclaimed a decree for all the people of the city to express repentance in the hope that God would be inclined to “withdraw His burning anger.” Seeing their earnest repentance, God did not destroy Nineveh as He had intended (NASB, 3:5ff).\nGod’s change of mind “greatly displeased Jonah, and he became angry.” Finding a place outside and in full view of the city, Jonah waited impatiently to see if God would destroy it. With ever increasing despondency, to the point of suicide, his hopes failed. Nineveh remained a threat to Israel because, unlike Nineveh, Israel refused to repent.\nJonah rested under the shelter of a plant provided by God to shield him from the scorching sun. As he slept, God then “appointed a worm…and it attacked the plant and it withered.” Consequently, the direct exposure to the sun made Jonah unbearably weak and he “begged with all his soul to die” adding to his sorrow over Nineveh’s repentance and God’s act of forgiveness (4:1-8).\nGod spoke tenderly to Jonah asking if it were proper for him to be angry that Nineveh was spared. Jonah answered that he had every right to be angry because, now that Nineveh was spared, he knew God would surely fulfill His intention to punish Israel—and why should Israel be punished and Nineveh be spared? Is not the nation of Israel God’s special people above all the nations? Are not Nineveh’s sins still deserving of, not pardon, but punishment? Though not surprised by God’s mercy towards the repentant people of Nineveh, nevertheless, Jonah implicitly accused God of having wronged His own people (4:9)!\nGod taught Jonah an important lesson (4:10-11). If Jonah could have compassion on that which concerns his own safety and comfort (and how limited in scope were his concerns!), did not God have the right to extend His compassion to those things that concern Him, especially to the helpless? Should compassion be limited to the people of Israel? Should mercy, on the one hand, be shown to those who persist in ignoring laws clearly presented and, on the other hand, judgment be exacted on those who are unaware of what they are doing? Should God punish the repentant in order to spare the unrepentant?\nJonah needed to learn that God’s special favor toward Israel did not mean a lessened love for others… The election of one nation did not mean the rejection of others! 8\nIsrael’s election does not prevent God’s mercy to others.\n[Jonah] confronts the reader with the serious…question whether his own response to human need is the same as that…exemplified by God. 9\nObservations\nI glean the following observations from the book of Jonah:\nThe favored status of a child of God does not exempt him from judgment; neither does another’s alienation from God exempt him from mercy. We should not take God’s mercy for granted just because one is His child. God who is quick to forgive is also certain to judge the unrepentant. No one sins with impunity. Neither should we resent the blessings God pours on those we judge to be less deserving (Matt 5:45b).\nUnderstanding is not a prerequisite for obeying God; neither is disobedience excusable even on noble grounds. When God’s command is clear, though seemingly unreasonable, our responsibility is not to take the time to understand, but to immediately obey. For example, we cannot shirk family responsibilities on grounds that we must spend time reading the Bible or going to church.\nThough God does not minimize the guilt of disobedience, He does bring His understanding of our reasons to bear in determining the proper discipline. At times our hearts may be right but our actions wrong as, for example, when Moses killed an Egyptian who was “beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren” (Ex. 2:11-12). Moses was cast off into the wilderness as a complete failure in his attempt to serve God, but for only a time, not permanently. In Jonah’s case, God appointed a “great fish” as his discipline, not to kill but to swallow him up alive. Jonah’s life was spared because of the hope that God had in him. He knows us and has pity on our strivings to do what is right (Ps. 103:14).\nFinally, and on a more personal note, human failure does not mean divine abandonment. Though Jonah ran away in disobedience to God’s command, God ran after Jonah, not to punish but to restore. A Christian may find that he is “on a shelf,” but this does not necessarily mean God is not at work in his life. God works to make the unwilling willing; the unprepared prepared; the not cared for, cared for.\nIt is my understanding, in sympathy with the story of Jonah, that a believer can be disqualified for service. However, disqualification does not necessarily constitute total rejection. As in Jonah’s case, God may decide to shut one away in isolation because of disobedience, anticipating the proper time to again call him to repentance and back into service (1 Cor. 9:27). 10\nAh my dear angry Lord,\nSince thou dost love, yet strike;\nCast down, yet help afford;\nSure I will do the like.\nI will complain, yet praise;\nI will bewail, approve:\nDiff. POV\nI never looked at Jonah quite this way.\nI think it's possible that \"moral faults\" were involved along with his nobler motives... and the case could be made that even when you do it out of love for your people, will disobedience to God is rebellion, nonetheless. But what gives me pause here is that it does seem likely that Jonah wasn't quite as bad a guy as I've represented him as in the past.\nSeems entirely plausible to me that he was not just a heartless guy who wanted to see Nineveh suffer... but viewed mercy on Nineveh (potential, then later, actual) as an even stronger indictment of his own nation and a hastening of its judgment.\nWelcome, etc.\ndrwayman, sometimes the worst way to be left out of a group is to not be the target of friendly ribbing while everyone else is, know what I mean? Although I'm sure he did mean to say that had you gone the other way he was ready to do some serious argumentation.\nJohnBrian doesn't really bite... unless you say something Arminian.\nAt any rate, welcome aboard.\nLee wrote:\nAll of the information we have about Jonah is found in the book of Jonah, with the exception of a brief mentioning in II Kings.\nI would counter that anything we know about Jonah's context we also know about Jonah. So, though it's true that the only direct info we have is Jonah, 2Kings and a couple of references in the Gospels, we know much more about Jonah's context.\nHaving said that, I didn't detail my point there and left it in question form because I didn't have time to go back and refresh my memory on Jonah's context. I suspect the sources Nelson cited for the essay did their homework before they put their ideas in print, but you can never be 100% of that... or whether you'd agree with their analysis of \"their homework.\"\nSo what I'd want to look for is where Jonah fits in the chronology of the OT and what sort of prophetic witness had occurred in the recent past/contemporary with Jonah. I think there'd be insight there as to his possible mix of motivations.\n...and we should view it as a mix, I think. Most people don't do what they do for a single reason and we shouldn't assume that Jonah either cared about Israel's fate or hated Assyria and wanted to see them get what was coming to them. Some combination seems likely to me.\nBut as somebody has pointed out, the NT ref's to Jonah do also hint at the idea that what might happen to Nineveh would have powerful implications for Israel.\nThe presence of the book of Jonah in the OT argues for this also, since the OT (from Abraham on) is about God's dealings with Israel under His covenant with them (I speak of Moses not a \"covenant of grace.\") So it makes sense to me that part of the original purpose of the book being inspired and written down was to say something to Israel both about God's heart toward gentiles and also about His heart toward His chosen people.\nEnough\nnbanuchi wrote:\nDo you think I have brought sufficient and proper texts to bear to support the view expressed in my paper?\nWell, you can only say so much in one essay. There's definitely enough there to get the mental wheels turning and send readers off digging.... which is enough. Sometimes it's better to provide \"less than enough,\" so to speak, because it works better as a curiosity prompt, know what I mean?\nOn \"touchingly heroic\"... I do think Sidow Baxter is overstating his point a bit there. But I think I get his point. But sinners are capable of being wicked and--in a way--noble at the same time. (This is partly the ethical problem that Fletcher--if I'm remember the name right--aimed to solve in Situation Ethics. But his solution was to argue that when a person acts with the intention of love, that erases every other moral/ethical consideration. I would say that people can and do engage in sinful deeds all the time with at least partly beautiful motives. But the beautiful part doesn't alter the nature of the whole. If you dress a toad up in fine jewelry he's still a toad....but his jewelry is still fine.)\nLee wrote:\nThe central theme of the Book of Jonah is not about Jonah. It is not about Israel, nor is it about Assyria/Nineveh.... The central theme of Jonah is about God.\nI think you're getting close to doing what you're faulting Nelson for doing here. The book does not say it is \"about God.\" You're getting that by reconstructing the historical setting.... which is also what folks are doing who make a case that it is about Israel.\nAlso, you seem to have an underlying assumption that the book cannot be about more than one thing. Why would that have to be? Seems to me that it's about everything that gets significant attention in it, which would certainly have to include Jonah, his conduct and his heart. We can certainly argue for one primary theme and it's certainly likely that God's character is that theme. But even that conclusion requires making a case from other passages.\nSo the debate should really move away from \"Do we allow external evidence to shape our interpretation beyond what the individual book says?\" to \"Who is making the best case from external evidence?\"\nContext = external evidence\nAs a general rule, it's a good idea to read every book of the Bible in light of every other book of the Bible. That is, we can't fully develop a particular book's message without the context of teaching that is external to it.\nAs for \"about God and not about Israel.\" I've already argued that there is no reason why it cannot be \"about God\" and also about Jonah, and Nineveh and Israel.\nAnd I argued as well, a few posts before that, that the entire OT is \"about Israel\" as well as \"about God.\" The two cannot really be separated, because God is revealing Himself through His dealings with the covenant people. Furthermore, the first audience for the book of Jonah would have been the people of Israel/Judah. It was written with a message for them mainly in view and its message to us, much later, is derived from that.\nBut the statement \"It's about God\" and the statement \"It's about Israel\" are not mutually exclusive.\nI really don't know where the idea that a book of the Bible must have a single dominant theme comes from either, frankly. It's kind of conventional wisdom, but nobody says why.\nI grew up hearing \"The theme of Ephesians is...\" etc. talk pretty often. A funny thing happened: different teachers and commentators would claim different things as \"the theme.\"\nAs I acquired the skills to form my own convictions about themes, I found that the case for one or another as \"the\" was frequently not persuasive.\nIn any case, it would be interesting to see a thorough argument for the whole \"singularity of theme\" idea. I'm not personally convinced of it... even less convinced that it's very important to distinguish the dominance of theme #1 from theme #2 in a book's overall message.\nI.e., if we've got the top three themes, we've got what we need. Which is #1 seems both unimportant and impossible to determine for certain. (But I'll grant that there are probably a few books that are pretty clear on a singular theme... I just can't think of any off hand. I don't look at them that way.)\nFootnotes\nLee wrote:\nSince this is a likely scenario, how about posting a link to a sermon, written or audio, where someone has preached this message from Jonah.  2000 years of church history and hundreds of thousands of sermons on the internet, it shouldn't be too hard of a search.

                "Our Salvation: A Study in Jonah - The Bible Study Hour with Dr. James Boice\nOur Salvation: A Study in Jonah\nThe Prophet Who Ran Away\nThe word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai: “Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me.”\nBut Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the LORD ( Jonah 1:1-3 ).\nThe book of Jonah may be studied for many reasons, but a chief reason is for what it teaches about God's sovereignty. Sovereignty is a problem for some Christians in certain areas. There are areas in which it is not a problem, of course. For example, most of us do not have problems with God's rule in the area of natural law. Gravity is one illustration. God exercises his rule through gravity, and we do not have difficulty at this point. In fact, we are even somewhat reassured that objects conform to such laws. The point at which we do have problems is that at which the sovereign will of God comes into opposition with a contrary human will. What happens at this point? God could crush the human will and thereby accomplish His own purpose with a ruthless hand. There are times when He has done this, as in the contest between Moses and Pharaoh. But generally God does not. So what happens in such cases? Does God give up? Does He change His mind? Or does He accomplish His purposes in some other way, perhaps indirectly? The answer is in the book of Jonah.\nA Great Commission\nInterestingly enough, this is the point at which the book starts. For it begins with a commission to Jonah and with Jonah's refusal to heed it, In other words, the book of Jonah begins with a formal expression of God's sovereign will and with a man's determined opposition. We read, \"The word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai: 'Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me.' But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the LORD\" (verses 1-3).\nThere is some dispute as to the location of Tarshish. It has been identified with one of the cities of Phoenicia or with ancient Carthage. Most probably, Tarshish was on the far coast of Spain, beyond Gibraltar. And if this was so, it means that in his disobedience Jonah was determined to go as far as he possibly could go in the direction opposite from that in which God was sending him. Nineveh was east. Tarshish was west. We can visualize the geography if we imagine Jonah coming out of his house in Palestine, looking left down the long road that led around the great Arabian desert to the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, and then turning on his heel and going down the road to his right.\nWhy did he do it? We can imagine some possible reasons. We can imagine, first, that Jonah was overcome by thoughts of the mission's difficulties. They are expressed very well in the commission which God Himself gave Jonah. God told Jonah that Nineveh was a very \"great city,\" and indeed it was. In addition to what the book itself tells us — that the city was so large that it took three days to cross it and that it had sixty thousand infants or small children ( Jonah 4:11 ) — we also know that it was the capital of the great Assyrian Empire, that it had walls a hundred feet high and so broad that three chariots could run abreast around them. Within the walls were gardens and even fields for cattle. For a man to arrive all alone with a message from an unknown God against such a city was ludicrous in the extreme. What could one man do? Who would listen? Where were the armies that could break down such walls or storm such garrisons? The men of Nineveh would ridicule the strange Jewish prophet. If Jonah had been overcome with the thought of the difficulties of such a mission and so had fled to Tarshish because of them, we could well understand him. Yet there is not a word in the story to indicate that it was the difficulties that upset this rebellious prophet.\nPerhaps it was danger? The second word in God's description of the city is \"wickedness.\" If Jonah had taken note of that wickedness and had refused to obey for that reason, this too would be understandable. Indeed, the more we learn of Nineveh the more dangerous the mission becomes. We think of the prophecy of Nahum, for example. Nahum is written against the wickedness of Nineveh entirely, and the descriptions against it are vivid. \"Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without victims! The crack of whips, the clatter of wheels, galloping horses and jolting chariots! Charging cavalry, flashing swords and glittering spears! Many casualties, piles of dead, bodies without number, people stumbling over the corpses — all because of the wanton lust of a harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft. 'I am against you,' declares the LORD Almighty. 'I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame' \" ( Nahum 3:1-5 ).\nWhat was one poor preacher to do against such hardness? Would they not simply kill him and add his body to the already soaring heap of carcasses? Thoughts like these could have made Jonah afraid; and if he had been afraid, we would not blame him. But again, there is not a word in the story to indicate that it was the danger that turned Jonah in the opposite direction.\nWhat was the reason then? Well, in the fourth chapter of Jonah, after God had already brought about the revival and had spared the Ninevites from judgment, Jonah explains the reason, arguing that it was precisely because of this outcome that he had disobeyed originally. That is, he declares that he knew that God was gracious and that He was not sending him to Nineveh only to announce a pending judgment, but rather that Nineveh might repent. Jonah's own words are: \"O LORD, is this not what I said when I was still at home? That is why I was so quick to flee to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity\" ( Jonah 4:2 ).\nAs we read these words carefully we realize that the reason why Jonah did not want to go to Nineveh was that those who lived there were the enemies of his people, the Jews, and that he was afraid that if he did go to them with his message of judgment, they would believe it and repent and that God would bless them. And he did not want them blessed! God could bless Israel. But Jonah would be damned (literally) before he would see God's blessing shed upon these enemies. So he fled to Tarshish. We can understand Jonah's motives if we can imagine the word of the Lord coming to a Jew who lived in New York during World War II telling him to go to Berlin to preach to Nazi Germany. Instead of this, he goes to San Francisco and there takes a boat for Hong Kong.\nWe may laugh at that, of course. But before we laugh too hard we should ask whether or not we are in the spiritual ancestry of Jonah. True, we have never been sent to Nineveh, and we may never have run away to Tarshish. But the commission that has been given to us is no less demanding than Jonah's, if we are Christians, and often our attempts to avoid it are no less determined than his were.\nWhat was Jonah's commission? \"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it\" ( Jonah 1:2 KJV). It consisted of three main words. He was told to \"arise.\" He was told to \"go.\" He was told to \"cry.\" This is precisely what we have been told to do in the Great Commission. We are to arise from wherever we happen to be seated. We are to go into all the world. And we are to cry against the world's wickedness, teaching it all that we have been taught by Jesus. Matthew's form of the Great Commission says, \"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age\" ( Matthew 28:19-20 ).\nWings of Dawn\nVerse three tells us of Jonah's attempt to get away from God, and it gives us the consequences of that attempt. It is surprising that Jonah did not know of these consequences before he ran or consider how impossible it is to escape God.\nWe must remember at this point that Jonah lived relatively late in Old Testament history, certainly long after the psalms were written, and that he therefore knew or had ample opportunity to know those great words in Psalm 139 : \"Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast\" ( Psalm 139:7-10 ). Did Jonah know these words? Probably. Then why did he not remember them as he set out in the ship for Tarshish?\nAs I read that psalm I find myself wondering if the name of the ship upon which Jonah set out might not have been The Wings of Dawn. The story does not give the name of the ship. But that is a good name for a ship; and if the ship of the book of Jonah were so named, it would be an irony well suited to Jonah's situation. Did he notice the name, if this is what it was? Did he notice the rats getting off as he stepped on? If I understand sin and disobedience at all, I suspect that Jonah noticed none of these things, so set was he in this folly. No more do we when we take our \"wings of dawn\" to sail away from God across life's sea.\nGod’s Sovereignty\nAt this point we find our first great lessons regarding God's sovereignty. For built into Jonah's first attempts to get away from God are two results which will inevitably follow whenever anyone tries to disobey Him. These results are in verse three, that is, one verse before the one that tells of God's special intervention in sending the storm after Jonah's ship. God has His special interventions too. But the fact that these occur before this indicates that they are as inevitable in spiritual matters as physical laws are in the physical universe.\nThe first result is that Jonah's course was downhill. He would not have described it that way. He would have said that he was improving his lot in life, just as we also do when we choose our own course instead of God's. But it was downhill nevertheless. In verse three, we are told that Jonah went \"down\" to Joppa and that having paid his fare he went \"down\" into the ship (see Jonah 1:3 KJV). This is not accidental in a story in which the words are as carefully chosen as this one. Nor are these two instances of the word \"down\" isolated. Two verses farther on, in verse five (KJV), we are told that Jonah had gone \"down\" into the sides of the ship, that is, below decks. Then in chapter 2, verse 6 (KJV), in a prayer which takes place after Jonah has been thrown overboard by the sailors, Jonah describes how he had gone \"down\" to the bottom of the earth's mountains beneath the waves. That is a lot of going down! Down, down, down, down. But it is always that way when a person runs from the presence of the Lord. The way of the Lord is up! Consequently, any way that is away from Him is down. The way may look beautiful when we start. The seas may look peaceful and the ship attractive, but the way is still down.\nThere is another result. In his excellent preaching on Jonah, Donald Grey Barnhouse often called attention to this by highlighting the phrase \"he paid his fare\" (KJV). He noted that Jonah did not get to where he was going, since he was thrown overboard, and that he obviously did not get a refund on his ticket. So he paid the full fare and did not get to the end of his journey. Now, says Barnhouse, it is always that way. \"When you run away from the Lord you never get to where you are going, and you always pay your own fare. On the other hand, when you go the Lord's way you always get to where you are going, and He pays the fare.\" 1\nJonah illustrates one-half of that statement. The story of Moses' mother, Jochebed, illustrates the other half. Jochebed conceived Moses during a time of great persecution by the Egyptians, a time in which the young male children were being thrown into the river to die. When the child was born, Jochebed and her husband, Amram, tried to hide him as long as possible, suspecting, I believe, that this was the one who had been promised by God to be the deliverer of the people. But at last the baby's cries grew too loud, and another plan was necessary. The mother made a little boat of bulrushes, covering it with tar. She placed Moses in it and set it in the reeds by the river's bank. Then she stationed Moses' sister, Miriam, at a distance to see what would become of him. Though she wanted her baby more than anything else in the world, Jochebed trusted the matter to God, allowing Him to do as He wished with her and the child.\nThe daughter of Pharaoh came down to the river, and when she saw the ark in the water she sent her maids to fetch it. When it was opened she saw the baby. He was crying. This so touched the woman's heart that she determined to save him and raise him in the palace. But what was she to do? Obviously the child needed a wet nurse. Where could she find one?\nAt this point, Miriam, who had been watching from a distance, came forward and asked if she could be of assistance. \"Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?\" Miriam asked.\n\"Yes,\" said the princess. So Jochebed was brought.\nAt this point Jochebed is about to receive back the child she most dearly wanted. She would have done anything to have had him. She would have scrubbed floors in the palace, anything. In fact, suppose the daughter of the Pharoah had said, \"I am going to give you this child to raise. But I want you to know that I have seen through your stratagem. I know that this young girl was not up on that hill watching by accident. She must be the sister of this baby and, therefore, you must be the mother. You can have your child. But as a sign of your disobedience to the Pharoah, I am going to cut off your right hand...\" Well, if she had said that, Moses' mother would have held out both hands if only she could have had the child back. But that is not what happened. Instead Pharaoh's daughter gave her the child, declaring, \"Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you\" ( Exodus 2:9 ).\n\"I will pay you.\" That is the point for which I tell the story. Jonah went his own way, paid his own fare, and got nothing. Jochebed went God's way. Consequently, God paid the fare, and she got everything. So I repeat: When you run away from the Lord you never get to where you are going, and you always pay your own fare. But when you go the Lord's way you always get to where you are going, and He pays the fare.\nBut the Lord\nNow in one sense Jonah's story is over at this point. That is, the story of his choice, his disobedience, is over. God has given His command. Jonah has disobeyed. Now Jonah must sit back and suffer the consequences as God now intervenes supernaturally to alter the story. This point is made very clear by the contrast between the first two words of verse three (\"But Jonah\") and the first three words of verse four (\"But the Lord\" KJV). It is true that Jonah has rejected God. He has voiced his little \"but,\" as we sometimes do. He is allowed to do it. God's sovereignty does not rule it out. But now God is about to voice His \"BUT,\" and His \"but\" is more substantial than Jonah's.\nWhat does God do? Well, He does three great things. First, He sends a great storm. The text indicates that it was a storm of unusual ferocity, so fierce that even experienced sailors were frightened. I never read about it that I do not think of that other storm that also frightened experienced men on the lake of Galilee. The men were Christ's disciples, and Christ was with them, although asleep in the boat. For awhile they rowed. But they were in danger of sinking and were afraid. So they awoke Jesus and cried, \"Lord, save us! We're going to drown!\"\nJesus replied, \"You of little faith, why are you so afraid?\" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. The disciples were amazed and asked \"What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!\" (see Matthew 8:23-27 ).\nThe Lord who can calm the troubled waters of your life is the same Lord who can stir them up to great frenzy. What He does depends upon whether He is with you in the boat or, which is a better way of putting it, whether or not you are with Him. If Jesus is in your boat — if you are going His way and are trusting Him — then, when storms come, you can cry out, \"Oh, Master, help me!\" and He will calm the violence. But if you are running from Him — if He is not in your boat and you are disobeying Him — then He will stir the waves up.\nSecond, the Lord prepared a great fish. Farther on in the story we read that God also prepared a small worm to eat the root and so destroy the plant that shaded Jonah. So we notice that, on the one hand. God used one of the largest creatures on earth to do His bidding and that, on the other hand, he used one of the smallest. Apparently it makes no difference to God. He will use whatever it takes to get the disobedient one back into the place of blessing. Are you running away from God? If so, he may use the cankerworm to spoil your harvest. He may use the whirlwind to destroy your barns and buildings. If necessary, He will touch your person. He will use whatever it takes, because He is faithful to Himself, to you, and to His purposes.\nFinally, God saved a great city. This last act, like the others, is an act of great mercy. For the city did not deserve His mercy. Yet He saved it, thereby preserving it from destruction for a time.\nGod is so determined to perfect His good work in us that He will continue to do so with whatever it takes, regardless of the obedience or disobedience of the Christian. Will you go in His way? If you do, you will find the way smoothed out and filled with great blessings.\n© Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals Inc, 1716 Spruce St. Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA\nThe Alliance calls the twenty-first century church to a modern reformation through broadcasting, events, and publishing.

                "Prince Hamlet is the title character and protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. He is the Prince of Denmark, nephew to the usurping Claudius, and son of King Hamlet, the previous King of Denmark. At the beginning of the play, he struggles with whether, and how, to avenge the murder of his father, and struggles with his own sanity along the way. By the end of the tragedy, Hamlet has caused the deaths of Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and  two acquaintances of his from the University of Wittenberg Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. He is also indirectly involved in the deaths of his love Ophelia (drowning) and of his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius by mistake).\n\nRole in the play\n\nThe play opens with Hamlet deeply depressed over the recent death of his father, King Hamlet, and his uncle Claudius' ascension to the throne and hasty marriage to Hamlet's mother Gertrude. One night, his father's ghost appears to him and tells him that Claudius murdered him in order to usurp the throne, and commands his son to avenge his death.\n\nClaudius sends for two of Hamlet's friends from Wittenberg, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to find out what is causing Hamlet so much pain. Claudius and his advisor Polonius convince Ophelia—Polonius' daughter and Hamlet's true love—to speak with Hamlet while they secretly listen. Hamlet enters, contemplating suicide (\"To be, or not to be\"). Ophelia greets him, and offers to return his remembrances, upon which Hamlet questions her honesty and tells her to \"get thee to a nunnery.\"\n\nHamlet devises a test to see whether Claudius is guilty: he hires a group of actors to perform a play about the murder of a king in front of the royal court, and has Horatio gauge Claudius' reaction. Claudius demands the play be stopped half through because it is the cause of his guilty conscience. When Claudius leaves the audience deeply upset, Hamlet knows that the ghost was telling the truth. He follows Claudius into his chambers in order to kill him, but stops when he sees his uncle praying; he does not want to kill Claudius while he is in a state of grace because Hamlet wants Claudius to suffer I purgatory and Claudius has just attempted to cleanse his sin through confession. A second attempt on Claudius' life ends in Polonius' accidental death.\n\nClaudius, now fearing for his life, sends Hamlet to England, accompanied (and closely watched) by Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Alone, Claudius discloses that he is actually sending Hamlet to his death. Prior to embarking for England, Hamlet hides Polonius' body, ultimately revealing its location to the King. Meanwhile, her father's death has driven Ophelia insane with grief, and Claudius convinces her brother Laertes that Hamlet is to blame. He proposes a fencing match between the two. Laertes informs the king that he will further poison the tip of his sword so that a mere scratch would mean certain death. Claudius plans to offer Hamlet poisoned wine if that fails. Gertrude enters to report that Ophelia has killed herself.\n\nIn the Elsinore churchyard, two \"clowns\", typically represented as \"gravediggers,\" enter to prepare Ophelia's grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of them, who unearths the skull of a jester whom Hamlet once knew, Yorick. Ophelia's funeral procession approaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet interrupts, professing his own love and grief for Ophelia. He and Laertes grapple, but the fight is broken up by Claudius and Gertrude.\n\nLater that day, Hamlet tells Horatio how he escaped death on his journey, disclosing that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have been sent to their deaths instead. A courtier, Osric, interrupts to invite Hamlet to fence with Laertes. Despite Horatio's warnings, Hamlet accepts and the match begins. After several rounds, Gertrude toasts Hamlet, accidentally drinking the wine he poisoned. Between bouts, Laertes attacks and pierces Hamlet with his poisoned blade; in the ensuing scuffle, Hamlet is able to use Laertes' own poisoned sword against him. Gertrude falls and, in her dying breath, announces that she has been poisoned.\nIn his dying moments, Laertes reveals Claudius' plot. Hamlet stabs Claudius with the poisoned sword, and then forces him to drink from his own poisoned cup to make sure he dies. In his final moments, Hamlet names Prince Fortinbras of Norway as the probable heir to the throne. Horatio attempts to kill himself with the same poisoned wine, but is stopped by Hamlet, so he will be the only one left alive to give a full account of the story. He then wills the throne of Denmark to Fortinbras before dying.\n\nViews of Hamlet\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward view sees Hamlet as seeking truth in order to be certain that he is justified in carrying out the revenge called for by a ghost that claims to be the spirit of his father. The 1948 movie with Laurence Olivier in the title role is introduced by a voiceover: \"This is the tragedy of a man who could not make up his mind.\"\n\nT. S. Eliot offers a similar view of Hamlet's character in his critical essay, \"Hamlet and His Problems\" (The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism). He states, \"We find Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' not in the action, not in any quotations that we might select, so much as in an unmistakable tone...\".\n\nOthers see Hamlet as a person charged with a duty that he both knows and feels is right, yet is unwilling to carry out. In this view, his efforts to satisfy himself on Claudius' guilt and his failure to act when he can are evidence of this unwillingness, and Hamlet berates himself for his inability to carry out his task. After observing a play-actor performing a scene, he notes that the actor was moved to tears in the passion of the story and compares this passion for an ancient Greek character, Hecuba, in light of his own situation:\n\nO, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\nThat from her working all his visage wan'd;\nTears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\nWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!\nFor Hecuba?\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\nThat he should weep for her? […]\n\nEtymology of his name\n\nThe name Hamlet occurs in the form Amleth in a 13th-century book of Danish History written by Saxo Grammaticus, popularised by François de Belleforest as L'histoire tragique d'Hamlet, and appearing in the English translation as \"Hamblet\". The story of Amleth is assumed to originate in Old Norse or Icelandic poetry from several centuries earlier. Saxo has it as Amlethus, the Latin form of the old Jutish Amlethoe. In terms of etymology the Old Icelandic name Amlóði comes from the Icelandic noun Amlooi, meaning ‘fool,’ suggestive of the way that Hamlet acts in the play. Later these names were incorporated into Irish dialect as Amlodhe. As phonetic laws took their course the name’s spelling changed eventually leaving it as Amlaidhe. This Irish name was given to a hero in a common folk story. The root of this name is ‘furious, raging, wild.’ These are all meanings Shakespeare would have been aware of when deciding on the name for his longest play.  Revealingly, the Danish word for secret is hemmelig.\n\nInfluence of the Reformation\n\nIt has also been suggested that Hamlet's hesitations may also be rooted in the religious beliefs of Shakespeare's time. The Protestant Reformation had generated debate about the existence of purgatory (where King Hamlet claims he currently resides). The concept of purgatory is a Catholic one, and was frowned on in Protestant England. Hamlet says that he will not kill his uncle because death would send him straight to heaven, while his father (having died without foreknowledge of his death) is in purgatory doing penance for his sins. Hamlet's opportunity to kill his uncle comes just after the uncle has supposedly made his peace with God. Hamlet says that he would much rather take a stab at the murderer while he is frolicking in the \"incestuous sheets\", or gambling and drinking, so he could be sure of his going straight to hell.\n\nFreudian interpretation\n\nErnest Jones, following the work of Sigmund Freud, held that Hamlet suffered from the Oedipus complex. He said in his essay \"The Oedipus-Complex as an Explanation of Hamlet's Mystery: A Study in Motive\":\nHis moral fate is bound up with his uncle's for good or ill.  The call of duty to slay his uncle cannot be obeyed because it links itself with the call of his nature to slay his mother's husband, whether this is the first or the second; the latter call is strongly \"repressed,\" and therefore necessarily the former also. \n\nHarold Bloom did a \"Shakespearean Criticism\" of Freud's work in response.\n\nAs a mirror of the audience\n\nIt has also been suggested that Hamlet, who is described by Ophelia as \"th’ expectancy and rose of the fair state, / The glass of fashion and the mould of form\" (Act III, Scene i, lines 148-9), is ultimately a reflection of all of the interpretations possessed by other characters in the play—and perhaps also by the members of an audience watching him. Polonius, most obviously, has a habit of misreading his own expectations into Hamlet’s actions (\"Still harping on my daughter!\"), though many other characters in the play participate in analogous behaviour.\n\nGertrude has a similar tendency to interpret all of her son’s activities as the result of her \"o’erhasty marriage\" alone. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tend to find the stalled ambitions of a courtier in their former schoolmate’s behaviour, whereas Claudius seems to be concerned with Hamlet’s motivation only so far as it reveals the degree to which his nephew is a potential threat. Ophelia, like her father, waits in vain for Hamlet to give her signs of affection, and Horatio would have little reason to think that Hamlet was concerned with anything more pressing than the commandment of the ghost. And the First Gravedigger seems to think that Prince Hamlet, like that \"whoreson mad fellow\" Yorick, is simply insane without any need for explanation. Several critics, including Stephen Booth and William Empson have further investigated the analogous relationship between Hamlet, the play, and its audience.\n\nParallels with other characters\n\nOne aspect of Hamlet's character is the way in which he reflects other characters, including the play's primary antagonist, Claudius. In the play within a play, for instance, Gonzago, the king, is murdered in the garden by his nephew, Lucianus; although King Hamlet is murdered by his brother, in The Murder of Gonzago  - which Hamlet tauntingly calls \"The Mousetrap\" when Claudius asks \"What do you call the play?\" - the regicide is a nephew, like Prince Hamlet. However, it is also worth noting that each of the characters in the play-within-a-play maps to two major characters in Hamlet, an instance of the play's many doubles:\n\n* Lucianus, like Hamlet, is both a regicide and a nephew to the king; like Claudius, he is a regicide that operates by pouring poison into ears.\n* The Player King, like Hamlet, is an erratic melancholic; like King Hamlet, his character in The Murder of Gonzago is poisoned via his ear while reclining in his orchard.\n* The Player Queen, like Ophelia, attends to a character in The Murder of Gonzago that is \"so far from cheer and from [a] former state\"; like Gertrude, she remarries a regicide.\n\nHamlet is also, in some form, a reflection of most other characters in the play (or perhaps vice versa):\n\n* Hamlet, Laertes, Fortinbras and Pyrrhus are all avenging sons. Hamlet and Laertes both blame Claudius for the death of their fathers. Hamlet and Pyrrhus are both seized by inaction at some point in their respective narratives and each avenges his father. Hamlet and Fortinbras both have plans that are thwarted by uncles that are also kings.\n* Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Osric and Polonius are all courtiers.\n* Hamlet, his father, Bernardo, Marcellus, Francisco, Fortinbras and several other characters are all soldiers.\n* Hamlet and his father share a name (as do Fortinbras and his father).\n* Hamlet, Horatio, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and Laertes are all students.\n* Hamlet, his father, Gertrude and Claudius are all members of the Royal Family. Each of them is also killed by poison—poison that Claudius is responsible for.\n* Hamlet and Ophelia are each rebuked by their surviving parent in subsequent scenes; the surviving parent of each happens to be of the opposite gender. Both also enter scenes reading books and there is a contrast between the (possibly) pretend madness of Hamlet and the very real insanity of Ophelia.\n* Hamlet, Horatio, Polonius, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and Claudius are each \"lawful espials\" at some point in the play.\n\nHamlet's age\n\nIn Act V, scene I of Shakespeare's Hamlet, the First Gravedigger is asked by Hamlet at about line 147 and following, how long he has \"been a grave-maker.\" His reply appears to determine the age of Hamlet for us in a roundabout but very explicit manner. The Gravedigger says that he has been in his profession since the day that Old Hamlet defeated Old Fortinbras, which was \"the very day that young Hamlet was born.\" Then, a little later, he adds that \"I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.\"  According to this logic, Hamlet must be thirty years old.  Yorick, the dead jester whose skull Hamlet holds during this scene, is said to have been in the earth \"three-and-twenty years,\" which would make Hamlet no more than seven years old when he last rode on Yorick's back.\n\nThis view of Hamlet's age is supported by the fact that Richard Burbage, the actor who originally played the role, was thirty-two at the time of the play's premiere.\n\nHowever, a case has been madeRoth, Steve Hamlet: The Undiscovered Country  that at an early stage in Hamlet—with its apparent history of multiple revisions—Hamlet was presented as a sixteen-year-old. Several pieces of evidence support this view. Hamlet attends the University of Wittenberg, and royals and nobles (Elizabethan or medieval Danish) did not attend university at age 30. Additionally, a 30-year-old Prince Hamlet would clearly have been of ruling age.  Given his great popularity (mentioned by Claudius), this would raise the question of why it was not he, rather than his uncle, who was elected to succeed to the throne upon the death of King Hamlet.\n\nThe line about the length of the Gravedigger's career does not appear in the First Quarto of Hamlet; in that text Yorick is said to have been in the ground only twelve years.  Furthermore, in Belleforest, possibly one of Shakespeare's sources for the story, it is said that Amleth has \"not attained to man's estate.\"  And in the original spelling of the Folio text, one of the two authoritative texts for the play, the Gravedigger's answer to how long he has \"been a grave-maker\" reads \"Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene heere, man and Boy thirty yeares..\"  \"Sixteene\" is usually rendered as  \"sexton\" (a modernization of the second quarto's \"sexten\"), even in modern texts that take F1 as their \"copy text.\" But modernizing the punctuation—a normal practice in modernized texts—renders \"Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene heere—man and Boy thirty yeares.\"  In other words, this reading suggests that he has been a grave-digger for sixteen years, but that he has lived in Denmark for thirty.  According to this logic, then, it is the Grave-digger who is thirty, whereas Hamlet is only sixteen.\n\nAlthough the difference between a sexton and a grave digger must also be taken into account. A sexton oversees many different jobs around the church and surrounding areas. A grave digger simply digs graves. There are sextons also dig graves and some that do not. It is completely possible that the Gravedigger has been a sexton a for 30 years, but has not been digging graves for that entire time. This could be another example of the character's very round-about way of speaking.\n\nHowever, this reading has the disadvantage that in the Folio the length of time Yorick has been in the ground is said to be twenty-three years, meaning that he had been dead seven years by the time Hamlet was born.  Another theory offered is that the play was originally written with the view that Hamlet was 16 or 17, but since Shakespeare wrote his plays to be performed, and not read, these lines were likely changed so Burbage (who was almost always the protagonist in Shakespeare's plays) could play the role.\n\nPerformers\n\nBelow are listed some of the notable acting portrayals of Hamlet.\n\n;Stage\n*Richard Burbage originated the role of Hamlet at the Globe Theatre.\n*David Garrick made the role one of the centerpieces of his repertory in the 18th century.\n*Master Betty played the role at the height of his popularity in 1805, and the House of Commons once adjourned early so that members of Parliament could see him play it.\n*Edwin Booth was famous for the role in New York in the 1860s and 1870s.\n*Sir Henry Irving, the first actor to be knighted, played Hamlet for an unprecedented 200 consecutive performances at the Lyceum Theatre in London in 1874.\n*Mrs Powell was the first woman to appear in the role in London in 1796.\n*Johnston Forbes-Robertson played the role in 1898.\n*John Barrymore created a sensation with his performance on Broadway in 1922 and again when he took it to London in 1925.\n*John Gielgud played Hamlet over 500 times between 1930 and 1945.\n*Gustav Gründgens played Hamlet in the Staatliches Schauspielhaus in Berlin in 1936.\n*Laurence Olivier first played Hamlet at the Old Vic in 1937, later performing the production at Elsinore Castle.\n*Maurice Evans first played the part at the Old Vic Theatre in 1935 and had a triumph on Broadway in 1938 and 1945.\n*Paul Scofield played Hamlet at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1948 and again in 1955, directed by Peter Brook. \n*Richard Burton first played the role at the Old Vic Theatre in 1953 and returned to it in a 1964 Broadway production that became notorious when he married Elizabeth Taylor during its out-of-town tryout.\n*David Warner starred in Peter Hall's Hamlet in the RSC's August 1965 production at Stratford-Upon-Avon.\n*Richard Chamberlain was the first American actor to play the role in London since John Barrymore.

Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: We’re on the road broadcasting from Detroit, Michigan, from the studios of Detroit Public Television. This morning it was announced that Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai and Indian child rights activist Kailash Satyarthi have jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize. The chair of the Nobel committee, former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland, made the announcement this morning.\nTHORBJØRN JAGLAND: Ladies and gentleman, good morning. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2014 is to be awarded to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai for their struggle against oppression of young people and children, and children’s right to education. Children must go to school, not be financially exploited.\nAMY GOODMAN: At age 17, Malala Yousafzai is the youngest person ever to win a Nobel Prize. In 2012, she was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman who boarded her school bus. She survived and continued to campaign for the rights of girls to go to school. Kailash Satyarthi, age 60, has been a leader for decades in the international movement against child slavery and the exploitation of child workers. In a statement, the Nobel committee said it, quote, \"regards it as an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism.\"\nLast year, on July 12th, her 16th birthday, Malala Yousafzai appeared at the United Nations and delivered her first public speech since she underwent surgery, saying she was undeterred by the Taliban’s efforts to silence her voice. The event marked a global day in her honor. This is an extended excerpt of Malala Yousafzai’s address.\nMALALA YOUSAFZAI: Dear friends, on the 9th of October, 2012, the Taliban shot me on the left side of my forehead. They shot my friends, too. They thought that the bullet would silence us. But they failed. And out of that silence came thousands of voices. The terrorists thought that they would change my aims and stop my ambitions. But nothing changed in my life except this: Weakness, fear and hopelessness died; strength, power and courage was born. I am the same Malala. My ambitions are the same. My hopes are the same. And my dreams are the same.\nDear sisters and brothers, I am not against anyone. Neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group. I am here to speak up for the right of education of every child. I want education for the sons and daughters of the Taliban and all the terrorists and extremists. I do not even hate the Talib who shot me. Even if there is a gun in my hand and he stands in front of me, I would not shoot him. This is the compassion that I have learned from Muhammad, the prophet of mercy, and Jesus Christ and Lord Buddha. This the legacy of change that I have inherited from Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. This is the philosophy of nonviolence that I have learned from Gandhiji, Bacha Khan and Mother Teresa. And this is the forgiveness that I have learned from my father and from my mother. This is what my soul is telling me: Be peaceful and love everyone.\nToday, I am focusing on women’s rights and girls’ education because they are suffering the most. There was a time when women social activists asked men to stand up for their rights. But this time we will do it by ourselves. I’m not telling men to step away from speaking for women’s rights; rather, I am focusing on women to be independent, to fight for themselves.\nSo, dear sisters and brothers, now it’s time to speak up. So today, we call upon the world leaders to change their strategic policies in favor of peace and prosperity. We call upon the world leaders that all the peace deals must protect women’s and children’s rights. A deal that goes against the rights of women is unacceptable. We call upon all governments to ensure free, compulsory education all over the world for every child. We call upon all the governments to fight against terrorism and violence, to protect children from brutality and harm. We call upon the developed nations to support the expansion of education opportunities for girls in the developing world. We call upon all the communities to be tolerant, to reject prejudice based on caste, creed, sect, color, religion or agenda, to ensure freedom and equality for women so that they can flourish. We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back. We call upon our sisters around the world to be brave, to embrace the strength within themselves and realize their full potential.\nDear brothers and sisters, we want schools and education for every child’s bright future. We will continue our journey to our destination of peace and education. No one can stop us. We will speak up for our rights, and we will bring change through our voice. We believe in the power and the strength of our words. Our words can change the whole world, because we are all together, united for the cause of education. And if we want to achieve our goal, then let us empower ourselves with the weapon of knowledge, and let us shield ourselves with unity and togetherness.\nDear brothers and sisters, we must not forget that millions of people are suffering from poverty, injustice and ignorance. We must not forget that millions of children are out of their schools. We must not forget that our sisters and brothers are waiting for a bright, peaceful future. So let us wage—so let us wage a global struggle against illiteracy, poverty and terrorism. Let us pick up—let us pick up our books and our pens. They are our most powerful weapons. One child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world. Education is the only solution. Education first. Thank you.\nAMY GOODMAN: Malala Yousafzai, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last July on her 16th birthday. Today she became the youngest person ever to win a Nobel Prize. She shares the peace prize with Kailash Satyarthi, who’s been a leader for decades in the international movement against child slavery and the exploitation of child workers. He developed Rugmark, now known as Goodweave, which is a monitoring, labeling and certification system of rugs made in South Asia without child labor. The two will be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10th, International Human Rights Day, in Oslo. This is Democracy Now!

She is by far the youngest recipient since the awards began more than a century ago, and she insisted on Friday that her work had only just begun.\nThe Pakistani campaigner, who survived an assassination attempt at the age of 15, will share the $1 million prize with Kailash Satyarthi, an Indian activist who has dedicated his life to fighting for the rights of children.\nThe two Nobel laureates have pledged to work together on future campaigns and called on the leaders of their two quarreling nations to join them at the prize ceremony in December as a symbol of reconciliation.\nWhen the announcement was made, Malala was in Chemistry class at her school in Birmingham, England, where she sought refuge after surviving a shot to the head from a Taliban gunman. After being told that she had made history as the first Pakistani peace laureate and the youngest person to win any of the Nobel prizes, she moved on to Physics class and remained in school until classes let out that afternoon.\nAfter school, Malala described her emotions when a teacher came into class to share the news: “I felt more powerful and more courageous,” she said. “Because this award is not just a piece of metal or a medal you wear or an award you keep in your room. This is encouragement for me to go forward.”\nIt was Malala’s determination to get to class, despite the wishes of extremists in her native Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan, that would lead her to become one of the world’s most prominent education campaigners. Her refusal to cover her face and her willingness to speak out in defense of girls’ rights made her a target for the local Taliban commanders.\nTwo years ago, a gunman boarded her school bus and fired three shots at close range. Somehow she survived, even though one of the bullets struck her in the forehead. The Taliban plot to silence their young critic had backfired spectacularly. She continued to campaign—now with a worldwide audience.\nThe Nobel prize will amplify her voice ever louder, even as she insisted that she did not deserve to be honored and join the likes of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, and Nelson Mandela.\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee said Malala’s global impact at such a young age was truly extraordinary. “Despite her youth, Malala Yousafzai has already fought for several years for the right of girls to education, and has shown by example that children and young people, too, can contribute to improving their own situations,” said Thorbjørn Jagland, chairman of the committee. “This she has done under the most dangerous circumstances. Through her heroic struggle she has become a leading spokesperson for girls’ rights to education.”\nThough less well known in the West, Satyarthi has spent decades working to secure a brighter future for the millions of children in India who grow up in poverty with little access to education.\nThe Nobel committee said he was continuing in the noble tradition of  Mahatma Gandhi. Speaking of both Satyarthi and Yousafzai, Jagland said,  “The Nobel Committee regards it as an important point for a Hindu and a  Muslim, an Indian and a  Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against  extremism.”\nSatyarthi said he was dedicating the award to all of those he had not  yet been able to help. “It’s an honor to all those children still  suffering in slavery, bonded labor, and trafficking,” he said.\nMalala, a devout Muslim, has given voice to millions of fellow believers  who are disgusted by the extremists who twist the words of Islam to  suit their ultra-conservative beliefs. She was brave enough to stand up  to Taliban militants who  had forced the closure of scores of schools in northwest Pakistan,  close to the border of Afghanistan, where she grew up.\nEncouraged by her father, she began writing anonymously for BBC Urdu at the age of 11, charting her struggle to get the same education that was available to her brothers. Her writing won such widespread acclaim that her anonymity could not last.\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!\nDaily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.\nCheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).",
                "Malala Yousafzai - Biographical\nMalala Yousafzai\nThe Nobel Peace Prize 2014\nKailash Satyarthi, Malala Yousafzai\nShare this:\nMalala Yousafzai - Biographical\nMalala Yousafzai was born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, the largest city in the Swat Valley in what is now the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. She is the daughter of Ziauddin and Tor Pekai Yousafzai and has two younger brothers.\nAt a very young age, Malala developed a thirst for knowledge. For years her father, a passionate education advocate himself, ran a learning institution in the city, and school was a big part of Malala's family. She later wrote that her father told her stories about how she would toddle into classes even before she could talk and acted as if she were the teacher.\nIn 2007, when Malala was ten years old, the situation in the Swat Valley rapidly changed for her family and community. The Taliban began to control the Swat Valley and quickly became the dominant socio-political force throughout much of northwestern Pakistan. Girls were banned from attending school, and cultural activities like dancing and watching television were prohibited. Suicide attacks were widespread, and the group made its opposition to a proper education for girls a cornerstone of its terror campaign. By the end of 2008, the Taliban had destroyed some 400 schools.\nDetermined to go to school and with a firm belief in her right to an education, Malala stood up to the Taliban. Alongside her father, Malala quickly became a critic of their tactics. \"How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?\" she once said on Pakistani TV.\nIn early 2009, Malala started to blog anonymously on the Urdu language site of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). She wrote about life in the Swat Valley under Taliban rule, and about her desire to go to school. Using the name \"Gul Makai,\" she described being forced to stay at home, and she questioned the motives of the Taliban.\nMalala was 11 years old when she wrote her first BBC diary entry. Under the blog heading \"I am afraid,\" she described her fear of a full-blown war in her beautiful Swat Valley, and her nightmares about being afraid to go to school because of the Taliban.\nPakistan's war with the Taliban was fast approaching, and on May 5, 2009, Malala became an internally displaced person (IDP), after having been forced to leave her home and seek safety hundreds of miles away.\nOn her return, after weeks of being away from Swat, Malala once again used the media and continued her public campaign for her right to go to school. Her voice grew louder, and over the course of the next three years, she and her father became known throughout Pakistan for their determination to give Pakistani girls access to a free quality education. Her activism resulted in a nomination for the International Children's Peace Prize in 2011. That same year, she was awarded Pakistan's National Youth Peace Prize. But, not everyone supported and welcomed her campaign to bring about change in Swat. On the morning of October 9, 2012, 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban.\nSeated on a bus heading home from school, Malala was talking with her friends about schoolwork. Two members of the Taliban stopped the bus. A young bearded Talib asked for Malala by name, and fired three shots at her. One of the bullets entered and exited her head and lodged in her shoulder. Malala was seriously wounded. That same day, she was airlifted to a Pakistani military hospital in Peshawar and four days later to an intensive care unit in Birmingham, England.\nOnce she was in the United Kingdom, Malala was taken out of a medically induced coma. Though she would require multiple surgeries, including repair of a facial nerve to fix the paralyzed left side of her face, she had suffered no major brain damage. In March 2013, after weeks of treatment and therapy, Malala was able to begin attending school in Birmingham.\nAfter the shooting, her incredible recovery and return to school resulted in a global outpouring of support for Malala. On July 12, 2013, her 16th birthday, Malala visited New York and spoke at the United Nations. Later that year, she published her first book, an autobiography entitled \"I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.\" On October 10, 2013, in acknowledgement of her work, the European Parliament awarded Malala the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought.\nIn 2014, through the Malala Fund, the organization she co-founded with her father, Malala traveled to Jordan to meet Syrian refugees, to Kenya to meet young female students, and finally to northern Nigeria for her 17th birthday. In Nigeria, she spoke out in support of the abducted girls who were kidnapped earlier that year by Boko Haram, a terrorist group which, like the Taliban, tries to stop girls from going to school.\nIn October 2014, Malala, along with Indian children's rights activist Kailash Satyarthi, was named a Nobel Peace Prize winner. At age 17, she became the youngest person to receive this prize. Accepting the award, Malala reaffirmed that \"This award is not just for me. It is for those forgotten children who want education. It is for those frightened children who want peace. It is for those voiceless children who want change.\"\nToday, the Malala Fund has become an organization that, through education, empowers girls to achieve their potential and become confident and strong leader in their own countries. Funding education projects in six countries and working with international leaders, the Malala Fund joins with local partners to invest in innovative solutions on the ground and advocates globally for quality secondary education for all girls.\nCurrently residing in Birmingham, Malala is an active proponent of education as a fundamental social and economic right. Through the Malala Fund and with her own voice, Malala Yousafzai remains a staunch advocate for the power of education and for girls to become agents of change in their communities.\n \nFrom The Nobel Prizes 2014.

                "A teddy bear is a soft toy in the form of a bear. Developed apparently simultaneously by toymakers Morris Michtom in the U.S. and Richard Steiff in Germany in the early years of the 20th century, and named after President Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt, the teddy bear became an iconic children's toy, celebrated in story, song, and film.David Cannadine, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21265701  A point of view - The Grownups with teddy bears], 1 February 2013, (accessed 2013-02-01)  Since the creation of the first teddy bears which sought to imitate the form of real bear cubs, \"teddies\" have greatly varied in form, style and material.  They have become collector's items, with older and rarer \"teddies\" appearing at public auctions.  Teddy bears are among the most popular gifts for children and are often given to adults to signify love, congratulations, or sympathy.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name teddy bear comes from former United States President Theodore Roosevelt, who was commonly known as \"Teddy\" (though he loathed being referred to as such). The name originated from an incident on a bear hunting trip in Mississippi in November 1902, to which Roosevelt was invited by Mississippi Governor Andrew H. Longino. There were several other hunters competing, and most of them had already killed an animal.  A suite of Roosevelt's attendants, led by Holt Collier,  cornered, clubbed, and tied an American black bear to a willow tree after a long exhausting chase with hounds.  They called Roosevelt to the site and suggested that he should shoot it.  He refused to shoot the bear himself, deeming this unsportsmanlike, but instructed that the bear be killed to put it out of its misery,   and it became the topic of a political cartoon by Clifford Berryman in The Washington Post on November 16, 1902.  While the initial cartoon of an adult black bear lassoed by a handler and a disgusted Roosevelt had symbolic overtones, later issues of that and other Berryman cartoons made the bear smaller and cuter. \n\nMorris Michtom saw the drawing of Roosevelt and was inspired to create a teddy bear. He created a tiny soft bear cub and put it in the shop window with a sign \"Teddy's bear,\" after sending a bear to Roosevelt and receiving permission to use his name.  The toys were an immediate success and Michtom founded the Ideal Novelty and Toy Co.\n\nAt the same time in Germany, the Steiff firm, unaware of Michtom's bear, produced a stuffed bear from Richard Steiff's designs. Steiff exhibited the toy at the Leipzig Toy Fair in March 1903, where it was seen by Hermann Berg, a buyer for George Borgfeldt & Company in New York (and the brother of composer Alban Berg ). He ordered 3000 to be sent to the United States.  Although Steiff's records show that the bears were produced, they are not recorded as arriving in the U.S., and no example of the type, \"55 PB\", has ever been seen, leading to the story that the bears were shipwrecked. However, the story is disputed - Gunther Pfieffer notes that it was only recorded in 1953 and says it is more likely that the 55 PB was not sufficiently durable to survive until the present day.  Although Steiff and Michtom were both making teddy bears at around the same time, neither would have known of the other's creation due to poor transatlantic communication.\n\nNorth American educator Seymour Eaton wrote the children's book series The Roosevelt Bears,  while composer John Walter Bratton wrote an instrumental \"The Teddy Bears' Picnic\", a \"characteristic two-step\", in 1907, which later had words written to it by lyricist Jimmy Kennedy in 1932.\n \nEarly teddy bears were made to look like real bears, with extended snouts and beady eyes.  Modern teddy bears tend to have larger eyes and foreheads and smaller noses, babylike features that enhance the toy's cuteness.  Teddy bears are also manufactured to represent different species of bear, such as polar bears and grizzly bears, as well as pandas.\n\nWhile early teddy bears were covered in tawny mohair fur, modern teddy bears are manufactured in a wide variety of commercially available fabrics, most commonly synthetic fur, but also velour, denim, cotton, satin, and canvas.\n\nProduction\n\nCommercial\n\nCommercially made, mass-produced teddy bears are predominantly made as toys for children. These bears have safety joints for attaching arms, legs, and heads. They must have securely fastened eyes that do not pose a choking hazard for small children. These \"plush\" bears must meet a rigid standard of construction in order to be marketed to children in the United States and in the European Union.\n\nThere are also companies, like Steiff, that sell handmade collectible bears that can be purchased in stores or over the Internet.\nThe majority of teddy bears are manufactured in countries such as China and Indonesia. A few small, single-person producers in the United States make unique, non-mass-produced teddy bears. In the United Kingdom one small, traditional teddy bear company remains, Merrythought, which was established in 1930. \nMohair, the fur shorn or combed from a breed of long haired goats, is woven into cloth, dyed and trimmed. Alpaca teddy bears are made from the pelt of an alpaca because the fiber is too soft to weave. In addition to mohair and alpaca, there is a huge selection of \"plush\" or synthetic fur made for the teddy bear market. Both these types of fur are commercially produced.\n\nFile:Making of a teddy bear 1 cutting.jpg|1: Cutting\nFile:Making of a teddy bear 2 sewing and turning.jpg|2: Sewing and turning\nFile:Making of a teddy bear 3 filling.jpg|3: Filling\nFile:Making of a teddy bear 4 assembling.jpg|4: Assembling\n\nAmateur\n\nTeddy bears are a favourite form of soft toy for amateur toy makers, with many patterns commercially produced or available online. Many \"teddies\" are home-made as gifts or for charity, while \"teddy bear artists\" often create \"teddies\" for retail, decorating them individually with commercial and recycled ornaments such as sequins, beads and ribbons .  Sewn teddy bears are made from a wide range of materials including felt, cotton and velour. While many are stitched, others are made from yarn, either knitted or crocheted. Teddy bears are also made of plywood and a range of other craft materials.\n\nAntiques\n\nMichtom's jointed mohair “Teddy’s bear” was very popular when first designed and remains so with collectors today. Fake bears look suspiciously new and unhandled: their noses are unworn, and their seams may be thick and uneven. All Ideal bears have jointed hips, necks, and shoulders. Early examples have a characteristic “American football” shape and are mostly made of short, gold or beige mohair plush with matching felt paws, and distinctive, sharply pointed foot pads. They have shoe-button or glass eyes, and the fur around the muzzle may be shorn. Later bears were made in a large variety of colours and types - for example, pandas - and had longer fur.\n\nOther collectible bears include ones by the Knickerbocker Toy Co. (active 1924-5) in New York, which are clearly marked with a label in the front seam. Similar to many early American bears, Knickerbocker bears usually have long bodies, small feet, and short, straight arms and legs. Their later bears can be recognized by their large inverted ears and big noses. Other collectible bears include Gund Manufacturing Co. (est. 1898), now in New York, and “Hershey’s bears”, which were designed to promote The Hershey Company’s chocolate bars. \n\nImpact\n\nRetail sales of stuffed plush animals including teddy bears was $1.3 billion in 2006.  The most commonly sold brands include Gund and Ty Inc. Brands associated with teddy bears that enjoyed strong popularity in the 1980s and 1990s are Teddy Ruxpin and Care Bears. Various TV shows and movies have a teddy bear depicted, such as Super Ted and Mr. Bean.\n\nTeddy bears have seen a resurgence in popularity as international \"do-it-yourself\" chains have opened. Among the largest and best-known are Build-A-Bear Workshop and Vermont Teddy Bear Company.\n\nSome popular mass-marketed teddy bears made today include Rupert, Sooty, Paddington, and Pudsey Bear. Books have also been written with the teddy bear featured as their main character. These include Winnie-the-Pooh, Corduroy, Teddy Tells Time, Tristan the Teddy Bear (from the Teddy Bear Tales) and Teddy Dressing.\n\n\"The Teddy Bears' Picnic\"\n\nThe popularity of the toy inspired John Walter Bratton to compose the melody \"The Teddy Bears' Picnic\" (1907).  The lyrics were added in 1932 by Jimmy Kennedy.\n\nTeddy bear museums\n\nThe world's first teddy bear museum was set up in Petersfield, Hampshire, England, in 1984. In 1990, a similar foundation was set up in Naples, Florida, United States. These were closed in 2006 and 2005 respectively, and the bears were sold in auctions, but there are many teddy bear museums around the world today.\n\nTeddy Bear Cops program\n\nBecause police, fire and emergency officials found that giving a teddy bear to a child during a crisis stabilized and calmed them, NAPLC created the Teddy Bear Cops program to distribute teddy bears to police, fire, and emergency officials throughout the United States, for their use in providing teddy bears to children in emergencies. \n\nBrunus edwardii April fool\n\nOn April Fools' Day 1972, issue 90 of The Veterinary Record published a paper on the diseases of Brunus edwardii detailing common afflictions of teddy bears.  \n\nMovies\n\n*Winnie the Pooh is a 2011 American animated musical comedy film.\n*Ted is a 2012 comedy movie.\n*Paddington is a 2014 comedy."

                "BBC News | Themes | Goodbyes\nThe BBC's Richard Anthony Baker remembers Frank Sinatra\nRiding into the sunlight\nLinda McCartney became a renowned photographer and animal rights activist\nThe death of Linda McCartney also received widespread coverage and the tributes were warm and unstinting in praise of her courage in the face of the cancer which killed her at 56.\nHer husband, former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney,  memorably described how - in her final moments - he told her to imagine the two of them riding on horseback through sunlit bluebell woods.\nIf Lady Linda became best known through her husband, then the reverse was true of Sonny Bono , who died in a skiing accident in January, bringing to an end a career which started in music with his wife Cher and ended in politics, in the US Congress.\nAlmost up with Ol' Blue Eyes in legendary status was the 'First Lady of Country', Tammy Wynette , who died after a long history of health problems at the age of 55.\nSilver screen now dulled\nIf the title 'First Lady of the Jungle' had been available in the 1930s, then there was no doubt that it would have belonged to Maureen O'Sullivan , who played Jane to Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan - the role for which she will always be remembered despite starring in films as diverse as Anna Karenina and A Day At The Races.\nThe King of the Cowboys rode off into the sunset\nAmong other film greats to pass away in 1998 were King of the Cowboys Roy Rogers and the Singing Cowboy, Gene Autry .\nOn the other side of the camera, film enthusiasts all over the world mourned Japan's Akira Kurosawa .\nHe was the director responsible for masterpieces such as Rashomon, the Seven Samurai - the model for the Magnificent Seven - Ran and Kagemusha.\nThe man who created Batman and worked as a consultant on the recent films, Bob Kane , died aged 83 in November.\nFinal chords\nAs well as Frank Sinatra and Sonny Bono, the world of music lost names such as jazz musician Benny Green and classical composers Alfred Schnittke and Sir Michael Tippett .\nThe last-named was one of the finest musicians in the United Kingdom and 1998 seemed to hit hard the ranks of entertainers from the British Isles.\nWidely differing in their music but also among those who played their final tunes were popular singer Dorothy Squires , aged 83, and rock drummer Cozy Powell , whose death in a car crash was unfortunately heard by his girlfriend as he spoke to her on her mobile phone.\nComic talent\nAmong those no longer with us are the very English comedians, satirists and all-round wits Frank Muir , a veteran of TV's Call My Bluff, and John Wells , the writer of Private Eye's \"Dear Bill\" letters - supposedly from Mrs Thatcher's husband, Denis.\nBritish comedy also lost writer Johnny Speight who created the TV series Till Death Us Do Part and its notoriously bigoted main character, Alf Garnett. One of the programme's actresses, comedy veteran Patricia Hayes , also parted company with the world, as did comedienne Betty Marsden , star of radio's Round the Horne.\n'Father Ted' Dermot Morgan died suddenly at 45\nWell-loved in the UK although from the Irish Republic was Father Ted star Dermot Morgan who died in March aged 45, at the peak of his career.\nRemembering Dermot Morgan\nThe BBC's Leo Enright on the untimely death of the 'Father Ted' star\nMore serious members of the British acting profession to make their final exit in 1998 included post-war screen and stage idol Michael Denison ; Joan Hickson , TV's quintessential Miss Marple, Agatha Christie's elderly female detective; and playwright Francis Durbridge , creator of detectives such as Paul Temple.\nAnd if all the above could have been gathered together for a single show, then there is no doubt who would have been the producer - Lord Grade , the TV, film and theatrical impresario who died in November at the age of 91.\nA poetic legacy\nIn the field of literature, the name of Ted Hughes stands out. The Poet Laureate died at the end of October, aged 68, and went to his grave to the sound of his own poems read by Nobel literature prize-winner Seamus Heaney.\nThe poetic legacy of Ted Hughes\nThe BBC's Nick Higham on the death of poet laureate Ted Hughes\nLess acclaimed by the critics, perhaps, but not by the adoring general reading public was Catherine Cookson , famous for her romantic novels set in her native north-east England. Coming from the type of humble beginnings characteristic of many of her heroines, she sold more than 100 million books.\nShepard was the first American in space\nAnother who achieved the highest status in their chosen profession was astronaut Alan Shepard .\nHe was the first American in space and the fifth man to walk on the moon.\nNewspaper legends\nBritish newspapers lost three giants of their industry in 1998.\nIn May, the Mirror Group's Hugh Cudlipp , described as \"the greatest exponent of the tabloid art\", died aged 84. He had set the standard with the left-wing Sunday and Daily Mirror in the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe following month saw the death of Associated Newspapers' Sir David English , who turned the Daily Mail into the top middle-class, centre-right paper of recent years. Known as a perfectionist, he was a legend to those who worked for him.\nLess than three months later, Sir David was followed by his long-time proprietor, Lord Rothermere , one of the last great British press barons.\nOne of the BBC's own radio pioneers, Frank Gillard , a veteran war correspondent and later senior executive, died in October.\nA brief, bright star\nFlorence Griffith-Joyner's death came as a shock to the athletic world\nAmong those on the roll from the world of sport who died in 1998, the name of Florence Griffith-Joyner reigns supreme.\nA triple gold-medal winner at the 1988 Olympics, Flo-Jo as she was known, was as famous for her vivid racing outfits and fluorescent fingernails as for her speed.\nRumours of drug-taking, fuelled by her sudden retirement after Seoul, resurfaced at her death - though this was found to have been caused by an epileptic seizure and subsequent suffocation .\nAs dominant in her own sport in her own time was Helen Wills Moody , a winner of eight Wimbledon titles as well as seven in the US and four in France in the 1920s and 30s.\nSportsmen who would no longer grace their art included former Yorkshire and England wicket-keeper David Bairstow and Justin Fashanu , the first professional football player in the UK to admit being a homosexual. Both committed suicide - Fashanu because he believed he faced prosecution in the US on charges of sexually assaulting a teenage boy.\nFew tears shed\nAway from the spheres of entertainment, media and sport, a number of important politicians and business people breathed their last.\nHeld by his own troops, Pol Pot died in a jungle camp\nOf these, the name of Pol Pot ranks alone in infamy. He will be remembered as the man who turned Cambodia into the killing fields , a dictator responsible for the deaths of millions of his countrymen and unrepentant to the end.\nAnother leader of his country who will not be remembered with universal fondness is Nigeria's General Sani Abacha , who died unexpectedly of a heart attack at the age of 54. His death led to hopes that Nigeria would return to democratic rule .\n'A nation in agony'\nThe BBC's Hilary Andersson on Nigeria after the death of Moshood Abiola\nOne consequence of this would have been the release of the jailed opposition leader, Chief Moshood Abiola , but a heart attack one day before his freedom would have been realised put an end to that prospect. His funeral sparked chaotic scenes but fears that the death was not natural proved unfounded .\nOther former leaders of their countries to pass away included Constantine Karamanlis , who was president as Greece restored democracy in 1974, and Todor Zhivkov , who ruled communist Bulgaria for 35 years until 1989.\nOne potential future leader was Russia's Galina Starovoitova , murdered for her reformist views. She was much-mourned by people who had pinned their hopes on her determination to stamp out the courruption endemic in their country.\nControversial figures\nThe US saw the deaths of several historically important political figures. One was James Earl Ray , jailed for killing black civil rights leader Martin Luther King in 1968. He died still protesting his innocence and with a number of questions still hanging over his conviction.\nWallace stood for segregation - but changed his stance late in life\nInextricably linked to the issue of civil rights in America was George Wallace , who declared on becoming Democrat governor of Alabama in 1963: \"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\"\nHe was shot in 1972 and failed in several attempts to run for office. He later recanted and apologised to blacks for his earlier policies.\nA segregationist who turned to racial harmony\nThe BBC's Rageh Omaar reports on Governor George Wallace\nThe Republican side lost Barry Goldwater , who was seen as the father of modern American conservatism . Although trounced by Lyndon Johnson in the 1963 presidential campaign, his views were widely believed to have paved the way for the Reagan years in the 1980s.\nRivers of blood\nPowell provoked outrage, but was a key figure on the Tory right\nThe UK too lost a similarly controversial figure from the right, who is also best known for his views on race. Enoch Powell died, aged 85, in February.\nHis \"Rivers of Blood\" speech on immigration in 1968 led to his sacking from the shadow cabinet and ultimately to his resignation from the Conservative Party.\nBut his influence never evaporated completely and Baroness Thatcher was one of many politicians to pay tribute on Mr Powell's death, describing his speeches as \" an unforgettable experience \".\nOther British politicians who died in 1998 included the country's first minister for sport, Labour's Denis Howell , long-time Labour MP and former minister Joan Lestor and the party's veteran peer and radical Methodist campaigner Lord Soper .\nFrom the other side of the political divide, Tory euro-sceptic Nicholas Budgen passed away.\nThe British business community is no longer the domain of Tiny Rowland , a buccaneer who made his millions in the mines of Africa. Also connected with mining was Sir Ian MacGregor , the chairman of the UK National Coal Board during the miners' strike of 1984-85.\nMore stylishly, 1998 saw the last trip of Ferdinand Porsche , creator of the famous marque.\nA lasting influence\nMcDonald's fast-food restaurant chain spread globally\nBut if you look among the ranks of those who died in 1998 for the person who had the most influence on the 20th century and for a name that will live on,  perhaps you should look no further than an American man who died in July, aged 89.\nAlong with his late brother Maurice, Richard McDonald founded the ubiquitous fast-food restaurants which carry their name all over the world and will continue to do so into the next millennium.",

                "Purchasing power parity: Return of the Mac | The Economist\nReturn of the Mac\nTweet\nFOR more than 25 years, The Economist has been producing Big Mac indexes. At last, this burgernomics thing seems to be catching on. In a new paper , Orley Ashenfelter and Stepan Jurajda take the economic potential of the McDonald's menu a step further, adding to the mix wage data from stores around the world. This week's Free exchange column explores their results. First, a word about the economics underlying their analysis.\nTheir work, like The Economist's Big Mac index, grapples with the tricky business of international price and wage comparisons. At its heart is the theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP). Economists reckon the price of a good should not vary much across efficient markets. Otherwise people would buy in cheap markets and sell in dear ones until prices equalised. PPP generalises this “law of one price”. Over the long run, it suggests, exchange rates should adjust so a basket of goods costs the same in different countries. If that basket is whimsically taken to contain only a Big Mac, then burger prices may be used for back-of-the-napkin currency valuations. In January a Swiss Big Mac cost $6.81, compared with $4.20 in America and just $2.44 in China, hinting at an overvalued franc relative to the dollar and an undervalued yuan.\nEconomists use PPP to provide better comparisons of welfare across countries than can be gleaned from simply converting wages at market exchange rates. Exchange rates should adjust so that workers making traded goods are paid according to their productivity. But firms that sell non-traded goods and services must compete with firms in the tradable-goods sector for labour. So a country with high-productivity exporting firms will have high wages across all sectors—including those, like hair-cutting, where productivity differences between rich and poor countries are small. As a result, the cost of living is higher in rich countries, and simple exchange-rate adjustments overstate real welfare differences. On an exchange-rate basis, the average American is 35 times richer than the average Indian. On a PPP basis, however, taking account of the lower cost of living in India, American income is just 13 times higher.\nMssrs Ashenfelter and Jurajda collect wage data from McDonald's stores in over 60 countries (McWages). Adjusting those wages for exchange rates provides an excellent comparison of the cost of hiring the labour needed to do simple, well-defined tasks. Then take those McWages and divide by the local price of a Big Mac and you have a surprisingly simple yet powerful measure of PPP-adjusted wages.\nWage (and, therefore, productivity) gaps between rich and emerging economies remain large, but the welfare gaps, as measured by the PPP-adjusted \"Big Macs per hour\" measure, are a bit narrower. And getting narrower still, in part because of rich-world stagnation:\nBetween 2000 and 2007 America's McWage rose by 13% while the Big Mac price jumped by 21%, resulting in a net tumble in the BMPH real wage of 7% (see chart, right panel). Meanwhile, the BRICs advanced as McWages grew faster than Big Mac prices. The BMPH jumped by 53% in India, 60% in China and 152% in a Russian economy recovering from financial crisis in 1998. The going has been slower since then. Russia and China managed gains from 2007 to 2011. Most others did not, as food prices rose faster than McWages. Data gathered this summer for the 2012 calculations may show a further slowdown. Bad news for an emerging world still hungry for better living standards.\nOne can derive an awful lot of insight from a burger.",
                "Purchasing Power Parity\nPurchasing Power Parity\nWhat is Purchasing Power Parity?\n \nPurchasing power parity (PPP) is a theory which states that     exchange rates between currencies are in equilibrium when their     purchasing power is the same in each of the two countries. This     means that the exchange rate between two countries should equal     the ratio of the two countries' price level of a fixed basket of     goods and services. When a country's domestic price level is     increasing (i.e., a country experiences inflation), that country's     exchange rate must depreciated in order to return to PPP.\nThe basis for PPP is the \"law of one price\".  In the absence of     transportation and other transaction costs, competitive markets     will equalize the price of an identical good in two countries when     the prices are expressed in the same currency. For example, a     particular TV set that sells for 750 Canadian Dollars [CAD] in     Vancouver should cost 500 US Dollars [USD] in Seattle when the     exchange rate between Canada and the US is 1.50 CAD/USD. If the     price of the TV in Vancouver was only 700 CAD, consumers in     Seattle would prefer buying the TV set in Vancouver. If this     process (called \"arbitrage\") is carried out at a large scale, the     US consumers buying Canadian goods will bid up the value of the     Canadian Dollar, thus making Canadian goods more costly to     them. This process continues until the goods have again the same     price. There are three caveats with this law of one price. (1) As     mentioned above, transportation costs, barriers to trade, and     other transaction costs, can be significant. (2) There must be     competitive markets for the goods and services in both     countries. (3) The law of one price only applies to tradeable goods; immobile goods such as houses, and many services that are     local, are of course not traded between countries.\nEconomists use two versions of Purchasing Power Parity: absolute     PPP and relative PPP. Absolute PPP was described in the previous     paragraph; it refers to the equalization of price levels across     countries. Put formally, the exchange rate between Canada and the     United States ECAD/USD is equal to the price level in     Canada PCAN divided by the price level in the United     States PUSA.  Assume that the price level ratio     PCAD/PUSD implies a PPP exchange rate of 1.3     CAD per 1 USD. If today's exchange rate ECAD/USD is 1.5     CAD per 1 USD, PPP theory implies that the CAD will appreciate     (get stronger) against the USD, and the USD will in turn     depreciate (get weaker) against the CAD.\nRelative PPP refers to rates of changes of price levels,     that is, inflation rates. This proposition states that the rate of     appreciation of a currency is equal to the difference in inflation     rates between the foreign and the home country. For example, if Canada     has an inflation rate of 1% and the US has an inflation rate of 3%,     the US Dollar will depreciate against the Canadian Dollar by 2% per     year.  This proposition holds well empirically especially when the     inflation differences are large.\n \nDoes PPP determine exchange rates in the short term?\n \nNo. Exchange rate movements in the short term are news-driven.     Announcements about interest rate changes, changes in perception     of the growth path of economies and the like are all factors that     drive exchange rates in the short run. PPP, by comparison,     describes the long run behaviour of exchange rates. The economic     forces behind PPP will eventually equalize the purchasing power of     currencies. This can take many years, however. A time horizon of     4-10 years would be typical.\n \nHow is PPP calculated?\n \nThe simplest way to calculate purchasing power parity between two     countries is to compare the price of a \"standard\" good that is in     fact identical across countries. Every year The Economist magazine publishes a light-hearted version of PPP: its \"Hamburger     Index\" that compares the price of a McDonald's hamburger around     the world.  More sophisticated versions of PPP look at a large     number of goods and services. One of the key problems is that     people in different countries consumer very different sets of     goods and services, making it difficult to compare the purchasing     power between countries.\n \nAccording to PPP, by how much are currencies overvalued or undervalued?\n \nThe following two charts compare the PPP of a currency      with its actual exchange rate relative to the US Dollar and relative     to the Canadian Dollar, respectively. The charts are updated periodically to     reflect the current exchange rate. It is also updated once     a year to reflect new estimates of PPP. The PPP estimates are     taken from studies carried out by the Organization      of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and others; however,     they should not be taken as \"definitive\". Different methods of     calculation will arrive at different PPP rates.\nThe currencies listed below are compared to the US     Dollar. A green bar indicated that the local currency is overvalued by     the percentage figure shown on the axis; the currency is thus expected     to depreciate against the US Dollar in the long run. A red bar     indicates undervaluation of the local currency; the currency is thus     expected to appreciate against the US Dollar in the long run.\nThe currencies listed below are compared to the Canadian     Dollar. A green bar indicated that the local currency is overvalued by     the percentage figure shown on the axis; the currency is thus expected     to depreciate against the Canadian Dollar in the long run. A red bar     indicates undervaluation of the local currency; the currency is thus     expected to appreciate against the Canadian Dollar in the long run.\nThe currencies listed below are compared to the European Euro.     A green bar indicated that the local currency is overvalued by     the percentage figure shown on the axis; the currency is thus expected     to depreciate against the Euro in the long run. A red bar     indicates undervaluation of the local currency; the currency is thus     expected to appreciate against the Euro in the long run.\n \nWhere can I get more information?\n \n• OECD     National Accounts : The OECD publishes PPPs for all OECD     countries .

                "Purchasing Power Parity: Definition, How It's Used\nBy Kimberly Amadeo\nUpdated December 28, 2016\nDefinition: Purchasing power parity (PPP) is an economic theory that states residents of one country should be able to buy the goods and services at the same price as inhabitants of any other nation over time.\nWhy do economists say that?   International trade allows people to shop around for the best price . Given enough time, everyone's purchasing power will become equal, or reach parity. PPP depends on the law of one price.\nThat states that once the difference in exchange rates is accounted for, then everything would cost the same. (Source: Journal of Economic Literature, Kenneth Rogoff, Purchasing Power Parity Puzzle , June 1996)\nThat's not true in the real world on a day-to-day basis. That's because of differences in  transportation costs , taxes, and tariffs . Some things, such as land and services (like haircuts), can't be shipped. Not everyone throughout the world has the same access to international trade. For example, someone in rural China can't choose between every good and service throughout the world. Perhaps one day Amazon.com and other online retailers will enable real purchasing power parity.\nPPP Calculation\nPurchasing power parity is a calculation that determines how much things would cost if parity did exist. It takes into account the impact of exchange rates . It describes what each item purchased in a country would cost if it were sold in the United States.\nThese are then added up for all the final goods and services produced in that country for that given year.\nParity is tedious to compute. A U.S. dollar value  must be assigned to everything. That includes items not widely available in America. For example, there aren't too many ox-carts in the United States.\nWould its U.S. price accurately describe its value in rural Vietnam, where it's needed to grow rice?What is the U.S. price equivalent of a haircut in a country where family members give it?\nFor many developing countries , the PPP is estimated using just a multiple of the official exchange rate (OER) measure. For developed countries , the OER and PPP measures of GDP are more similar, since their standards of living are closer to the United States.\nHow It's Used\nPurchasing power parity is used in many situations. The most common method is to adjust for the price differences between countries. For example, China produced $10.98 trillion in goods and services in 2015. The U.S. produced $17.95 trillion. But you cannot compare the two without taking into account the fact that the cost of living  in China is much lower than in the United States.\nFor example, a McDonald's Big Mac costs $5.04. In China, you can get the same thing for only $2.79. People in China don't need as much income because it costs less to live.\n(For more fun comparisons, see The Economist's Big Mac Index )\nThat's because China artificially sets the value of its currency to be lower than the U.S. dollar . It intentionally wants its cost of living to be lower, so it can pay its workers less. As a result, its exports cost less, making it more competitive on the global market. For more, see Currency Wars .\nPurchasing power parity solves the problem of comparing countries with different standards of living. It recalculates the value of a country's goods and services as if they were being sold at U.S. prices. Under PPP, a Chinese Big Mac costs $5.04, the same as it does in the United States. As a result, China's GDP  under PPP is $19.39 trillion. That makes it the world's largest economy , ahead of the European Union and the United States. That's why the CIA provides GDP estimates on both an official exchange rate and a purchasing power parity basis.\nWithout purchasing power parity, China's GDP per capita would only be around $6,475. That's lower than the standard of living in Ukraine, Algeria or Kosovo. With PPP, each of the 1.3 trillion people receives (on average) the benefit of $14,100 in economic production. That's better, but still only on the level of Libya and worse than Iraq. It's far less than the U.S. GDP per capita of $55,800. That's because the United States divides its GDP among only 319 million people. (Source: CIA Factbook )\nAlthough this doesn't happen often, PPP is also used to set the exchange rate for new countries . It is used to forecast future real exchange rates. \nContinue Reading",
                "What is the Big Mac Index?\nWhat is the Big Mac Index?\nSearch the site\nWhat is the Big Mac Index?\nMcDonald's as a Purchasing Power Parity Index\nBy Justin Kuepper\nUpdated June 22, 2016\nThe Big Mac Index is an index created by The Economist based on the theory of purchasing power parity (PPP). Over the long-term, the PPP theory states that currency exchange rates should equal the price of a basket of goods and services in different countries. And, what better basket of goods than McDonald's Big Mac - or at least its equivalent - in various countries?\nIn theory, the price of a Big Mac reflects a number of local economic factors, ranging from the cost of the ingredients to the cost of local production and advertising.\nThe resulting PPP metric is therefore considered by many economists to be a reasonable measurement of real world purchasing power. But investors should remember that there are some exceptions to the rule.\nIn this article, we will take a look at how the Big Mac Index works, some drawbacks to consider, and how investors and economists can use it to draw actionable conclusions.\nHow the Big Mac Index Works\nThe Big Mac Index is calculated by dividing the price of a Big Mac in one country by the price of a Big Mac in another country in their respective local currencies. The resulting value is then compared to the official exchange rate between the two currencies to determine if either currency is undervalued or overvalued according to the PPP theory.\nFor example, suppose that a Big Mac in the U.S. costs one U.S. dollar and one in the eurozone costs two euros. The Big Mac Index valuation for EUR/USD would be 2.0, or two divided by one, which could then be compared to the EUR/USD exchange rate.\nIf the exchange rate was 1.5, investors could predict that the euro was undervalued by 0.5 euros per U.S. dollar.\nThere are also many variants of the Big Mac Index that may be useful for investors. For instance, UBS Wealth Management expanded the index to include the number of hours that an average worker must work to earn enough to buy a Big Mac.\nOther groups created separate indexes for everything from Apple iPods to Starbucks coffees to Ikea Billy bookshelves.\nThe Consumer Price Index - a key measure of inflation - seeks to include all kinds of goods, but many of these economists believe that certain goods could provide a more accurate indicator. Of course, this is also the biggest downside associated with the Big Mac Index - it only includes a single item and lacks of the diversification seen in other economic indicators.\nUsing the Big Mac Index\nInvestors in the United States may not see much need for the Big Mac Index, since there are already a number of reputable price indexes available, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). But the index becomes useful in other countries where reliable indexes aren't available, such as those that manipulate government statistics or those that don't publish official data.\nFor example, many economists believed that Argentina had been modifying its official consumer price data to understate its true rate of inflation between 2010 and 2012.\nSo, The Economist used its Big Mac Index to find that the average annual rate of burger inflation was 19% compared to the country's official 10% rate of inflation in January of 2011.\nInvestors can use data from the Big Mac Index in many different ways. For instance, they can use the values to determine if a currency is overvalued or undervalued relative to others and trade based on that data in the foreign exchange market . Similarly, investors can measure changes in values over time to determine rates of inflation and compare that to official records.\nKey Takeaway Points\nThe Big Mac Index is an index created by The Economist based on the theory of purchasing power parity (PPP).\nThe Big Mac Index is calculated by dividing the price of a Big Mac in one country by the price of a Big Mac in another country in their respective local currencies.\nInvestors can use data from the Big Mac Index in many different ways, ranging from determining rates of inflation to comparing currency valuations.\nContinue Reading",
                "Purchasing Power Parity: Weights Matter - Back to Basics: Finance & Development\nPurchasing Power Parity: Weights Matter\nFinance & Development\nThe  rate  at which the currency of one country would have  to  be converted into that of another country to buy the same amount  of  goods and services in each country\nIndex this (photo: Alexander Becher/dpa/Corbis)\nHow fast is the global economy growing? Is China contributing more to global growth than the United States? Where is the average person better off? These types of questions are of great interest to economists and others, and at first blush it appears reasonable to assume that each has a clear-cut answer. But, as with many things in economics, the reality is different.\nTo answer the questions, one must compare the value of the output from different countries. But each country reports its data in its own currency. That means that to compare the data, each country’s statistics must be converted into a common currency. However, there are several ways to do that conversion and each can give a markedly different answer.\nTwo different yardsticks\nInternational financial institutions produce a wide range of regional and global statistics. The IMF, one of these institutions, publishes many of its statistics—such as the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, and current account balances—twice a year in its World Economic Outlook (WEO). These statistics combine, or aggregate, the results from many countries into an average. The importance, or weight, of an individual country’s data in the overall result depends on the size of its economy relative to the others being compared. To derive these weights, one converts the GDP of a country in terms of its national currency into a common currency (in practice, the U.S. dollar).\nOne of the two main methods of conversion uses market exchange rates—the rate prevailing in the foreign exchange market (using either the rate at the end of the period or an average over the period). The other approach uses the purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate—the rate at which the currency of one country would have to be converted into that of another country to buy the same amount of goods and services in each country.\nTo understand PPP, let’s take a commonly used example, the price of a hamburger. If a hamburger is selling in London for £2 and in New York for $4, this would imply a PPP exchange rate of 1 pound to 2 U.S. dollars. This PPP exchange rate may well be different from that prevailing in financial markets (so that the actual dollar cost of a hamburger in London may be either more or less than the $4 it sells for in New York). This type of cross-country comparison is the basis for the well-known “Big Mac” index, which is published by the Economist magazine and calculates PPP exchange rates based on the McDonald’s sandwich that sells in nearly identical form in many countries around the world.\nOf course, any meaningful comparison of prices across countries must consider a wide range of goods and services. This is not an easy task, because of the amount of data that must be collected and the complexities in the comparison process. To facilitate price comparisons across countries, the International Comparisons Program (ICP) was established by the United Nations and the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. PPPs generated by the ICP are based on a global survey of prices. For the 2003–06 round, each of the participating countries (about 147) provided national average prices for 1,000 closely specified products.\nPPP versus market rates\nSo which method is better? The appropriate way to aggregate economic data across countries depends on the issue being considered. Market exchange rates are the logical choice when financial flows are involved. For example, the current account balance—which measures the funds coming into and going out of a country—represents a flow of financial resources across countries. It is appropriate to use the market exchange rate to convert these flows into dollars when aggregating across regions or calculating the global current account discrepancy. But for other variables, the decision is less clear cut. Take real GDP growth. International organizations use different approaches. The World Bank uses market-based rates to determine the weights in its regional and global aggregations of real GDP, whereas the IMF and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development use weights based on PPP rates (although the IMF also publishes a global growth aggregate based on market rates in the WEO). Each methodology has its advantages and disadvantages.\nAdvantages of PPP: A main one is that PPP exchange rates are relatively stable over time. By contrast, market rates are more volatile, and using them could produce quite large swings in aggregate measures of growth even when growth rates in individual countries are stable. Another drawback of market-based rates is that they are relevant only for internationally traded goods. Nontraded goods and services tend to be cheaper in low-income than in high-income countries. A haircut in New York is more expensive than in Lima; the price of a taxi ride of the same distance is higher in Paris than in Tunis; and a ticket to a cricket game costs more in London than in Lahore. Indeed, because wages tend to be lower in poorer countries, and services are often relatively labor intensive, the price of a haircut in Lima is likely to be cheaper than in New York even when the cost of making tradable goods, such as machinery, is the same in both countries. Any analysis that fails to take into account these differences in the prices of nontraded goods across countries will underestimate the purchasing power of consumers in emerging market and developing countries and, consequently, their overall welfare. For this reason, PPP is generally regarded as a better measure of overall well-being.\nDrawbacks of PPP: The biggest one is that PPP is harder to measure than market-based rates. The ICP is a huge statistical undertaking, and new price comparisons are available only at infrequent intervals. Methodological questions have also been raised about earlier surveys. Between survey dates, the PPP rates must be estimated, which can introduce inaccuracies into the measurement. Also, the ICP does not cover all countries, which means that data for missing countries must be estimated.\nDoes it make a difference?\nIt depends. There is a large gap between market- and PPP-based rates in emerging market and developing countries, for most of which the ratio of the market and PPP U.S. dollar exchange rate is between 2 and 4. But for advanced economies, the market and PPP rates tend to be much closer. As a result, developing countries get a much higher weight in aggregations that use PPP exchange rates than they do using market exchange rates. The weights of China and India in the world economy are far greater using PPP exchange rates than market-based weights.\nThus, the choice of weights makes a big difference in calculations of global growth, but little difference to estimates of aggregate growth in advanced economies. The per capita income gap between the richest and poorest countries is modestly reduced under PPP exchange rates (although it remains exceptionally large), and some countries jump up or down the income scale depending on the exchange rate conversion used.\nTim Callen is an Assistant Director in the IMF’s External Relations Department.\nUpdated:                                March 28, 2012",
                "Purchasing Power Parity\nPurchasing Power Parity\nThis material was originally created for Starting Point: Teaching Economics\nand is replicated here as part of the SERC Pedagogic Service.\nSummary\nIn this case, students learn how, over a long period of time, the nominal value of a currency is related to the ratio of prices at home and abroad. They will search for a nominal exchange rate (e.g. the Japanese yen / U.S. dollar exchange rate), the consumer price levels in the domestic (the U.S. in this example) and in the foreign country (Japan in this example) and compute the ratio between the price levels. Students will plot this ratio as an approximation of the purchasing power parity (PPP) and identify periods when it does, and does not, inform the evolution of nominal exchange rates.\nThrough peer instruction, students will address each of the following issues:\n1. Why does the purchasing power parity (PPP) increase or decrease over time?\n2. When does the purchasing power parity (PPP) inform the value of a currency better: in the short run or in the long run?\n3. What factors, besides price levels, influence the value of a currency?\nLearning Goals\nAfter the completion of this module students will be able to:\n1. Use FRED graphs to perform data manipulations.\n2. Use FRED graphs to perform a visual data comparison\n3. Test how the purchasing power parity theory fits the actual data.\n4. Understand the difference between the short-run and the long-run.\nContext for Use\nIdeally this module should be directed to an international or financial economics class; if the course syllabus has room for it, the data plotting can be used in an economics principles course as well. It can be used as an applied exercise included in a large lecture or student groups can be assigned to replicate it outside of class as a basis for a short assignment. Between the presentation of the data and the ensuing discussion, instructors should allocate 20-30 minutes of classroom time. The discussion could focus on the underlying assumptions of the purchasing power parity principle and on what factors may undermine it.\nNote that a more advanced treatment of this topic may compute the purchasing power parity both in absolute and in relative terms, experiment by changing the base period for the price indexes, and explore different data frequencies (e.g. quarterly, semiannual, or annual). These exercises may be used to illustrate how the choices made regarding data can either support or undermine a theoretical construct.\nPrerequisite skills: Graph literacy\nPrerequisite concepts: Nominal exchange rates; Law of One Price; Consumer price index\nDescription and Teaching Materials\nWithin a lecture discussing long-term determinants of exchange rates, an instructor will use this module to help students understand the computation of the purchasing power parity and to guide a discussion of its applicability.\n(Step 1)\nThe instructor will first present a graph of a nominal exchange rate (Category: Money, Banking & Finance > Exchange Rates > By Country > [Select one]) For example, Japan (DEXJPUS).\nThe instructor should point out that foreign exchange is traded on a daily (five business days a week) basis and that exchange rates can be plotted with a high level of frequency. This fact will become relevant when introducing the price indexes.\nThe instructor can ask students to identify periods when the exchange rate is increasing or decreasing in order to practice the concept of currency appreciation and depreciation. Questions of volatility can also be brought up by pointing out sudden and large changes in the value of the exchange rate.\n(Step 2)\nStarting from scratch, the instructor should then present the graphs for the price levels at home and abroad. Both consumer and producer price indexes are available for many countries. In this example we will use the consumer price index (Category: International Data > Indicators > Prices > Consumer Price Index). Make sure to first select the U.S. (CPIAUCSL) and then Add Data Series to New Line in the graph the series for the Japanese consumer price index (JPNCPIALLMINMEI).\nThe instructor should point out that the price indexes are computed once a month, much less frequently than the foreign exchange rate.\nNotes:\n- The instructor should Copy to All Lines the shortest data range (usually for the foreign country) to facilitate the interpretation of the graph.\n- The base period should be the same for both countries: Units > Index (Scale equal to 100 for chosen period) > (the international series use 2005 as the base year)\nStudents will find that the cost of living at home and abroad is different both in levels and in rates of growth. Recalling the concept of the Law of One Price the instructor could check the student understanding of this concept by asking for the expected direction of change of the exchange rate.\n(Step 3)\nThe instructor will combine the exchange rate and price information in one graph.\nFirst, we compute the purchasing power parity between the two currencies. Starting with the graph of the price levels described above, the instructor will Remove Line 2 (the price level abroad) and then Add Data Series to Line 1 (the price level abroad) in order to Create Your Own Data Transformation: b/a (price level abroad / price level in the U.S.)\nNote:\nThe definition of the exchange rate determines how the purchasing power parity is computed. The FRED database reports exchange rates as the number of units of foreign currency per US dollar. Thus, the purchasing power parity must be computed as price level abroad over the price level in the U.S. A class discussion question could be how to compute the purchasing power parity when the exchange rate is reported as the number of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency.\n(Step 4)\nFinally, the instructor will add to the graph above the plot of the exchange rate series: Add Data Series to New Line, selecting Scale > Right.\nThe following is a list of questions that could be asked:\nAre the purchasing power parity and the nominal interest rate ever/frequently identical? Should we expect them to be identical?\nWhich series is more volatile, the purchasing power parity or the nominal interest rate? What could explain the difference in volatility?\nAre there years when the purchasing power parity theory points to a currency appreciation (depreciation) while the actual nominal interest rate moves in the opposite direction? What could explain this divergence?\nWhen does the purchasing power parity theory work best at explaining the evolution of the nominal exchange rate: in the short run or in the long run?\nFurther sophistication:\nUse the producer price index instead of the consumer price index for the computation of the purchasing power parity and compare the plots.\nChange the frequency of the nominal exchange rate data from daily to monthly, quarterly, semiannual... and compare the plots.\nTeaching Notes and Tips\nBe sure to present the argument about how the Law of One Price should make the nominal exchange rate equal to the ratio of prices at home and abroad. A commonly referenced example on this topic is the Big Mac Index. The Economist computes this index annually and has created an interactive web page: http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index\nAn instructor may want to explore the fact that the computation of the purchasing power parity is influenced by the choice of prices, or price indexes, one employs. Furthermore, even when employing identically named price indexes across countries the composition of the basket of goods and services changes from country to country. The Division of International Labor Comparisons of the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a report on international indexes of consumer prices:\nhttp://www.bls.gov/fls/intl_consumer_prices.pdf\nFrom this activity to the computation of the real exchange rate only a small step is needed. The following resource should help the instructor make that connection. It would be advisable not to try and discuss the purchasing power parity theory and real exchange rates during the same class period. The Back to Basics series by the International Monetary Fund has an issue entitled \"Why Real Exchange Rates\":\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2007/09/pdf/basics.pdf\nAssessment\nThe recommended method for assessment for an international or financial economics class would be to have students write up a short memo where they test the applicability of the purchasing power parity theory to the actual data. This should be a take-home assignment.\nReferences and Resources\n1. The Big Mac Index as an example of the Law of One Price:\nhttp://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index\n2.

                "What Is Purchasing Power Parity? (PPP) | Investopedia\nWhat Is Purchasing Power Parity? (PPP)\nBy Investopedia | November 2, 2016 — 12:01 PM EDT\nMacroeconomic analysis relies on several different metrics to compare economic productivity and standards of living between countries and across time. One popular metric is purchasing power parity (PPP) .\nPurchasing Power Parity (PPP) is an economic theory that compares different countries' currencies through a market \"basket of goods\" approach. According to this concept, two currencies are in equilibrium or at par when a market basket of goods (taking into account the exchange rate) is priced the same in both countries.\nThis is how the relative version of PPP is calculated:\nWhere:\n\"S\" represents exchange rate of currency 1 to currency 2\n\"P1\" represents the cost of good \"x\" in currency 1\n\"P2\" represents the cost of good \"x\" in currency 2\nTo make a comparison of prices across countries that holds any type of meaning, a wide range of goods and services must be considered. The amount of data that must be collected, and the complexity of drawing comparisons makes this process difficult. To facilitate this, the International Comparisons Program (ICP) was established in 1968 by the University of Pennsylvania and the United Nations . Purchasing power parities generated by the ICP are based on a worldwide price survey that compares the prices of hundreds of various goods. This data, in turn, helps international macroeconomists come up with estimates of global productivity and growth.\nEvery three years, the World Bank constructs and releases a report that compares various countries in terms of PPP and U.S. dollars.\nBoth the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) use weights based on PPP metrics to make predictions and recommend economic policy.\nThese actions often impact financial markets in the short run.\nSome forex traders also use PPP to find potentially overvalued or undervalued currencies. Investors who hold stock or bonds of foreign companies may survey PPP figures to predict the impact of exchange-rate fluctuations on a country's economy.\nPPP: The Alternative to Market Exchange Rates\nUsing PPPs is the alternative to using market exchange rates. The actual purchasing power of any currency is the quantity of that currency needed to buy a specified unit of a good or a basket of common goods and services. PPP is determined in each country based on its relative cost of living and inflation rates. Purchasing power plus parity ultimately means equalizing the purchasing power of two differing currencies by accounting for differences in inflation rates and cost of living.\nThe Big Max Index: An Example of PPP\nAs a light-hearted annual test of PPP, The Economist has tracked the price of McDonald's Corp.’s ( MCD ) Big Mac burger in many countries since 1986.The highly publicized Big Mac Index is used to measure the purchasing power parity (PPP) between nations, using the price of a Big Mac as the benchmark . The Big Mac index suggests that, in theory, changes in exchange rates between currencies should affect the price that consumers pay for a Big Mac in a particular nation, replacing the \"basket\" with the famous hamburger.\nFor example, if the price of a Big Mac is $4.00 in the U.S. as compared to 2.5 pounds sterling in Britain, we would expect that the exchange rate would be 1.60 (4/2.5 = 1.60). If the exchange rate of dollars to pounds is any greater, the Big Mac Index would state that the pound was overvalued, any lower and it would be under-valued.\nThat said, the index has its flaws. First, the Big Mac's price is decided by McDonald's Corp. and can significantly affect the Big Mac index. Also, the Big Mac differs across the world in size, ingredients, and availability. That being said, the index is meant to be light-hearted and is a great example of PPP that is used by many schools and universities to teach students about PPP.\nWhat is the Difference Between GDP and GDP Accounting for PPP?\nIn contemporary macroeconomics, GDP refers to the total monetary value of the goods and services produced within one country. Nominal GDP calculates the monetary value in current, absolute terms. Real GDP takes the nominal GDP and adjusts it for inflation. Further, some accounts of GDP are adjusted for relative purchasing power parity or PPP. This adjustment is based on an attempt to convert nominal GDP into a number more easily comparable between countries with different currencies.\nGDP with PPP\nOne way to think of what GDP with PPP represents is to imagine the total collective purchasing power of Japan if it were used to make the same purchases in U.S. markets. This only works after all yen are exchanged for dollars, otherwise, the comparison does not make sense. The net effect is to describe how many dollars it takes to buy $1 worth of goods in Japan as opposed to in the U.S.\nThe following micro-example can illustrate that point. Suppose it costs $10 to buy a shirt in the U.S. It costs €8.00 to buy the same shirt in Germany. To make an apples-to-apples comparison, the €8.00 in Germany needs to be converted into U.S. dollars . If the exchange rate was such that the shirt in Germany costs $15.00, the PPP would be 15/10, or 1.5. For every $1.00 spent on the shirt in the U.S., it takes $1.50 to obtain the same shirt in Germany.\nWhich Nations Have the Greatest Purchasing Power?\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the total dollar value of all goods and services produced by a country in a given year. It is one of the primary indicators used to evaluate a country's economy and can be calculated in market exchange terms and in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.\nA country's GDP at PPP takes into consideration the relative costs of local goods and services produced in a country valued at prices of the United States. It factors in exchange rates and the inflation rates of each country. Further, GDP at PPP reflects the purchasing power of a citizen in one country to a citizen of another. For example, a pair of shoes may cost less in one country than another, so purchasing power parity is needed for fairness in the calculation.\nThe five nations with the highest GDP in market exchange terms are the U.S., China, India, Japan, and Germany. This comparison changes when PPP is used. According to 2014 data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), China has overtaken the U.S. as the world's largest economy based on purchasing power with just over 16.5% of the global GDP. The U.S. comes in second with 16.5%. India, Japan, and Germany follow with 6.8%, 4.5%, and 3.4% respectively.\nThe Downfalls of PPP: Short-Term Vs. Long-Term Parity\nEmpirical evidence has shown that for many goods and baskets of goods , PPP is not observed in the short-term , and there is uncertainty over whether it applies in the long-term. In “Burgernomics,” (2003) a prominent paper that explores the Big Mac Index and PPP, authors Michael Pakko and Patricia Pollard cite several confounding factors as to why PPP theory does not line up with reality.\nThe reasons for this differentiation include:\nTransport Costs: Goods that are not available locally will need to be imported, resulting in transport costs. Imported goods will consequently sell at a relatively higher price than the same goods available from local sources.\nTaxes: When government sales taxes , such as value-added tax (VAT), are high in one country relative to another, this means goods will sell at a relatively higher price in the high-tax country.\nGovernment Intervention: Import tariffs add to the price of imported goods. Where these are used to restrict supply, demand rises, causing the price of the goods to rise as well. In countries where the same good is unrestricted and abundant, its price will be lower. Governments that restrict exports will see a good's price rise in importing countries facing a shortage , and fall in exporting countries where its supply is increasing.\nNon-Traded Services: The Big Mac's price is composed of input costs that are not traded. Therefore, those costs are unlikely to be at parity internationally. These costs can include the cost of the storefront,  and other expenses such as insurance, heating and the cost of labor .\nAccording to PPP, in countries where non-traded service costs are relatively high, goods will be relatively expensive, causing such countries' currencies to be overvalued relative to currencies in countries with low costs of non-traded services.\nMarket Competition: Goods might be deliberately priced higher in a country because the company has a competitive advantage over other sellers, either because it has a monopoly or is part of a cartel of companies that manipulate prices.\nThe company's sought-after brand might allow it to sell at a premium price as well. Conversely, it might take years of offering goods at a reduced price to establish a brand and add a premium, especially if there are cultural or political hurdles to overcome.\nInflation: The rate at which the price of goods (or baskets of goods) is changing in countries, the inflation rate, can indicate the value of those countries' currencies. Such relative PPP overcomes the need for goods to be the same when testing absolute PPP discussed above.\nTrending"

                "Swallows and Amazons is the first book in the Swallows and Amazons series by English author Arthur Ransome; it was first published in 1930, with the action taking place in the summer of 1929 in the Lake District. The book introduces central protagonists John, Susan, Titty and Roger Walker (Swallows) and their mother and baby sister, as well as Nancy and Peggy Blackett (Amazons) and their uncle Jim, commonly referred to as Captain Flint.\n\nAt the time, Ransome had been working as a journalist with the Manchester Guardian, but decided to become a full-time author rather than go abroad as a foreign correspondent. He did continue to write part-time for the press, however.\n\nThe book was inspired by a summer spent by Ransome teaching the children of his friends, the Altounyans, to sail. Three of the Altounyan children's names are adopted directly for the Walker family. Ransome and Ernest Altounyan bought two small dinghies called Swallow and Mavis. Ransome kept Swallow until he sold it a number of years later, while Mavis remained in the Altounyan family and is now on permanent display in the Ruskin Museum. However, later in life Ransome tried to downplay the Altounyan connections, changing the initial dedication of Swallows and Amazons and writing a new foreword which gave other sources.   In 2003, the novel was listed at number 57 on the BBC's survey The Big Read. \n\nIllustrations\n\nThe artist chosen for the first edition of the book was Steven Spurrier; however, Ransome objected to his style and so the first edition did not have any illustrations. Spurrier's drawing for the dust jacket had to be used. The second edition contained drawings by Clifford Webb but after Ransome successfully illustrated Peter Duck himself, he decided to do his own drawings for all the books including those already published and Webb's drawings were replaced in later editions.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe book relates the outdoor adventures and play of two families of children. These involve sailing, camping, fishing, exploration and piracy. The Walker children (John, Susan, Titty and Roger) are staying at a farm near a lake in the Lake District of England, during the school holidays. They sail a borrowed dinghy named Swallow and meet the Blackett children (Nancy and Peggy), who sail a dinghy named Amazon.  The Walkers camp on an island in the lake while the Blacketts live in their house nearby. When the children meet, they agree to join forces against a common enemy - the Blacketts' uncle James Turner whom they call \"Captain Flint\" (after the character in Treasure Island). Turner, normally an ally of his nieces, has withdrawn from their company in order to write his memoirs, and has become decidedly unfriendly. Furthermore, when the Blacketts let off a firework on his houseboat roof, it is the Walkers who get the blame. He refuses even to listen when they try to pass on a warning to him about burglars in the area.\n\nIn order to determine who should be the overall leader in their campaign against Captain Flint, the Blacketts and the Walkers have a contest to see which can capture the others' boat. As part of their strategy the Walkers make a dangerous crossing of the lake by night, and John is later cautioned by his mother for this reckless act. The Walkers nevertheless win the contest - thanks to Titty who seizes the Amazon when the Blacketts come to Wild Cat Island. During the same night Titty hears suspicious voices coming from a different island - Cormorant Island - and in the morning it transpires that Turner's houseboat has been burgled. Turner again blames the Walkers, but is finally convinced that he is mistaken and feels he was wrong to distance himself from his nieces' adventures all summer. The Swallows, Amazons and Turner investigate Cormorant Island, but they cannot find Turner's missing trunk.\n\nThe following day there is a mock battle between Turner and the children, after which Turner is tried for his crimes and forced to walk the plank on his own houseboat. They agree at the post-battle feast that on the final day of their holidays Titty and Roger will go back to Cormorant Island while the others go fishing.  Titty finds the trunk, which contains the memoirs on which Turner had been working, and is rewarded with Turner's green parrot.\n\nJames Turner appears in some ways to be modelled on Ransome himself. The story, set in August 1929, includes a good deal of everyday Lakeland life from the farmers to charcoal burners working in the woods; corned beef, which the children fancifully refer to as pemmican, and ginger beer and lemonade, which they call grog, appear as regular food stuff for the campers; island life also allows for occasional references to the story of Robinson Crusoe.\n\nMajor characters in Swallows and Amazons\n\nSee also List of characters in Arthur Ransome books\n\n*John Walker – Eldest of the Walkers and captain of the Swallow\n*Susan Walker – Second eldest of the Walkers and mate of the Swallow\n*Titty Walker – Able Seaman of the Swallow.  This name was the nickname of the real life Mavis Altounyan, from Joseph Jacobs's children's story, Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse.   It has caused titters among generations of children, causing it to be changed to Kitty in the original BBC adaptation of the book, and Tatty for a 2016 BBC Films adaptation \n*Roger Walker – Youngest of the sailing Walkers and ship's boy of the Swallow\n*Bridget Walker – (nicknamed \"Vicky\" due to a resemblance to pictures of Queen Victoria in old age, and referred to as such in the book) Youngest of the Walkers and ship's baby of the Swallow\n*Nancy Blackett (Ruth) – Captain of the Amazon\n*Peggy Blackett (Margaret) – Nancy's younger sister and mate of the Amazon\n*James Turner – Nancy and Peggy's uncle. Known to the children as \"Captain Flint\"\n\nPlaces in Swallows and Amazons\n\nAccording to Ransome, every place in his book can be found in the Lake District, but he took different locations and placed them in different ways: the lake is a fictionalised version of Windermere but the surrounding countryside more closely resembles that around Coniston.  Wild Cat Island, the location of the island camp, has elements from Peel Island in Coniston and Blake Holme (or Blakeholme) in Windermere.   Holly Howe, the farmhouse where the Swallows stay is based on Bank Ground Farm,  which exists to this day. It was featured in the 1974 film.\n\nFilm, TV, radio and theatrical adaptations\n\n1963 TV adaptation\n\nIn 1963, the BBC produced an adaptation, Swallows and Amazons, with John Paul as \"Captain Flint\" and Susan George as the renamed \"Kitty\". The series was directed by Peter Saunders. \n\n1974 film version\n\nOther versions\n\nIn August 1999 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation by David Wood  with Jean Anderson as Titty seventy years later narrating. Young Titty was played by Phoebe Phillips, John by John Paul Ekins, Susan by Flora Harris, Roger by Joe Sowerbutts, mother by Penny Downie, Nancy by Catherine Poole, Peggy by Jackie Swainson and Uncle Jim by Nicholas Le Prevost.\n\nThe Royal National Theatre started developing a musical version of Swallows and Amazons in 2007. Helen Edmundson wrote the book and lyrics while The Divine Comedy's frontman Neil Hannon wrote the music. The musical premiered at the Bristol Old Vic on 1 December 2010 and played at the Vaudeville Theatre, in London's West End, from 15 December 2011, prior to going on tour around the UK from January to May 2012.    The production features adults playing the children and has been received favourably by reviewers.  \n\nUpcoming film\n\nA British film Swallows and Amazons is scheduled for release in 2016, with director Philippa Lowthorpe.  The film features Sherlock's Andrew Scott, plus Teddie-Rose Malleson-Allen as the renamed Tatty.\n\nRelease details\n\n*1930, UK, Jonathan Cape, Pub date 1 December 1930, hardback (First edition, unillustrated)\n*1931, UK, Jonathan Cape, Pub date 1931, hardback (First \"Clifford Webb\" illustrated edition)\n*1931, US, J.B.Lippincott company, Philadelphia, 1931.

                "Tours of Scottish Islands | USA Today\nTours of Scottish Islands\nThe Shetland Isles are more than halfway between London and the Arctic Circle.\n(Photo: Hemera Technologies/AbleStock.com/Getty Images )\nRail Travel From Glasgow to Edinburgh\nScotland is a relatively small country with a total land area slightly smaller than that of Maine. A significant proportion of Scotland's total area, and a large part of the country's total coastline, is found in the many Scottish islands. From the major Scottish cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Inverness or Aberdeen, you can reach Scotland's western or northern isles by joining a group organized tour, arranging a private tour or traveling independently.\nInner Hebrides\nThe Inner Hebrides are an archipelago of islands off the west coast of Scotland, distinguished from the Outer Hebrides by their relative proximity to the Scottish mainland. Tourism is a primary commercial activity on these islands, of which only 36 are inhabited as of March 2011. Some of the larger islands include Coll, Eigg, Islay, Jura, Mull, Skye and Tiree. Organized group tours of the Inner Hebrides are offered by operators based in Oban, Glasgow and Edinburgh. If you prefer to tour independently, the Inner Hebrides can be reached by scheduled ferry from Kintyre, Oban and Mallaig. You can reach Oban by national rail from elsewhere in Scotland or the United Kingdom.\nOuter Hebrides\nThe Outer Hebrides, also referred to as the Long Island or the Western Isles, sit to the northwest of the Inner Hebrides and further from the Scottish coast. Fifteen of the islands that make up the Outer Hebrides are inhabited as of March 2011; there are approximately 50 more uninhabited islands of reasonable size. Tourism is an important source of revenue in the Outer Hebrides, as is weaving, fishing and small-scale farming. Visitors can reach the Outer Hebrides on scheduled ferry services from Oban or Ullapool on the mainland or Uig on the Inner Hebrides island of Skye. Some ferries operate only during summer months. Flights are also available between Hebridean islands, and from the Hebrides to the Scottish mainland. The Outer Hebridean island of Barra is the only airport in the world to use a beach as a runway for scheduled flights. Flight times are arranged to depart and arrive in Barra during the hours the beach runway is not underwater.\nSt. Kilda\nSt. Kilda is a group of islands some 50 miles west of the Outer Hebrides. Until 1930, a community of crofters inhabited the larger of these remote islands. As of March 2011, the village of St. Kilda is abandoned and the islands are home to massive puffin, guillemot, fulmar and gannet populations. Boat tours to St. Kilda operate from the island of Harris, taking approximately three hours to make the 50-mile journey between islands. On St. Kilda, tourists can birdwatch, explore the abandoned village and visit the permanent museum.\nOrkney and Shetland\nOrkney and Shetland are two large inhabited islands to the north of the Scottish mainland. Regular scheduled ferries and flights to Shetland and Orkney depart the northeast Scottish city of Aberdeen. You can join an organized tour to the Northern Isles from Aberdeen, or travel from Edinburgh or Glasgow via group bus and ferry. Independently, you can take a scheduled flight from Aberdeen to Shetland or Orkney with British Airways or using Atlantic Airways' summer service. Orkney and Shetland offer spectacular scenery and wildlife, many miles of coastline and heritage sites including archaeological museums and historical shipwrecks of Scapa Flow.\nReferences",

To travel with Monica Weller in poem, prose and photography is a moving and exhilarating experience. The photographs indicate a perceptive eye and add tremendously to the drama and dignity of Hirta, inspiring the reader to an inexplicable feeling of awe and appreciation of these Jewels of the Western Ocean.'\nI personally found Monica's words to be a close echo my own feelings for the Hebrides. She portrays their magnetism very well.

                "St. Kilda Archipelago, Outer Hebrides, Scotland\nMay 19, 2014 - National Geographic Explorer\nPanoramic view of the village site on Hirta Island, St. Kilda Archipelago, Scotland.\nThis small and extremely remote archipelago has been inhabited for nearly 2,000 years. Lying over 60 km west of North Uist, they form the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides. The largest of these islands, Hirta, has likely never had more than 200 inhabitants in its long history. However, the islands and volcanic stacs have been home to hundreds of thousands of nesting seabirds for millennia. With the largest population of nesting gannets at over 60,000 pairs, 139,000 pairs of puffins and Britain's largest population of fulmars, at nearly 70,000 pairs, the land air and sea literally teems with life.\n \nThe inhabitants, throughout their history, sustained themselves on the abundant bird life and rich sea life around the islands.  The practice of fowling, a risky food gathering technique on some of the highest sea cliffs in Europe, allowed the men to gather eggs and birds in a sustainable manner to provide a year-round source of food. The islanders also had an ancient form of sheep called the Soay which still roam the island of Hirta today in a feral state.\n \nWith little or no evidence in the archeological record to provide a reason for the colonization of these islands, their isolation and lengthy occupation, up until 1930 when the remaining handful of islanders were evacuated, had produced a unique culture that today only exists in a small collection of films, writings and the now protected and restored ruins of the village and its associated buildings. The islands were given to the National Trust for Scotland and declared a nature reserve in 1957, protecting both the cultural and natural history of this spectacular site.\n \nWith the forward thinking of our expedition leader and captain we altered our schedule for the expedition in order to avoid forecasted high winds which would have made landing here impossible.  Arriving a day earlier than planned, we managed to make our landing on this significant and all-too-often inaccessible site. Strolling amongst the stone structures, green fields and the wild Soay sheep, it was almost as if one could picture the hardy and resourceful inhabitants making the most of this remote island.",

                "St Kilda  Visitor Guide, Hotels, Cottages, Things to Do in Scotland\nThe End Of St Kilda\nThe story of the end of St Kilda as an inhabited island...\nFriday 29th August 1930 was the end of the life of St Kilda as it had been for centuries. For a least 1,000 years the inhabitants of this remote group of islands had been tenants of the Macleods of Dunvegan on Skye . In earlier days the trip from Skye , undertaken in longboats, would require 16 hours of rigorous rowing and sailing. Even now, the trip to St Kilda is no easy matter.\nSt Kilda consists of several islands. Hirta, the main habitable island, is now a permanent home only to the largest colony of fulmars in Britain. Across a narrow channel lies Dun. Nearby Boreray is home to the world's largest colony of gannets. Soay virtually completes the group. There are several dramatic 'stacs' rising sheer from the Atlantic Ocean. At 430 m, the sea cliffs at Conachair are the highest in the British Isles.\nUntil 1930 the islanders had been supported by the mainland by the provision of a nurse and a post office. But the Scottish Office decided that their subsidy of the islands was no longer economic. This meant that life for the residents without those facilities would be untenable. Now owned by the National trust for Scotland, St Kilda is a National Nature reserve. Each year, during the brief summer months when travel to the islands is possible, teams of volunteers work on Hirta, maintaining what remains of the abandoned houses, studying the wildlife and glorying in the peace and isolation of the place.\nBut in 1930, to the younger of the 36 residents, including a man with nine children, evacuation was an attractive prospect. There would be better schooling for the children, and better health care. Although many had never seen a tree, a new life in forestry appealed. The more elderly residents, most of whom had never left the island and who could not speak English, must have viewed the drastic change with alarm. But the younger majority view prevailed and evacuation was planned. There were five hundred Soay sheep to be moved first. Their coats of fine wool were not sheared but plucked by the inhabitants with just the help of a penknife. The resultant locally woven tweed, either shipped ashore or sold to rare visitors, had provided the inhabitants' only contact with actual money. No taxes on income or on anything else were paid. Their internal economy took the form of barter. The plentiful supply of gannets, when dried, provided winter food. No inhabitant had ever fought in any war. Their distance and isolation earned them no consideration by the rest of Scotland.\nDespite protestations by The Canine Defence League, all dogs were destroyed. Just two were put down by injections of hydrocyanic acid. The rest, at the islanders' insistence, had stones tied around their necks and were hurled from the jetty. Small boats, holding only a dozen or so sheep, were used to ferry them out to the SS Dunara Castle. Ten cows with four calves were also evacuated. Then HMS Harebell, of the Fishery Protection Service, came on the final day to take the islanders to the mainland. The Under Secretary of State for Scotland imposed a ban on photography, thus ensuring the people of St Kilda privacy during the evacuation. It was not possible to house all of the inhabitants in Argyll, as had been hoped, so the community was split, their communal lives coming to an end. The history of the island has been documented in a number of scholarly works, including The Life and Death of St Kilda by Tom Steel, and Island on the Edge of the World (Google Books), by Charles Maclean.\nThe Hebridean archives have scanned the log-book of Hirta school which provides a first hand chronicle of the final days on St Kilda.

                "The Outer Hebrides: St Kilda - Hirta - Western Isles\nWhaling Station - Bunavoneader\nSt Kilda - Western Isles - Outer Hebrides\nThis group of Hebridean islands are the most remote in the British Isles, being 40 miles from the nearest land. It can be seen from the Sounds of Harris and also from near the Isle of Pabbay which is near to the Isle of Lewis and also from Barra.\nSt Kilda - Astonishing Sea Stacks & Cliffs\nSt Kilda has astonishing cliffs and sea stacs, where there is the most important seabird breeding station in north-west Europe.\nVillage of St Kilda\nThe village , or the remains of a village, is of great historical value. You can see restored cottages, church and the school where the St Kildans resided until their evacuation in 1930.\nWhat Remains Now of St Kilda - Hirta\nWhat remains there now are the ruins of both their original houses, mainly blackhouse type houses, alongside slightly newer houses which had been built for them in the later years. The layout of the 19th-century village remains to this day, and over 1,400 stone-built Cleit for storing food and fuel are scattered all over the islands, and even on the sea stacs\nStory of the St Kildans\nIt is a fascinating story, the life of the St Kildans, a village people so remote from the mainland, who led a really simple, some would say primitive existence, only seeing other peoples very infrequently, when either their landlords, who at one time were from the Isle of Sky, sent the factor to collect their \"rents\" or indeed when various ministers and schoolteachers were sent to the island.\nOccasionally too, boats from the mainland visited and \"bought and traded\" their wares to and from the islanders. The villagers had such a hard life,  in brief, they lived and survived off just what they could obtain from the island and the smaller few islands that make up the group of St Kilda islands.\nSmallpox\nIn 1726 a St Kildan visited Harris, caught smallpox there, and died from it. His clothes were returned to St Kilda in 1727, and brought the disease with them. Most of the islanders died, only 1 adult and 18 children survived the outbreak. However, 3 men and 8 boys escaped the disease as they had been left on Stac an Armin to collect gannets. The disease spread while they were there and nobody could go to fetch them. They were eventually rescued by the Steward 9 months later. The owner of St Kilda had to send people from Harris to repopulate St Kilda.\nBefore I begin to tell you about this wonderful trip, I will just say for any others who may be thinking of doing such a trip, that we give all praise to Seatrek and the two staff members who took us out in the boat.\nThe two staff members were both brilliant and really did go the extra mile to make the trip memorable.\nAs we were so fortunate in that the weather was lovely, full beaming sun, when the visit to the St Kilda village had been completed, and we visited the awesome rock stacks with the bird colonies, the Seatrek staff arranged that we spent at least an extra hour or so than was on the schedule at the sea stacks. As we were all having such a great time, and no one had a want for the trip to end, we enjoyed the extra time.\nSo a big thank you to Sea trek staff!\nAmazing trip with Seatrek - July 2013\nVillage Street - St Kilda\nSummary of  St Kilda  Islands and the Earlier Residents\nMany of you may not have heard or read about St Kilda, to really understand what you are seeing on the island, I think you really need to have read at least a few articles on the amazing history of the islands and the past residents.\nSt Kilda - All That Remains     Above Sea After Volcano 60 million Years Ago!\nThis group of islands are all that remains above the sea of a large volcano thought to have been active 60 million years ago. The underlying rocks which are granite, gabbro and dolerite, have been eroded by ice, rain and sea to form an impressive coastline of the four main islands and offshore stacs. Stac an Armin, being 191 metres is the highest sea stac in the British Isles\n \nIn brief to summarise, St Kilda is a group of islands, though most people when quoting St Kilda, really mean the largest island where the actual village was, that called Hirta.\nHirta\nHirta was occupied for many thousands of years by various residents and there were many traditions handed down the generations, traditions influenced by monks, viking sailors, medieval rulers and landowners.\nIn later times though there were actually very few residents left and in 1930 the very last remaining villages asked the government to evacuate them to the mainland as life there was no longer sustainable. By this time there were only 30 residents left. It was a very sad occasion when they left the St Kilda village behind.\nThe Seatrek Boat\nSea Loch Seen Along the Walk\nSoay Sheep on Hirta - St Kilda\nView From a St Kilda Old House Window\nFuel\nFuel was the hardest thing to acquire for the St Kildans, whilst there was some peat on the island, it was only in a few spots and was too far away for the islanders to carry. They dried turf in special narrow houses built specially for this purpose.\nRemotest Islands in the British Isles\nThis group of islands are the most remote in the British Isles, being 40 miles from the nearest land. It can be seen from the Sounds of Harris and also from near the Isle of Pabbay which is near to the Isle of Lewis and also from Barra. St Kilda has astonishing cliffs and sea stacs, where there is the most important seabird breeding station in north-west Europe.\nWorld Heritage Site - St Kilda\nSt Kilda is a world heritage site, there are three organisations that work together to protect and care for and conserve the site. These are The National Trust for Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and the MoD, St Kilda is one of only 24 global locations which has been awarded 'mixed' World Heritage Status for its natural and cultural significance.\nHistory of St Kilda and the St Kildans\nThe history of the site and the history of the St Kildans tells a fascinating story which captures the interest and imagination of many people for many years. The way of life that the St Kildans lived, was very harsh and thee villagers had much to be proud of, though their story is at times somewhat sad. The last of the villagers was evacuated to the mainland in the 1930.\nThe Name St Kilda - Derivation\nThe name St Kilda, actually does not derive from there being a \"Saint Kilda\" The main island was called\" Hirte\" or \"Hirta\" . A a map was published in 1540 which detailed the name St Kilda, but it was given for another island near Lewis, however in 1592 it was used for the St Kilda archipelago consisting of five islands, Hirta, Soay, Boreray, Dun and Levenish. There are also two very large rocks or sea stacks Stac an Armin and Stac Lee.\nThe St Kilda Village - Great Historical Interest\nThe village , or the remains of a village, is of great historical value and you can see restored cottages, the church and the school where the St Kildan residents lived until their evacuation in 1930.ere are several species of dolphins that can be seen around the Western Isles. Exactly what kind of houses the very early St Kildans lived in isn't known for certain, however there are remains of blackhouses and early stone structures. The village as its is today, was laid out by a minister in the 1830's, a kind of half moon shaped long street of house sand their small cultivation plots of land next to each house\nMeadow Pipit Seen on Hirta - St Kilda\nWorld War 1 -  Hirta - shelled by German submarine\nEarly in World War I the Royal Navy erected a signal station on Hirta, and daily communications with the mainland were established for the first time in St Kilda's history. In a belated response, the German submarine SM U-90[88] arrived in Village Bay on the morning of 15 May 1918 and, after issuing a warning, started shelling the island.\nSeventy-two shells were fired, and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church & jetty storehouse were damaged, but no loss of life occurred. As a result of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a promontory overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw military use.\nFood - Fulmars - Gannets - Puffins\nThe main source of food was gained from the actual birds, the gannets & fulmars being the two main birds, but the St Kildans also ate puffins.      They went to amazing feats of agility to obtain the young birds, climbing the rock stacks barefoot,  carrying their spoils on their backs to the small boats which they used & back to Hirta.\nThe birds eggs provide a much needed fresh food in the summer months,  the gannets, fulmars were harvested each season to be plucked, dried & stored for the next winter.      It was around 1860 when they were visited by ornithologists who suggested to the St Kildans that there was money to be made from actually selling birds eggs, especially the fulmars of which there weren't any in Great Britain that the islanders began to do this also.\nThe feathers & oil were kept for export and helped pay their rent, the bones were shaped & used as implements and tools,  the skins were used for shoes.\nThey also grew what crops they could, barley and the like and either used the crops and like the birds these provided either food, fodder or they were traded to the mainlanders as rent or exchanged for various necessary items.\nBeing that the stacks were the highest in the UK - 400 metres in height and in some places are almost vertical, this really was a feat! I have detailed a few facts below about the Island and its people, and made this page using the photographs we took during the trip. In 1912 after a really sever winter there was a great shortage of food\n  Teachers Desk at the Schoolroom- Hirta\n4inch Mark111 QG Military Gun at St Kilda\nA Cleit on Hirta - St Kilda - Used for Storage Purposes\nGannets Nesting on The Stacs at St Kilda\nRuins in Front of the Bay at Hirta - St Kilda\nHirta - The St Kilda Church\nHighest Cliffs in the UK\nSt Kilda has the highest cliffs in the Uk, being 400 metres high, also the highest underwater cliffs which support incredible sea life. with caves and caverns an underwater spectacle. The stacs that are part of the St Kilda archipelago are incredible. The main stacs area)     Stac an Armin, Stac Lee and of course the lovely island nearby of Boreray.\nStac an Armin.\nStac an Armin is a sea stack in the St Kilda archipelago, and is 196 metres in height. It is the highest sea stack in Scotland and The British Isles.      The name Stac an Armin means stack of the soldier/warrior.\nThe St Kildans didn't actually stay on the stac, but visited to harvest the birds and their eggs and it is thought that there were occasions when because of the weather, they were forced to remain on the stac overnight until the weather cleared and the sea was calm enough to travel back to St Kilda. The St Kildans climbed barefoot or with thick socks on and used ropes made of horsehair. Stac an Armin a quarter of a mile north of Boreray and also quite near to Stac Lee\nStac Lee (Gaelic Stac Li)\nStac Lee is 172-metre-high and is home to the worlds largest colony of Northern Gannets. It is four miles North East of Hirta. Seen from the south, the rock appears as an imposing cliff as broad as high, while from the west it has the aspect of a thin needle with a top bevelled at an angle of 45°. The most impressive view is that obtained from the south-east, from where Stac Lee looks like a giant hook. This stac is also home to fulmars and kittiwakes\nBoreray\nBoreray island reaches 384metres in height. Boreray is the smallest of the Scottish islands to have a summit over one thousand feet. On Boreray there are three small bothies which the St Kildans regularly used when they did their fowling expeditions.\nWhen in 1724 there was an outbreak of smallpox, three men and eight boys were marooned on Boreray until the following May. It is said that there are 130 different flowering plants on the island. Long ago also there were a primitive variety of sheep called \"Boreray\" sheep.\nStac Lee at St Kilda - Western isles\nThe Village Street - Hirta - St Kilda\nPulpit in the St Kilda - Hirta Church\nBoreray - St Kilda - Hebrides\nThe Church Bell\nThe bell that the St Kildans used for some years had quite a story to it, a ship the SS Janet Gowan built in Quebec and registered in Greenock was wrecked on St Kilda in 1864\nOn a voyage - Calcutta to Dundee\nThe Ship had been  on a voyage from Calcutta to Dundee with a cargo of jute. After a month the ships captain decided to set off for the mainland using one of the ships small boats that had survived and a small boat that the St Kildans leant him.        The ships boat proved to be unsuitable and the crew cut that boat loose and used the St Kildan boat.\nBell From the Wreck Used for 60 Years\nThey eventually made it to the West coast of Harris and then on to Tarbert, where they left the boat and returned back via Stornoway to Greenock.       Some months later the St Kildans received a consignment of meal and flour and 9 pounds being to cover the St Kildans cost in getting their boat returned from Harris to St Kilda and the loan thereof.        The bell from the wreck was used by the St Kildans for over 60 years, the  replacement for the old bell was gifted by W.M.Hume & Co Ltd - Greenock as the original bell disappeared at the time of the evacuation\nThe Schoolroom\nThe Schoolroom was part of the church and was completed in 1899.         The church was renovated in 1899 and the schoolroom was finished, in 1938 it was describes as having two desks, sheet of linoleum used as a blackboard, a calendar for 1930 and a map showing England but not Scotland!\nPrior to the schoolroom., there had been several \"schools\" or at least teachings that were either carried out in the church itself or in peoples houses.\nIn 1860 each family was said to be well off, keeping 1 or two cows or a few sheep, along with a common stock of sheep.\nNo Thieving and Only 1 Illegitimate Child\nThere was no thieving and there was only one illegitimate child in the last twenty years.\nThere were family prayers in every house, each day, the children reading the Gaelic bible, the people were said to be very clean, however their houses were not very good at all, with no exit for the smoke and soot which was three inches thick at least.\nActually the soot was used in manure and each year the black straw from inside of the roof was removed and fresh straw laid inside.\nBronze Age\nIts not clear at all when the first settlers arrived at St Kilda, but tools found on Hirta do suggest that Bronze age travellers were there 4000 - 5000 years ago\nLand Apportionment\nEach tenant would have had their own portion of land, which could have been anywhere on the island, but these land apportionments were reallocated annually until in the 1830,s there were agricultural reforms which resulted in each tenant would have had his own strip of land on which he built his own house.\nBirds - Sea Breeding and Fowling\nThe St Kildans took gannets, fulmars and puffins which were used for food as well as some going towards paying their rent.\nThe breeding season bering March to September, this was the time when the islanders caught the birds, by hand or with a fowling rod.\nThe world's largest colony of gannets nests on Boreray and the sea stacs and St Kilda also has the British Isles largest colony of fulmars.\nWay of Life - Religion - Houses\nThere were no roads and the St Kildans carried all their produce, birds, or grain etc on their backs.\nThey went from island to island in small open boats. The produce was landed precariously on the rocks right up until 1901 when a small jetty was built.\nCatholics\nIn the 1600's it is recorded that the St Kildans who spoke Gaelic, were really quite a lively bunch and loved music, singing and dancing, they were originally Catholics as many Catholic priests visited and stayed for different periods on the island.\nFree Church - Tokens for Communion\nAs time went on and different ministers came and went, the St Kildans became supporters of the Free Church of Scotland which meant that they had a more quiet sedate life as frivolity was not part of the Free Churches teachings at all.\nIn the 18th century ministers were sent to the island and a church was built in the nineteenth century, along with a school in 1884. From the seventeenth century tokens were issued to parishioners as a sign that they were fit people to receive communion.\nPopulation\n1690 - Population of 180 who rented the land 1690 a population of around 180 has been recorded, these people rented the land from a landlord from the Island of Skye, a Macleod. from Dunvegan.\nUntil the 19th century, the rents that were actually paid would have been the produce from the island, which the landlord would then have sold on. The factor who collected these payments would have in turn given the islanders some much needed goods in return. The islanders would have given the factor barley, oats, fish, produce from their cattle, sheep, and especially seabirds\nIn 1697 the population is reputed to have been 180\nIn 1834 there were 93 inhabitants of twenty one families\nIn 1852 about a third of the population emigrated to Australia.\nIn 1860 it was said that the eldest lady on the island was sixty, although there seems to be some dispute about this\nLanding on Hirta - St Kilda\nIn 1860 the only means of landing on S Kilda or Hirta, would be to clear out an indentation amongst the rocks ( currently filled with large stones), erect a crane on the cliff above only 30ft high, and hoist up the boats, a committee of the Agricultural Society were involved with this project and it was agreed that £100 be set aside for this\nSoay Sheep\nSoay Sheep lived on the Island of Soay, these sheep lived as feral animals and belonged to the owner of the island. The Soay sheep are believed to have been the remnants of the earliest sheep to have been kept in Europe\nThe Soay sheep are usually small, brown, with white bellies and short tails and their fleeces moult on their own naturally. Quite a few Soay sheep live on St Kilda, after the evacuation of the villages they were transferred to Hirta. These sheep have survived and are from really primitive breeds which date back to the Bronze age.\nAs a part of an ongoing survey and with the onset of DNA technology, it has been possible to tell which rams have fathered which lambs each year. It's usual that a Soay ram would only father one or two lambs however it has been proved that one ram actually fathered detailed as \"Old Green 23\" had fathered 27 lambs!\nMice - the St Kilda mouse\nThere were two types of mouse on St Kilda, the field mouse and the St Kilda house mouse and both of these were much larger than those on the mainland. They are sub species maybe brought in the Viking times by Norsemen. The house mouse is now extinct but the St Kildan field mouse still remains.\nDaily Meeting - Parliament\nThe St Kildans days always began with a daily 'Parliament', a meeting held in the street every morning after prayers. All the adults males in the village went to this meeting, and helped to decide upon the day's activities. No one led the meeting, and all men had the right to speak.\nThe St Kildan Wren\nThis lovely bird is also a sub species of the wrens and is somewhat larger than other wrens. It is detailed now that there are believed to be around 115 pairs left on Hirta.

This balancing act was proof of their agility on the rocks.

                "Damon Albarn, OBE, (; born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. He is the lead singer of the alternative rock band Blur as well as co-founder, vocalist, principal songwriter, and instrumentalist of the virtual band Gorillaz.\n\nRaised in Leytonstone, East London and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended Stanway School, where he met Graham Coxon and eventually formed Blur whose debut album, Leisure, was released in 1991 to mixed reviews. After spending long periods of time touring the United States, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result of these influences came in the form of Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three albums received widespread critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a rivalry shared with Oasis. Subsequent albums contained influences from lo-fi, electronic and hip hop music such as Blur (1997), 13 (1999), Think Tank (2003), and The Magic Whip (2015). Albarn was voted the fourth-greatest frontman of all time in a 2010 UK Poll for Q Music magazine. \n\nIn 1998, Albarn along with Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett formed the \"virtual band\" Gorillaz. Drawing influences from alternative rock, trip hop,  hip hop, electronica, dub, reggae and pop music,   the band released their self-titled debut album in 2001 which was hugely successful worldwide. Although Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, the albums feature many collaborations from a wide range of artists. Gorillaz are cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the \"Most Successful Virtual Band\". Other projects include working with African musicians in aid of the charity Oxfam, writing and performing lead vocals on The Good, the Bad & the Queen as part of an unnamed supergroup featuring Tony Allen, Paul Simonon and Simon Tong and composing film soundtracks. He has also ventured into the world of opera with Dr Dee and Monkey: Journey to the West. He is also a Chelsea F.C. fan and frequently attends games involving the Blues at Stamford Bridge. \n\nAlbarn's debut solo studio album Everyday Robots was released on 28 April 2014, co-produced by XL Recordings CEO Richard Russell and featured collaborations with Brian Eno, Natasha Khan and the Leytonstone City Pentecostal Mission Church Choir as well as sampling several rants by Lord Buckley.\n\nHe was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to music. \n\nEarly life\n\nAlbarn was born on 23 March 1968, the eldest child of Keith and Hazel Albarn née Dring. Their daughter, Jessica, born in 1971, also went on to become an artist.  Hazel Albarn, originally from Lincolnshire, was a theatrical set designer for Joan Littlewood's theatre company at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in London and was working on the satirical play, Mrs Wilson's Diary, just before Damon was born. Keith Albarn, originally from Nottinghamshire, was briefly the manager of Soft Machine and a guest on BBC's Late Night Line-Up.  He was head of The School of Art and Design at Colchester Institute.\n\nDamon's paternal grandfather, Edward, an architect,   had been a conscientious objector during the Second World War and was involved in a farming community in Lincolnshire, becoming a peace activist. In 2002, Edward Albarn died, Damon stated in an interview that Edward did not want to live any longer and decided to go on a hunger strike. In 1968, at the age of 6 months, Damon Albarn was a \"testing expert\" for designs for educational aids and toys for children including fiberglass furniture and play-structures fancifully called \"The Kissmequiosk\". \"The Apollo Cumfycraft\" and \"The Tailendcharlie\" produced by his father's company \"Keith Albarn & Partners Ltd\" under the trade-name of \"Playlearn, Ltd.\" \n\nWhen Damon and Jessica were growing up, their family moved to Leytonstone, East London. The household was described as \"bohemian\"  and their upbringing as \"liberal\". Damon agreed with his parents' views, later claiming, \"I always thought my parents were absolutely dead right. I went against the grain in a weird way – by continually following them.\" His parents primarily listened to blues, Indian ragas and African music. When Damon was 9 years old, his family took a holiday trip to Turkey for three months before settling in Aldham, Essex, an area described by Albarn as \"one of those burgeoning Thatcher experiments where they were building loads of small estates\".  The population of the area was predominantly white as opposed to the ethnically mixed part of London which he had become used to. He described himself as \"not really fitting in with the politics of the place.\"\n\nAlbarn was interested in music from an early age, attending an Osmonds concert at the age of six. He started playing guitar, piano and violin in his youth and was interested in composing music, one of his compositions winning a heat in the nationwide Young Composer of the Year competition. Damon and Jessica both attended a primary school nearby which, according to Damon, was burnt down seven times in a time period of 18 months by one of the teachers. After both siblings failed their Eleven-Plus exam, they started attending Stanway Comprehensive School, where Damon described himself as being \"really unpopular\" and \"[irritating to] a lot of people\". However, he developed an interest in Drama and started acting in various school productions. It was at Stanway where he would meet future Blur guitarist, Graham Coxon, who recalls seeing him act and feeling that he was a \"confident performer\" as well as a \"show off\". Albarn's first words directed at Coxon were \"Your brogues are crap, mate. Look, mine are the proper sort\" as he was showing off his leather shoes, fashionable footwear at the time influenced by the Mod Revival. Nevertheless, the pair went on to become good friends, due to their shared passion for music, particularly bands such as The Jam, The Beatles, The Human League, XTC and Madness.\n\nHe studied acting at the East 15 Acting School in Debden, but left after the first year. On leaving drama school he worked as a tea boy at the Beat Factory studio. His first band was the synthpop group, Two's a Crowd. Before Blur, he played with The Aftermath and Real Lives.\n\nMusic career\n\nBlur\n\nFormation and Leisure\n\nAlbarn enrolled on a part-time music course at London's Goldsmiths College in 1988, claiming that his sole intention was to gain access to the student union bar.  Albarn was in a group named Circus alongside Coxon and drummer Dave Rowntree.   Alex James, a fellow student at Goldsmiths, eventually joined as the group's bassist. They changed their name to Seymour in December 1988, inspired by J.D. Salinger's Seymour: An Introduction.  Seymour attracted the interest of Food Records whose only concern was that they disliked the band's name. Food drew up a list of alternatives, from which the band decided on \"Blur\". Food Records finally signed the newly christened band in March 1990. \n\nIn October 1990, Blur released their first single, \"She's So High\", which reached number 48 in the UK Singles Chart. The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, but they made progress when paired with producer Stephen Street. The resulting single release, \"There's No Other Way\", became a hit, peaking at number eight.  As a result of the single's success, Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented The Syndrome club in London dubbed \"The Scene That Celebrates Itself\".  NME magazine wrote in 1991 that \"[Blur] are [the] acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started to run out of steam.\" \n\nAndy Ross and Food owner David Balfe were convinced Blur's best course of action was to continue drawing influence from the Madchester genre. Blur attempted to expand their musical sound, but the recording of the group's debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio. Although the resulting album Leisure (1991) peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart, it received mixed reviews, and according to journalist John Harris, \"could not shake off the odour of anti-climax\".  Albarn has since referred to Leisure as \"awful\". \n\nBritpop era\n\nAfter discovering they were £60,000 in debt, Blur toured the United States in 1992 in an attempt to recoup their financial losses.  During the two-month American tour, Albarn, along with the band, became increasingly unhappy and homesick. \"I just started to miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so I started writing songs which created an English atmosphere\", Albarn revealed. \n\nBlur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana.  Although skeptical of Albarn's new manifesto for the band, Balfe gave his assent for the band's choice of Andy Partridge of the band XTC to produce their follow-up to Leisure. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group. \n\nTheir second album, titled Modern Life Is Rubbish, was eventually released in May 1993 and peaked at number 15 on the British charts,  but failed to break into the US Billboard 200, selling only 19,000 copies there. \"[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/blur-mn0000758444/awards Blur – Awards]\". Allmusic; retrieved 21 August 2012. Despite the album's poor performance, Albarn was relatively happy with the band's new direction and started writing prolifically for Blur's next album. Parklife was released in 1994 and revived Blur's commercial fortunes, with the album's first single, the disco-influenced \"Girls & Boys\", receiving critical acclaim and chart success. Parklife entered the British charts at number one and stayed in the album charts for 90 weeks.  Enthusiastically greeted by the music press, Parklife is regarded as one of Britpop's defining records.   Blur won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards, including Best Band and Best Album for Parklife.  Coxon later pointed to Parklife as the moment when \"[Blur] went from being regarded as an alternative, left field arty band to this amazing new pop sensation\".  Albarn revealed that his fame made him uncomfortable, however, and that he often suffered from panic attacks.\n\nBlur began working on their fourth album The Great Escape at the start of 1995.  Building upon the band's previous two albums, Albarn's lyrics for the album consisted of several third-person narratives. James reflected, \"It was all more elaborate, more orchestral, more theatrical, and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional, misfit characters fucking up.\"  The release of the album's lead single \"Country House\" played a part in Blur's public rivalry with Manchester band Oasis termed \"The Battle of Britpop\". Partly due to increasing antagonisms between the groups, Blur and Oasis ultimately decided to release their new singles on the same day, an event the NME called \"The British Heavyweight Championship\". The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon, and Albarn appeared on the News at Ten.Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop. Passion Pictures, 2004. At the end of the week, \"Country House\" ultimately outsold Oasis' \"Roll With It\" by 274,000 copies to 216,000, becoming Blur's first number one single. \n\nThe Great Escape was released in September 1995 to positive reviews, and entered the UK charts at number one. However, opinion quickly changed and Blur found themselves largely out of favour with the media once again. Following the worldwide success of Oasis' (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, the media quipped that \"[Blur] wound up winning the battle but losing the war.\"  Blur became perceived by many as an \"inauthentic middle class pop band\" in comparison to the \"working class heroes\" Oasis, which Albarn said made him feel \"stupid and confused\". Bassist Alex James later summarised, \"After being the People's Hero, Damon was the People's Prick for a short period ... basically, he was a loser – very publicly.\" \n\nPost–Britpop and hiatus\n\nAn early 1996 Q magazine interview revealed that relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy wrote that he found them \"on the verge of a nervous breakup\". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his band mates and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement.  Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. \"I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on\", he said, and decided to let Coxon have more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period, stating that, \"I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day [laughs], I was watching the TV and I saw a programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I got on a plane, and booked into the Saga hotel. I didn't know it meant Saga holidays, for older people—I thought it was Saga as in Nordic sagas. But it was actually an OAP cruise hotel. I was on my own: I didn't know anybody. I went into the street, Laugavegur, where the bars are, and that was it.\" \n\nAfter initial sessions in London, the band left to record the rest of the album in Iceland, away from the Britpop scene. The result was Blur, the band's fifth studio album, released in February 1997. Although the music press predicted that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur's teenage girl fan-base, they generally applauded the effort. Pointing out lyrics such as \"Look inside America/She's alright\", and noting Albarn's \"obligatory nod to Beck, [and promotion of] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so\", reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time—an about-face of their attitude during the Britpop years.  Despite cries of \"commercial suicide\", the album and its first single, \"Beetlebum\", debuted at number one in the UK.  Although the album could not match the sales of their previous albums in the UK, Blur became the band's most successful internationally, particularly in the US, helped by the successful single, \"Song 2\". After the success of Blur, the band embarked on a nine-month world tour.\n\nBlur hired William Orbit to produce their next album. Released in March 1999, Blur's sixth studio album 13 saw them drift still further away from their Britpop-era attitude and sound. Albarn's lyrics—more heart-felt, personal and intimate than on previous occasions—were reflective of his break-up with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann, his partner of eight years. \n\nIn October 2000, the group released the best-of album Blur: The Best of, which debuted at number three in the UK and a Platinum certification of 300,000 copies.  Dismissed by the band as \"the first record we have seen as product\", the tracklisting and release dates of Blur: The Best of were determined on the basis of market research and focus groups conducted by Blur's record label, EMI. \n\nRecording for Blur's next album began in London in November 2001. Not long after the sessions began, Coxon left the group.  Coxon stated \"there were no rows\" and \"[the band] just recognised the feeling that we needed some time apart\". \n\nThink Tank, released in May 2003, was filled with atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist's absence also meant that Think Tank was almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound was seen as a testament to Albarn's increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group's creative direction.  Think Tank was another UK No. 1 and managed Blur's highest US position of No. 56. The album was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards. \n\nReunion\n\nIn December 2008, Blur announced they would reunite for a concert at London's Hyde Park on 3 July 2009.  Days later, the band added a second date, for 2 July.  A series of June preview shows were also announced, ending at Manchester Evening News arena on the 26th. All the shows were well received; The Guardians music critic Alexis Petridis gave their performance at Goldsmiths college a full five stars, and wrote that \"Blur's music seems to have potentiated by the passing of years ... they sound both more frenetic and punky and more nuanced and exploratory than they did at the height of their fame\".  Blur headlined the Glastonbury Festival on 28 June, where they played for the first time since their headline slot in 1998. Reviews of the Glastonbury performance were enthusiastic, The Guardian called them \"the best Glastonbury headliners in an age\". \n\nThe band released their second greatest hits album Midlife: A Beginner's Guide to Blur in June 2009. After the completion of the reunion dates, Albarn told Q that the band had no intention of recording or touring live again. He said, \"I just can't do it anymore\", and explained that the main motivation for participating in the reunion was to repair his relationship with Coxon, which succeeded. \n\nIn January 2010, No Distance Left to Run, a documentary about the band, was released in cinemas and a month later on DVD and was nominated as Best Long Form Music Video for the 53rd Grammy Awards, Blur's first-ever Grammy nomination.   In April 2010, Blur released their first new recording since 2003, \"Fool's Day\" in April 2010 as part of the Record Store Day event as a vinyl record limited to 1000 copies; it was later made available as a free download on their website. \n\nIn February 2012, Blur were awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the 2012 Brit Awards.  Later that month, Albarn and Coxon premiered a new track together live, \"Under the Westway\".  In April, the band announced that a box-set entitled Blur 21—containing all seven Blur studio albums, four discs of unreleased rarities and three DVDs—would be released in July. \n\nBlur entered the studio early that year to record material for a new album, but in May producer William Orbit told the NME that Albarn had halted recording.  Blur's official Twitter and Facebook pages announced that the band would release two singles \"The Puritan\" and \"Under the Westway\" on 2 July.  That August, Blur headlined a show at Hyde Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony which was followed by a world tour the very next year. \n\nOn 19 February 2015, Blur announced on social media that they would be releasing their eighth studio album on 27 April, titled The Magic Whip, Blur's first album in 12 years and first in 16 years in their original lineup.  \n\nGorillaz\n\nDamon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett first met in 1990 when Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur. The interview was published in Deadline magazine, home of Hewlett's comic strip, Tank Girl. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was \"arsey, a wanker\" and despite becoming one of the band's acquaintances, he often didn't get on with its members, especially after he started going out with Coxon's ex-girlfriend, Jane Olliver. Nonetheless, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997.  Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was also at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.\n\nThe idea to create Gorillaz came about when the two were watching MTV: \"If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell—there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that,\" Hewlett has said. The band's music is a collaboration between various musicians, Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor. Their style is broadly alternative rock, but with a large number of other influences including Britpop, dub, hip-hop, and pop music.   In 2001, the band's eponymous debut album sold over seven million copies, and featured hits such as the songs \"19-2000\" and \"Clint Eastwood,\" earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band.  It was nominated for the Mercury Prize 2001, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request. \n\nTheir second studio album, Demon Days, was released in 2005 and included the singles \"Feel Good Inc.\", \"Dare\", \"Dirty Harry\" and \"Kids with Guns\"/\"El Mañana\". Demon Days went five times platinum in the UK,  double platinum in the United States  and earned five Grammy Award nominations for 2006  and won one of them in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category.  In November 2005, they staged the first-ever live performances of Demon Days Live involving many of the artists who had played on the successful Demon Days album, as a launch event for the festival. Gorillaz released two B-sides compilations and a remix album. The combined sales of Gorillaz and Demon Days had, by 2007, exceeded 15 million albums. \n\nGorillaz released their third studio album, Plastic Beach, in early 2010, which was received with high praise. In December 2010, the group released an album called The Fall which was recorded over 32 days during their North American tour. The band also appeared on the Snoop Dogg track: \"Sumthing' Like this Night\" on his album Doggumentary. In November 2011, the band announced that, on 23 February 2012, Gorillaz would release a new line of Converse sneakers designed by Jamie Hewlett. The selection of footwear is carried at Journeys stores in the US and Schuh stores in the UK. Gorillaz will release a new one off single to accompany with the release of these shoes as a part of Converse's \"Three Artists, One Song\" campaign. \n\nOn 9 February 2012, Gorillaz confirmed that the single will be called \"DoYaThing\", and that the two collaborators working on this single will be James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem and Andre 3000 of Outkast. 2D will rap for the first two verses, Murphy will sing the chorus, and Andre 3000 then overtakes the rest of the track with another rap verse. The track is available for free download in Journeys stores by scanning the QR Code on display items. An explicit, 12 Minute long version of the single was made available for streaming in March. Hewlett directed a new Music Video for the single, featuring animated versions of the two collaborators on this track.   Murdoc also stated that the music video featured the Gorillaz' new HQ, for which they have abandoned Plastic Beach.\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Albarn talked about the unlikelihood of any future releases from the Gorillaz. His relationship with artist Jamie Hewlett soured when Albarn chose to undercut the role of animation on their Escape to Plastic Beach World Tour.  Albarn later rescinded this claim, stating \"When Jamie [Hewlett] and I have worked out our differences, I'm sure we'll make another record.\" \n\nWhile promoting his debut album, Everyday Robots, in an interview with NME, Albarn said: \"I can definitely see another Gorillaz-esque record at some point, yeah. That will almost definitely happen. I could put a Gorillaz record out next week; I’ve got enough stuff that I haven’t finished. The only thing really that defines a Gorillaz record in my head is when I just play most of it on keyboards. I’ve just been in Paris with Jamie Hewlett. There are points in everyone's relationship where they fall out with people that they're close to and then they reconcile, hopefully, and actually, you know, the relationship's probably in a healthier place as a result of that.\" \n\nIn October 2015, Albarn revealed that both he and Hewlett are working on a new Gorillaz album. Albarn said: \"I'm in the very early days on a new Gorillaz record. So far, it's really fast, and it's got quite a lot of energy. I've been stuck on piano, somewhere off Broadway, for years now. I want to go somewhere completely opposite of that.\" \n\nSolo career and side-projects\n\nIn 2003, Albarn released an EP called Democrazy, which was a compilation of demos he recorded in various hotel rooms during the United States portion of Think Tanks tour. During September 2011, Albarn had confirmed he was working on solo studio album to be released under his own name, the concept of which is supposed to revolve around \"empty club music\". \n\nIn a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Albarn announced that the solo record would be produced by Richard Russell of XL Recordings. He also said he would be taking his album on tour, and that he would play songs from all of his other bands, including Blur and Gorillaz. \n\nOn 3 December 2013, Damon performed various songs for his upcoming solo album in a private gig at Fox Studios in Los Angeles. On 11 December 2013, Albarn released a 21-second teaser trailer of his upcoming solo album on his official YouTube channel, which he had also shared on his Facebook and Twitter pages. This trailer featured a preview of a song for the solo album and revealed that the album is set for release during 2014. \n\nWhile hosting BBC Radio 2 alongside Paul Simonon and Idris Elba, Albarn mentioned that the Leytonstone City Mission Choir and Brian Eno will be guest collaborators for his solo album.  In an interview with Bat for Lashes, Natasha Khan revealed that she is also be going to be a collaborator for Albarn's upcoming solo album. \n\nOn 18 January 2014, the Warner Music Store was updated to include Albarn's solo album, Everyday Robots, set for a release date of 28 April 2014. \n\nEveryday Robots\n\nEveryday Robots was released on 25 April 2014 to generally positive reviews. The album peaked at No. 2 on the UK charts.  The album has produced five singles: \"Everyday Robots\", \"Lonely Press Play\", \"Hollow Ponds\", US-only release \"Mr Tembo\", and \"Heavy Seas of Love\". It was nominated for the 2014 Mercury Prize for Best Album.\n\nAfrican music\n\nAlbarn released Mali Music in 2002, recorded in Mali, during a trip he made to support Oxfam in 2000. He has visited Nigeria to record music with African drummer Tony Allen.\n\nCollaborating with producers Dan the Automator, XL Recordings, Richard Russell & Rodaidh McDonald, Jneiro Jarel, DJ Darren Cunningham aka Actress, Marc Antoine, Alwest, Remi Kabaka Jr., Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs and Kwes, Damon Albarn went to Kinshasa for one week to record an album called Kinshasa One Two.  The Congolese band Tout Puissant Mukalo joined them as well. All proceeds will benefit Oxfam's work in the DRC.  The album was released by Warp Records. \n\nMaison Des Jeunes, an album for Albarn's project Africa Express, was released in 2013.  In 2014, Damon Albarn appeared in the song \"Go Back\" in Tony Allen's album Film of Life.\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Queen\n\nIn May 2006, NME reported that Albarn was working with Danger Mouse on his first solo album, tentatively titled The Good, the Bad & the Queen.    It featured Paul Simonon, Simon Tong and Tony Allen. The album was awarded Best Album at the 2007 MOJO Awards on 18 June. \n\nThe first single by the line-up, \"Herculean\", was released in late October 2006, and peaked at No. 22 in the UK Singles Chart. A second single, \"Kingdom of Doom\", and the band's debut album were then released in January 2007. That single fared slightly better than \"Herculean\", peaking at No. 20, while the album peaked at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart and went gold during its first week of release in the UK.  \"Green Fields\" was released as the third single from the album in April 2007, just missing out on the Top 50. On 27 April 2008, The Good, the Bad & the Queen headlined the Love Music Hate Racism Carnival in Victoria Park where they introduced on stage several guests including ex-Specials keyboard player Jerry Dammers.   He also worked with Syrian rapper and friend Eslam Jawaad on the song \"Mr. Whippy\", though the song does not appear on the album it is a B-Side on the Herculean single. \n\nRocket Juice and the Moon\n\nRocket Juice & the Moon is the title of Albarn's new side-project featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and afrobeat legend Tony Allen. Albarn has stated that he is not responsible for the name; someone in Lagos did the sleeve design and that's the name it was given. Albarn has claimed that he's content with the outcome, as trying to come up with band names is difficult for him. The band performed together for the first time on 28 October 2011 in Cork, Ireland, as part of the annual Cork Jazz Festival. They performed under the moniker Another Honest Jon's Chop Up!. A full tour is not expected any time soon due to conflicting schedules, with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' tour continuing until 2013. Their debut album was released on 26 March 2012. \n\nOther appearances\n\nIn 1998, Albarn and Michael Nyman recorded the song \"London Pride\" for the tribute album, Twentieth-Century Blues: The Songs of Noël Coward, a patriotic song Noël Coward had written in the spring of 1941 during the Blitz. \n\nAlbarn has contributed backing vocals to the songs \"FM\" on Nathan Haines' Squire for Hire and \"Small Time Shot Away\" on Massive Attack's 100th Window, which were released in 2003, however, for both tracks, credit was given to Gorillaz frontman 2D instead. More recently, on Massive Attack's 2010 Heligoland album, he sang on the track \"Saturday Come Slow\" and contributed keyboards to the track \"Splitting the Atom\". \n\nAlbarn also produced soul singer Bobby Womack's twenty-seventh studio album The Bravest Man in the Universe, released in 2012. He recently performed on Jools Holland's Hootenanny on New Year's Eve, performing track \"Love is Gonna Lift You Up\".  Albarn appeared with Womack at the Glastonbury Festival 2013.\n\nHe is set to make an appearance on the alternative hip-hop trio De La Soul's studio album And the Anonymous Nobody on the song \"Here in After\".   \n\nFilm, theatre and soundtrack work\n\n\"Closet Romantic\" appeared on the soundtrack for Trainspotting alongside an early Blur recording, \"Sing\". Albarn composed the score with collaboration by Michael Nyman for the 1999 movie Ravenous, and was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for his work.\n\nIn their first major work together since Gorillaz, Albarn and Hewlett, along with acclaimed Chinese theatre and opera director Chen Shi-zheng, adapted for stage the Chinese story Journey to the West as Monkey: Journey to the West, which received its world premiere as the opening show of the 2007 Manchester International Festival, on 28 June 2007 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester. \n\nIn collaboration with theatre director Rufus Norris, Albarn has created an opera for the 2011 Manchester International Festival based on the life of Elizabethan scientist John Dee and titled Doctor Dee.  \n\nAlbarn recorded the film score for the film version of the book The Boy in the Oak, which was written by his sister, Jessica Albarn. The film was set for a spring 2011 release in select theatres. \n\nAlbarn wrote the music for an upcoming musical based on Alice in Wonderland called Wonder.land with Rufus Norris and Moira Buffini, which is set to officially premiere in the Manchester International Festival on 29 June 2015.   \n\nThe Heavy Seas\n\nAlbarn's live band is called The Heavy Seas, and features guitarist Seye, drummer Pauli the PSM, guitarist Jeff Wootton and Mike Smith on keyboards.  Both Smith and Wootton had previously been a part of Gorillaz' Escape to Plastic Beach World Tour. \n\nActing career\n\nAlbarn starred in Antonia Bird's 1997 film Face alongside Ray Winstone and Robert Carlyle. Albarn was also featured in Gunar Karlsson's 2007 film, Anna and the Moods, along with Terry Jones and Björk. Albarn played \"Bull\" in Joe Orton's Up Against It, a Radio 4 play about the Beatles broadcast in 1998.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2005 Albarn, among others, criticised the London Live 8 concert for not featuring enough black artists; among the few included were Ms. Dynamite, Snoop Dogg, and Youssou N'Dour. Eventually the organisers added a separate concert at the Eden Project in Cornwall to the programme in order to showcase African musicians. Albarn said he did not want to perform at Live 8 because he thought it was too \"exclusive\" and may have been motivated by self-promotion.\n\nAlbarn has been a vocal critic of celebrity culture:\"We need to dismantle very significant parts of our culture and really re-examine them. I suppose you start with the celebrity thing... you have to get rid of things like The X Factor immediately.\" \n\nIn 2006, Albarn was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from the University of East London, saying it was \"great to receive [the] award from an institution where my dad used to work and which I, as a child, used to think of as that big building with lots of interesting people in\". \n\nIn 2016, Albarn, a long-time advocate of the music of Northwestern African Country Mali, titling his 2002 album Mali Music, has been given the title “Local King\", and has received a school of music and dance named after him. \n\nRelationships\n\nDuring the 1990s Albarn had a long-standing relationship with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann.  This relationship profoundly influenced his songwriting, notably on the Blur album (1997) on the track \"Beetlebum\" – said to be about their experiences with heroin  – and a number of tracks on 13 (1999), such as \"Tender\" and \"No Distance Left to Run\", said to be about their break-up in 1998.\n\nFatherhood\n\nOn October 2, 1999, artist Suzi Winstanley gave birth to their daughter,  named after hip hop artist Missy Elliott. Albarn described becoming a father as \"witnessing a life force\" and saying that \"it massively changes you. It slowly sort of shaves off the unpleasant thorny bits and hopefully creates a nicely rounded... I don't know, having a kid, you just become far more, inevitably you look to the future far more and, you know, it's desperate sometimes when you have a particularly bad few weeks of the newspaper just reminding you about this is wrong, this is wrong. We've got ten more years everyone.\"\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nAlbarn has been an active supporter of various charities and philanthropic efforts throughout his career as a musician and has been involved in various charity albums and singles. DRC Music, a collective formed by Albarn, released their debut album Kinshasa One Two as a charity album in which all of the money earned is given to Oxfam.  Albarn has also formed a collective with Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner, and Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos to make a charity single with the money earned from that single also donated to Oxfam.  In 2013, Albarn alongside fellow Blur bandmate Graham Coxon performed live with former rival Noel Gallagher of Oasis and Paul Weller of The Jam to play Blur's 1999 single 'Tender' in support of Teenage Cancer Trust.   \n\nPolitics\n\nAnti-war campaigns\n\nAlbarn is anti-war, holding views shared by others in his family, including his grandfather Edward Albarn, who died on hunger strike in 2002. \n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, a series of controversial military campaigns were launched, known as the War on Terror. In November 2001, shortly after the invasion of Afghanistan, the MTV Europe Music Awards were held in Frankfurt, where Gorillaz won awards for Best Song and Best Dance.  As Albarn and Jamie Hewlett walked onto stage to make a speech after receiving the latter award, Albarn wore a T-shirt with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament logo on it. In his speech, he said \"So, fuck the music. Listen. See this symbol here, [pointing to the t shirt] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Bombing one of the poorest countries in the world is wrong. You've got a voice and you have got to do what you can about it alright?\"    \n\nIn 2002, Iraq was under threat of invasion from a coalition which included the United States and the United Kingdom. Opposition from the public led to protests being organised by a number of organisations. Albarn, who has described himself as being anti-war, spoke out against the invasion.   \n\nAlbarn teamed up with Robert \"3D\" Del Naja of Massive Attack and worked with Stop the War Coalition, CND and the Muslim Association of Britain to organise campaigns to raise awareness of the potential dangers of the UK's involvement in the war. This included spending £15,000 on anti-war adverts which ran in the NME, featuring quotes from Tony Benn and the former US Attorney-General, Ramsey Clark.\n\nAlbarn revealed that originally, many people who he knew were against the war were reluctant to take a stand, stating \"to be honest with you when Robert Del Naja and myself started really stepping up prior to the war it was very difficult to find anyone. And I don't want to name any names because they are people who I respect but they were really, for some reason, very reticent to stand with us. A lot of people who you would now associate with being anti-war at that particular point didn't seem to be prepared to do it.\"\n\nAlbarn was due to speak in Hyde Park on the rally in February 2003 when a million people took to the streets of London in protest at the imminent war. In the event, he was too emotional to deliver his speech. Albarn later revealed that he had \"this image of my grandad in his slippers reading the paper, knowing that his grandson had been involved in something which he'd put so much of his life into\" and \"got over-emotional\". He also stated that \"it obviously wasn't the best moment to get in that state, when you're at the head of the biggest peace march in the history of this country.\"\n\nAlbarn also attended a protest in November where he commented on the diversity of people in attendance, saying that \"It represents everybody. It's the voice in our democracy and that's why we should be listened to.\"  Speaking about the experience in 2008, Albarn stated \"I think in this case the only reason we went to war was the result of our individual apathy in the end. You know, our inability to really express what was I think was a consensus that this was a terrifying idea and a very badly thought-out one.\"\n\nDiscography\n\n \n\nSolo albums\n\n* Everyday Robots (2014)\n\nSolo EPs\n\n* Democrazy (vinyl only double-EP of demos) (2003)\n\nLive albums\n\n*Live at the De De De Der (2014)\n\nCollaboration albums & EP's\n\n* Mali Music (2002) (with Afel Bocoum, Toumani Diabaté & Friends)\n* The Good, the Bad & the Queen (2007) (with Tony Allen, Paul Simonon and Simon Tong)\n* Live from SoHo (iTunes Exclusive EP) (2007) (with Tony Allen, Paul Simonon & Simon Tong) \n* Kinshasa One Two (2011) (as part of DRC Music)\n* Rocket Juice & the Moon (2012) (with Flea and Tony Allen as part of \"Rocket Juice and the Moon\")\n* Leave-Taking (2012) (as part of Rocket Juice & the Moon)\n* Maison Des Jeunes (2013) (as part of Africa Express)\n* In C Mali (2014) (as part of Africa Express)\n\nFilm, opera and theatre soundtracks\n\n* Ravenous (1999) (with Michael Nyman)\n* 101 Reykjavík (2002) (with Einar Örn Benediktsson)\n* Monkey: Journey to the West (2008)\n* Dr Dee (2012)\n* wonder.land (2016)\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nMercury Prize\n\nThe Mercury Prize is a highly prestigious annual music prize awarded for the best album from the United Kingdom and Ireland.

                "The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1963 by brothers Dave and Ray Davies. They are regarded as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era.   The band emerged in 1964 during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the US until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies penned \"You Really Got Me\",  became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.  Between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, the group released a string of hit singles; studio albums drew good reviews but sold less than compilations of their singles. They gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' observational writing style. Albums such as Something Else (1967), The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society (1968), Arthur (1969), Lola Versus Powerman (1970), along with their accompanying singles, are considered among the most influential recordings of the period. \n\nAfter a fallow period in the mid Seventies, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with albums Sleepwalker, Misfits, Low Budget, Give the People What They Want and State of Confusion. In addition, groups such as  Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack, the Pretenders and the Fall covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence. The Kinks broke up in 1996, a result of the commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers. \n\nTheir music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run. Longest-serving member Mick Avory (drums and percussion) was replaced by Bob Henrit, formerly of Argent, in 1984. Original bassist Pete Quaife was replaced by John Dalton in 1969, and Dalton was in turn replaced by Jim Rodford in 1978. Session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band in the studio for many of their recordings in the mid-to-late 1960s. In 1969 keyboardist John Gosling joined the band, making them an official five-piece, while Ian Gibbons replaced him in 1979, playing in the band until its eventual demise.\n\nThe group had five Top 10 singles on the US Billboard chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, the group had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums.  Four of their albums have been certified gold by the RIAA. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Service to British Music\".  In 1990, the original four members of the Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005.\n\nHistory \n\nFormation (1962–63) \n\nThe Davies brothers were born in suburban North London on Huntingdon Road, East Finchley, the youngest and only boys among their family's eight children.  Their parents, Frederick and Annie Davies,  moved the family to 6 Denmark Terrace, Fortis Green, in the neighbouring suburb of Muswell Hill.  At home they were immersed in a world of varied musical styles, from the music hall of their parents' generation to the jazz and early rock and roll that their older sisters enjoyed. \n\nThomas Kitts writes, \"The influence of these parties on the Kinks... is remarkable. Whether consciously or unconsciously, [onstage] it seemed as if Ray was trying to recreate the Saturday night parties of his family's home—complete with chaos, beer and singalongs.\"  Both Ray and his brother Dave, younger by almost three years, learned to play guitar, and they played skiffle and rock and roll together.\n\nThe brothers attended William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later merged with Tollington Grammar School to become Fortismere School), where they formed a band, the Ray Davies Quartet, with Ray's friend and classmate Pete Quaife and Quaife's friend John Start. Their debut at a school dance was well received, which encouraged the group to play at local pubs and bars. The band went through a series of lead vocalists, including Rod Stewart,  another student at William Grimshaw,  who performed with the group at least once in early 1962.  He then formed his own group, Rod Stewart and the Moonrakers, which became a local rival to the Ray Davies Quartet.\n\nIn late 1962, Ray Davies left home to study at Hornsey College of Art. He pursued interests in subjects such as film, sketching, theatre and music such as jazz and blues. He gained experience as a guitarist with the Soho-based Dave Hunt Band, a professional group of musicians who played jazz and R&B,   before abandoning college and returning to Muswell Hill, where the brothers and Quaife re-formed their old group, performing under several names, including the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, and the Ramrods, before (temporarily) settling on the Ravens. \n\nThe fledgling group hired two managers, Grenville Collins and Robert Wace, and in late 1963 former pop singer Larry Page became their third manager. American record producer Shel Talmy began working with the band, and the Beatles' promoter, Arthur Howes, was retained to schedule the Ravens' live shows.  The group unsuccessfully auditioned for various record labels until early 1964, when Talmy secured them a contract with Pye Records. During this period they had acquired a new drummer, Mickey Willet; however, Willet left the band shortly before they signed to Pye. The Ravens invited Mick Avory to replace him after seeing an advertisement Avory had placed in Melody Maker.  Avory had a background in jazz drumming and had played one gig with the fledgling Rolling Stones.\n\nAround this period, the Ravens decided on a new, permanent name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In Jon Savage's analysis, they \"needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage.\"  Manager Robert Wace related his side of the story: \"I had a friend... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity... When we went to [the band members] with the name, they were... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky! Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's—he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their \"kinky\" fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, \"The way you look, and the clothes you wear, you ought to be called the Kinks.\" \"I've never really liked the name,\" Ray stated.\n\n\"You Really Got Me\" and American touring ban (1964–65) \n\nThe band's first single was a cover of the Little Richard song \"Long Tall Sally\". Bobby Graham, a friend of the band,  was recruited to play drums on the recording. He would continue to occasionally substitute for Avory in the studio and play on several of the Kinks' early singles, including the early hits \"You Really Got Me\", \"All Day and All of the Night\" and \"So Tired of Waiting\".  \"Long Tall Sally\" was released in February 1964, but despite the publicity efforts of the band's managers, the single was almost completely ignored. When their second single, \"You Still Want Me\", failed to chart,  Pye Records threatened to annul the group's contract unless their third single was successful.\n\n\"You Really Got Me\", a Ray Davies song, influenced by American blues and the Kingsmen's version of \"Louie Louie\",  was recorded on 15 June 1964 at Pye studios with a slower and more produced feel than the final single.    Ray Davies wanted to rerecord the song with a lean, raw sound, but Pye refused to fund another session; Davies took an adamant stand, so the producer, Shel Talmy, broke the stalemate by under-writing the session himself.  The band used an independent studio, IBC, and went in on 15 July, getting it done in two takes. The single was released on August 1964, and, supported by a performance on the television show Ready Steady Go! and extensive pirate radio coverage, it entered the UK charts on August 15, reaching number one on September 19.  Hastily imported by the American label Reprise Records, it also made the Top 10 in the United States. The loud, distorted guitar riff and solo on \"You Really Got Me\" was played by Dave Davies and achieved by a slice Dave Davies made in the speaker cone of his Elpico amplifier (referred to by the band as the \"little green amp\")— helped with the song's signature, gritty guitar sound.  \"You Really Got Me\" has been described as \"a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal\", and as an influence on the approach of some American garage rock bands.  After its release, the group recorded most of the tracks for their debut LP, simply titled Kinks. Consisting largely of covers and revamped traditional songs, it was released on 2 October 1964, reaching number four on the UK chart.  The group's fourth single, \"All Day and All of the Night\", another Ray Davies hard rock tune, was released three weeks later, reaching number two in the United Kingdom, and number seven in the United States.  The next singles, \"Set Me Free\" and \"Tired of Waiting for You\", were also commercially successful, the latter topping the UK singles chart. \n\nThe group made their first tour of Australia, New Zealand  beginning in January 1965 as part of a package bill that included Manfred Mann and The Honeycombs.  An intensive performing schedule saw them headline other package tours throughout the year with acts such as The Yardbirds and Mickey Finn.  Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \"You Really Got Me\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head.  To placate the police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.\n\nFollowing a mid-year tour of the United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts there for the next four years, effectively cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music at the height of the British Invasion.   Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.\n\nA stopover in Bombay, India, during the band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies to write the song \"See My Friends\", released as a single in July 1965.  This was an early example of crossover music, and one of the first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian subcontinent. Davies had written \"See My Friends\" with a raga feel after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen.  Music historian Jonathan Bellman argues that the song was \"extremely influential\" on Davies' musical peers: \"And while much has been made of the Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' because it was the first pop record to use a sitar, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released.\" Pete Townshend of the Who was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music.\"  In a widely quoted  statement by Barry Fantoni, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: \"I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must get one of those. The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US. \n\nRecording began promptly on the group's next project, Kinda Kinks, starting the day after their return from the Asian tour. The LP—10 of whose 12 songs were originals—was completed and released within two weeks.    According to Ray Davies, the band was not completely satisfied with the final cuts, but pressure from the record company meant that no time was available to correct flaws in the mix. Davies later expressed his dissatisfaction with the production, saying, \"a bit more care should have been taken with it. I think [producer] Shel Talmy went too far in trying to keep in the rough edges. Some of the double tracking on that is appalling. It had better songs on it than the first album, but it wasn't executed in the right way. It was just far too rushed.\"\n\nA significant stylistic shift became evident in late 1965, with the appearance of singles like \"A Well Respected Man\" and \"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\", as well as the band's third album, The Kink Kontroversy, on which session musician Nicky Hopkins made his first appearance with the group on keyboards.  These recordings exemplified the development of Davies' songwriting style, from hard-driving rock numbers toward songs rich in social commentary, observation and idiosyncratic character study, all with a uniquely English flavour.\n\nThe Golden Age (1966–72) \n\nThe satirical single \"Sunny Afternoon\" was the biggest UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and displacing the Beatles' \"Paperback Writer\".  Before the release of The Kink Kontroversy, Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles.  During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction. Quaife was involved in an automobile accident, and after his recovery decided to step back from the band for much of 1966. Bassist John Dalton filled in until Quaife returned to the group at the end of the year.\n\n\"Sunny Afternoon\" was a dry run for the band's next album Face to Face, which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft gentle yet cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people. Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and harpsichord. He played on the band's next two studio albums as well, and featured on a number of their live BBC recordings before joining The Jeff Beck Group in 1968. Face to Face was released in the UK in October 1966, where it was well received and peaked at number eight. It was released in the US in December and was tapped as a potential \"chart winner\" by Billboard magazine.  Despite this it managed only a meager chart peak of 135—a sign of the band's flagging popularity in the American market. \n\nThe Kinks' next single was a social commentary piece, entitled \"Dead End Street\". It was released in November 1966 and became another UK Top 10 hit,  although it reached only number 73 in the United States. Melody Maker reviewer Bob Dawbarn praised Ray Davies' ability to create a song with \"some fabulous lyrics and a marvelous melody ... combined with a great production,\"  and music scholar Johnny Rogan described it as \"a kitchen sink drama without the drama—a static vision of working class stoicism\". One of the group's first promotional music videos was produced for the song. It was filmed on Little Green Street, a small 18th-century lane in north London, located off Highgate Road in Kentish Town. \n\nThe Kinks' next single, \"Waterloo Sunset\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo Station.  The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie.   Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\"  Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \"Waterloo Sunset\" lasted a mere ten hours;  Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\"  The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Makers chart),  and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \"the most beautiful song in the English language\",  and Allmusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era.\" \n\nThe songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound.  Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \"Death of a Clown\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \"Autumn Almanac\", in early October. Backed with \"Mister Pleasant\", the single became another Top 5 success for the group. Andy Miller points out that, despite its success, the single marks a turning point in the band's career—it would be their last entry into the UK Top Ten for three years: \"In retrospect, 'Autumn Almanac' marked the first hint of trouble for the Kinks. This glorious single, one of the greatest achievements of British 60s pop, was widely criticised at the time for being too similar to previous Davies efforts.\"Miller, Andy (2003). p. 15. Nick Jones of Melody Maker asked, \"Is it time that Ray stopped writing about grey suburbanites going about their fairly unemotional daily business? ... Ray works to a formula, not a feeling, and it's becoming rather boring.\" Disc jockey Mike Ahern called the song \"a load of old rubbish\". Dave's second solo single, \"Susannah's Still Alive\", was released in the UK on 24 November. It sold a modest 59,000 copies, but failed to reach the Top 10. Miller states that \"by the end of the year, the Kinks were rapidly sliding out of fashion.\" \n\nBeginning early in 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead focusing on work in the studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success.  The Kinks' next single, \"Wonderboy\", released in the spring of 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers.  Despite this, it became a favourite of John Lennon of The Beatles.  According to Ray Davies, \"Someone had seen John Lennon in a club and he kept on asking the disc jockey to play 'Wonder Boy' over and over again\".  However, the band's own opinion of the track was low—Pete Quaife later stated, \"[I] hated it ... it was horrible.\" In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his deeply personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called Village Green. In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was Peter Frampton's group The Herd. \"In general, the teenyboppers were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of \"We Want The Herd!\" during their brief appearances,\"  commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, \"It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward. ... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again.\" At the end of June, the Kinks released the single \"Days\", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. \"I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it,\" Ray said. \"I played it to Brian, who used to be our roadie, and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset. ... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone.\"  \"Days\" reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States. \n\nVillage Green eventually morphed into their next album, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, released in late 1968 in the UK. A collection of thematic vignettes of English town and hamlet life, it was assembled from songs written and recorded over the previous two years.  It was greeted with almost unanimously positive reviews from both UK and US rock critics, yet failed to sell strongly.  One factor in the album's initial commercial failure was the lack of a popular single. It did not include the moderately successful \"Days\"; \"Starstruck\" was released in North America and continental Europe, but was unsuccessful.   Though a commercial disappointment, Village Green (the project's original name was adopted as shorthand for the long album title) was embraced by the new underground rock press when it came out in January 1969 in the United States, where the Kinks began to acquire a reputation as a cult band.  In The Village Voice, a newly hired Robert Christgau called it \"the best album of the year so far\". The underground Boston paper Fusion published a review stating, \"the Kinks continue, despite the odds, the bad press and their demonstrated lot, to come across. ... Their persistence is dignified, their virtues are stoic. The Kinks are forever, only for now in modern dress.\" The record did not escape criticism, however. In the student paper California Tech, one writer commented that it was \"schmaltz rock ... without imagination, poorly arranged and a poor copy of The Beatles\". Although it sold only an estimated 100,000 copies worldwide on its initial release, it has since become the Kinks' best-selling original record. The album remains popular; in 2004, it was re-released in a 3-CD \"Deluxe\" edition and one of its tracks, \"Picture Book\", was featured in a popular Hewlett-Packard television commercial, helping to boost the album's popularity considerably. \n\nIn early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving.  The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks.   Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused.  Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.\n\nRay Davies travelled to Los Angeles, California, in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in America.  The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene.  Before their return to the United States, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire).  As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War.  The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go. \n\nThe band added keyboardist John Gosling to their line-up in early 1970; before this Nicky Hopkins, along with Ray, had done most of the session work on keyboards. In May 1970 Gosling debuted with the Kinks on \"Lola\", an account of a confused romantic encounter with a transvestite, that became both a UK and US Top 10 hit, helping return the Kinks to the public eye.  The lyrics originally contained the word \"Coca-Cola\", and as a result the BBC refused to broadcast the song, considering it to be in violation of their policy against product placement.  Part of the song was hastily re-recorded by Ray Davies, with the offending line changed to the generic \"cherry cola\", although in concert, the Kinks still used \"Coca-Cola\". Recordings of both versions of \"Lola\" exist.  The accompanying album Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One was released in November 1970. It was a critical and commercial success, charting in the Top 40 in America, making it their most successful album since the mid-1960s.   After the success of \"Lola\", the band went on to release Percy in 1971, a soundtrack album to a film of the same name about a penis transplant.  The album, which consisted largely of instrumentals, did not receive positive reviews. The band's US label, Reprise, declined to release it in America, precipitating a major dispute that contributed to the band's departure from the label. Directly after the release of the album, the band's contracts with Pye and Reprise expired.\n\nBefore the end of 1971, the Kinks signed a five-album deal with RCA Records and received a million-dollar advance, which helped fund the construction of their own recording studio, Konk.  Their debut for RCA, Muswell Hillbillies, was replete with the influence of music hall and traditional American musical styles, including country and bluegrass. It is often hailed as their last great record, though it was not as successful as its predecessors. It was named after Muswell Hill, where the Davies brothers were brought up, and contained songs focusing on working-class life and, again, the Davies' childhood. Muswell Hillbillies, despite positive reviews and high expectations, peaked at number 48 on the Record World chart and number 100 on the Billboard chart. It was followed in 1972 by a double album, Everybody's in Show-Biz, which consisted of both studio tracks and live numbers recorded during a two-night stand at Carnegie Hall.  The record featured the ballad \"Celluloid Heroes\" and the Caribbean-themed \"Supersonic Rocket Ship\", their last UK Top 20 hit for more than a decade. \"Celluloid Heroes\" is a bittersweet rumination on dead and fading Hollywood stars (Mickey Rooney was still alive), in which the narrator declares that he wishes his life were like a movie, \"because celluloid heroes never feel any pain ... and celluloid heroes never really die.\"  The album was moderately successful in the United States, peaking at number 47 in Record World and number 70 in Billboard. It marks the transition between the band's early 1970s rock material and the theatrical incarnation in which they immersed themselves for the next four years.\n\nTheatrical incarnation (1973–76) \n\nIn 1973, Ray Davies dived headlong into the theatrical style, beginning with the rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos.  In conjunction with the Preservation project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring the group as a theatrical troupe.\n\nRay Davies' marital problems during this period began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at White City Stadium he told the audience he was \"fucking sick of the whole thing\", and was retiring.    He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital.\n\nWith Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness as well as his depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies \"decided to work again ... I don't think he was totally better, and he's been a different person ever since.\" \n\nPreservation Act 1 (1973) and Preservation Act 2 (1974) received generally poor reviews.   The story on the albums involved an anti-hero called Mr Flash, and his rival and enemy Mr Black (played by Dave Davies during live shows), an ultra-purist and corporatist. Preservation Act 2 was the first album recorded at Konk Studio; from this point forward, virtually every Kinks studio recording was produced by Ray Davies at Konk.    The band embarked on an ambitious US tour throughout late 1974, adapting the Preservation story for stage. Musicologist Eric Weisbard: \"[Ray] Davies expanded the Kinks into a road troupe of perhaps a dozen costumed actors, singers and horn players. ... Smoother and tighter than on record, Preservation live proved funnier as well.\" \n\nDavies began another project for Granada Television, a musical called Starmaker.  After a broadcast with Ray Davies in the starring role and the Kinks as both back-up band and ancillary characters, the project eventually morphed into the concept album The Kinks Present a Soap Opera, released in May 1975, in which Ray Davies fantasised about what would happen if a rock star traded places with a \"normal Norman\" and took a 9–5 job.  In August 1975, the Kinks recorded their final theatrical work, Schoolboys in Disgrace, a backstory biography of Preservation's Mr Flash.  The record was a modest success, peaking at number 45 on the Billboard charts. The song \"Father Christmas\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \"Father Christmas\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio.  Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with Arista Records in 1976. With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band.\n\nReturn to commercial success (1977–85) \n\nJohn Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart.  After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project.  Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band.  In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\", which helped make the record another success for the band. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow.\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, bands such as the Jam (\"David Watts\"), the Pretenders (\"Stop Your Sobbing\", \"I Go to Sleep\") and the Knack (\"The Hard Way\") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases. In 1978, Van Halen covered \"You Really Got Me\" for their debut single, a Top 40 US hit, helping boost the band's commercial resurgence (the band later covered \"Where Have All the Good Times Gone\", another early Kinks song). The hard rock sound of Low Budget, released in 1979, helped make it the Kinks' second gold album and highest charting original album in America, where it peaked at number 11. In 1980, the group's third live album, One for the Road, was produced, along with a video of the same title, bringing the group's concert-drawing power to a peak that would last into 1983. Dave Davies also took advantage of the group's improved commercial standing to fulfill his decade-long ambitions to release albums of his solo work. The first was the eponymous Dave Davies in 1980. It was also known by its catalogue number \"AFL1-3603\" because of its cover art, which depicted Dave Davies as a leather-jacketed piece of price-scanning barcode. He produced another, less successful, solo album in 1981, Glamour.  \n\nThe next Kinks album, Give the People What They Want, was released in late 1981 and reached number 15 in the US.  The record attained gold status and featured the UK hit single \"Better Things\" as well as \"Destroyer\", a major Mainstream Rock hit for the group. To promote the album, the Kinks spent the end of 1981 and most of 1982 touring relentlessly, and played multiple sell-out concerts throughout Australia, Japan, England and America.  The tour culminated with a performance at the US Festival in San Bernardino, California, for a crowd of 205,000.  In spring 1983, the song \"Come Dancing\" became their biggest American hit since \"Tired of Waiting for You\", peaking at number six. It also became the group's first Top 20 hit in the UK since 1972, peaking at number 12 in the charts.  The accompanying album, State of Confusion, was another commercial success, reaching number 12 in the US, but, like all of the group's albums since 1967, it failed to chart in the UK.  Another single released from the record, \"Don't Forget to Dance\", became a US top 30 hit and minor UK chart entry.\n\nThe Kinks' second wave of popularity remained at a peak with State of Confusion, but that success began to fade, a trend that also affected their British rock contemporaries The Rolling Stones and The Who at the time.   During the second half of 1983, Ray Davies started work on an ambitious solo film project, Return to Waterloo, about a London commuter who daydreams that he is a serial murderer.   The film gave actor Tim Roth a significant early role. Davies' commitment to writing, directing and scoring the new work caused tension in his relationship with his brother.  Another problem was the stormy end of the relationship between Ray Davies and Chrissie Hynde.  The old feud between Dave Davies and drummer Mick Avory also re-ignited. Davies eventually refused to work with Avory, and called for him to be replaced by Bob Henrit, former drummer of Argent (of which Jim Rodford had also been a member). Avory left the band, and Henrit was brought in to take his place. Ray Davies, who was still on amiable terms with Avory, invited him to manage Konk Studios. Avory accepted, and continued to serve as a producer and occasional contributor on later Kinks albums.\n\nBetween the completion of Return to Waterloo and Avory's departure, the band had begun work on Word of Mouth, their final Arista album, released in November 1984. As a result it features Avory on three tracks, with Henrit and a drum machine on the rest.  Many of the songs also appeared as solo recordings on Ray Davies' Return to Waterloo soundtrack album. Word of Mouths lead track, \"Do It Again\", was released as a single in April 1985. It reached number 41 in the US, the band's last entry into the Billboard Hot 100. Coinciding with the album's release, the first three books on the Kinks were published: The Kinks: The Official Biography, by Jon Savage;   The Kinks Kronikles, by rock critic John Mendelsohn, who had overseen the 1972 The Kink Kronikles compilation album; and The Kinks—The Sound And The Fury (The Kinks—A Mental Institution in the US), by Johnny Rogan. \n\nDecline in popularity and split (1986–96) \n\nIn early 1986, the group signed with MCA Records in the United States and London Records in the UK. Their first album for the new labels, Think Visual, released later that year, was a moderate success, peaking at number 81 on the Billboard albums chart.  Songs like the ballad \"Lost and Found\" and \"Working at the Factory\" concerned blue-collar life on an assembly line, while the title track was an attack on the very MTV video culture from which the band had profited earlier in the decade.  The Kinks followed Think Visual in 1987 with another live album, The Road, which was a mediocre commercial and critical performer. In 1989, the Kinks released UK Jive, a commercial failure, making only a momentary entry into the album charts at number 122. MCA Records ultimately dropped them, leaving the Kinks without a label deal for the first time in over a quarter of a century. Longtime keyboardist Ian Gibbons left the group and was replaced by Mark Haley. \n\nIn 1990, their first year of eligibility, the Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Mick Avory and Pete Quaife were present for the award. The induction, however, did not revive the Kinks' stalled career. A compilation from the MCA Records period was produced in 1991, titled Lost & Found (1986-1989). It was primarily released to fulfill contractual obligations, and marked the official end of the group's relationship with MCA. The band then signed with Columbia Records and released the five-song EP Did Ya in 1991 which, despite being coupled with a new studio re-recording of the band's 1968 British hit \"Days\", failed to chart.\n\nThe Kinks reverted to a four-piece band for the recording of their first Columbia album, Phobia, in 1993.  Following Mark Haley's departure after the band's sellout performance at the Royal Albert Hall, London, Gibbons rejoined the Kinks for a US tour. Phobia managed only one week in the US Billboard chart at number 166; as had by then become usual for the band, it made no impression in the UK. One single, \"Only a Dream\", narrowly failed to reach the British chart. \"Scattered\", the album's final candidate for release as a single, was announced, followed by TV and radio promotion, but the record was unavailable in stores—several months later a small number appeared on the collector market. The group was dropped by Columbia in 1994. In the same year, the band released the first version of the album To the Bone on their own Konk label in the UK. This live acoustic album was partly recorded on the highly successful UK tours of 1993 and 1994 and partly in the Konk studio, before a small, invited audience.  Two years later the band released a new, improved, live double CD set in the USA, which retained the same name and contained two new studio tracks, \"Animal\" and \"To The Bone\". The CD set also featured new treatments of many old Kinks hits. The record drew respectable press but failed to chart in either the US or the UK.\n\nThe band's profile rose considerably in the mid-1990s, primarily as a result of the \"Britpop\" boom. Several of the most prominent bands of the decade cited the Kinks as a major influence. Blur frontman Damon Albarn and Oasis chief songwriter Noel Gallagher both described the Kinks as having a major impact on their songwriting as well as their overall development as musical artists. Gallagher declared the Kinks the fifth best band of all time.  Despite such accolades, the group's commercial viability continued to decline. They gradually became less active, leading Ray and Dave Davies to pursue their own interests. Each released an autobiography; Ray's X-Ray was published in early 1995, and Dave responded with his memoir Kink, published a year later.  The Kinks gave their last public performance in mid-1996,  and the group assembled for what would turn out to be their last time together at a party for Dave's 50th birthday. Kinks chronicler and historian Doug Hinman stated, \"The symbolism of the event was impossible to overlook. The party was held at the site of the brothers' very first musical endeavour, the Clissold Arms pub, across the street from their childhood home on Fortis Green in North London.\" \n\nSolo work and reunion (1997–present) \n\nThe band members subsequently focused on solo projects, and Ray and Dave released their own studio albums. Talk of a Kinks reunion circulated (including an aborted studio reunion of the original band members in 1999), but neither Ray nor Dave Davies showed much interest in playing together again. Meanwhile, former members John Gosling, John Dalton and Mick Avory had regrouped in 1994 and started performing on the oldies circuit along with guitar-player/singer Dave Clarke as The Kast Off Kinks.  Gosling and Dalton retired in 2008 and were replaced in the band by former Kinks members Jim Rodford and Ian Gibbons. Ray Davies, Pete Quaife and Bob Henrit have occasionally made guest appearances with the group at Kinks fan club conventions.\n\nRay Davies came out with the solo album Storyteller, a companion piece to X-Ray, in 1998. Originally written two years earlier as a cabaret-style show, it celebrated his old band and his estranged brother. Seeing the programming possibilities in his music/dialogue/reminiscence format, the American music television network VH1 launched a series of similar projects featuring established rock artists titled VH1 Storytellers.  Dave Davies spoke favourably of a Kinks reunion in early 2003, and as the 40th anniversary of the group's breakthrough neared, both of the Davies brothers expressed interest in working together again.  However, hopes for a reunion were dashed when in June 2004 Dave suffered a stroke while exiting an elevator, temporarily impairing his ability to speak and play guitar. Following Dave's recovery, the Kinks were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005, with all four of the original band members in attendance. The award was presented by The Who's guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend, a longtime Kinks fan and friend of Ray Davies.  The induction helped fuel sales for the group; in August 2007, a re-entry of The Ultimate Collection, a compilation of material spanning the band's career, reached number 32 on the UK Top 100 album chart and number one on the UK Indie album chart. \n\nIn December 2007, Record Collector published an interview with Ray Davies in which he said, \"I spoke to Quaife about a month ago and he dearly wants to make another record with me. I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. It would be great to get back together just to see what musical ideas we had, and what would happen.\"  The Daily Mail subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent.  Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that \"it would be like a bad remake of Night of the Living Dead\" and added, \"Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996.\" \n\nIn a September 2008 interview with BBC Radio 4, Ray Davies said of a possible reunion, \"There is a desire to do it\", but that he wouldn't participate if it were a nostalgia act: \"The thing that would make me decide 'yes' or 'no' would be whether or not we could do new songs\". He added that the main barrier to the band getting back together was his brother's condition following his stroke.  Two months later, he told the BBC that the band was beginning to write new material for a possible reunion, but failed to detail which members were involved.  In an interview aired that December on the Biography Channel, Quaife rejected any possibility that he would take part in a reunion.  That same month, Ray Davies spoke again about the possibility of performing with his brother: \"I suggested he do some low-key shows to see how well he can play. If we're going to play together again, we can't hit the road straight away with a big-time announcement. ... But, if Dave feels good about it and there's good new material that we can write, it'll happen.\" \n\nIn June 2009, Ray Davies told The Independent that while a full-fledged reunion was unlikely, \"I will continue to play with ex-band members like Mick Avory from time to time. With Dave, a lot of it is psychological. I’ll guide him in, and coerce and nurture him, and when the time is right I suppose I’ll even shout at him again.\" When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, \"A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well.\"  In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had \"eight tracks\" ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress.  It remains unclear who has been involved in the recordings besides Avory and Ray Davies.\n\nQuaife, who had been receiving kidney dialysis for more than ten years, died on 23 June 2010, aged 66.  Two days after the bassist's death, Dave Davies posted a statement on his message board expressing deep sorrow over the passing of his former band mate and stating that Quaife \"was never really given the credit he deserved for his contribution and involvement [with The Kinks]\".  Ray Davies dedicated his 27 June performance at the Glastonbury Festival to Quaife and performed several Quaife-era Kinks songs in tribute to him. Davies told the crowd, \"I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him.\" \n\nIn separate interviews early in 2011 both Davies brothers spoke positively about a potential reunion. Dave Davies explained, \"There's nothing in the pipeline yet, but...we'll see. It's possible.\" Each has said that any reunion would be dependent on the other. According to Ray Davies, the brothers were to meet in April to discuss future plans.    In October that year, Dave Davies quashed rumours of a reunion, stating in an interview that although he loves his brother, \"I just can’t stand to be with him. About an hour with Ray’s my limit, so it would be a very short reunion.\"   In November of that year Ray Davies reported that he had recently recorded with Avory \"just to sort of try to do what we call demos...we might do it in fits and starts and bring Dave in at a later date. I'll never say never with my brother, because he's totally unpredictable.\"  In a 2013 Skype interview Dave Davies expressed interest in doing reunions shows. \n\nOn 13 December 2013, it was officially confirmed that a musical named Sunny Afternoon, based on the early life of Ray Davies and the formation of the Kinks, would receive its world premiere at the Hampstead Theatre in April 2014.   The musical's name came from the band's 1966 hit single \"Sunny Afternoon\"  and features songs from the band's back catalogue. \n\nOn 18 December 2015, Ray Davies joined Dave Davies onstage at the Islington Assembly Hall in London to perform 'You Really Got Me'. Among other musicians they were backed up by Dennis Diken of the Smithereens on drums (he had played drums for a Kinks show in  Boston in the early 80s) and Debi Doss, one of the backing vocalists from Preservation Hall and Schoolboys in Disgrace. \n\nLive performances \n\nThe first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—\"The Pete Quaife Band\", \"The Bo-Weevils\", \"The Ramrods\", and \"The Ravens\"—before settling on \"The Kinks\" in early 1964.\n\nThe Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \"package\" bill that included Manfred Mann and The Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as The Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \"You Really Got Me\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years,  possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. \n\nIn April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. Davies went into a state of depression, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \"sick of it all\" at a gig in White City Stadium.  A review of the concert published in Melody Maker stated: \"Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F...... sick of the whole thing' ... He was 'Sick up to here with it' ... and those that heard shook their heads. Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer on through 'Waterloo Sunset. Davies proceeded to try to announce that the Kinks were breaking up, but this attempt was foiled by the group's publicity management, who pulled the plug on the microphone system.\n\nLegacy \n\nThe Kinks are regarded as one of the most important and influential rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s. Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the Kinks \"one of the most influential bands of the British Invasion\". They were ranked 65th on Rolling Stone magazine's \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" list. \n\nArtists influenced by the Kinks include punk rock groups such as the Ramones,   The Clash,  and The Jam, new wave and heavy metal acts like Van Halen and Britpop groups such as Oasis, Blur and Pulp. Craig Nicholls, singer and guitarist of The Vines has also named the Kinks as a key influence on his own songwriting, stating in one interview, \"They’re such great songwriters, so underrated, and they did so much great stuff later on. I’m obsessed with the Kinks.\"  Pete Townshend, guitarist with the Kinks' contemporaries the Who, was particularly influenced by the group's sound: \"the Kinks were ... quintessentially English. I always think that Ray Davies should one day be poet laureate. He invented a new kind of poetry and a new kind of language for pop writing that influenced me from the very, very, very beginning.\"  Jon Savage wrote that the Kinks were an influence on late-1960s American psychedelic groups, \"like the Doors, Love and Jefferson Airplane\".\n\nMusicologist Joe Harrington has described the Kinks' influence on the development of hard rock and heavy metal: \"You Really Got Me', 'All Day and All of the Night' and 'I Need You' were predecessors of the whole three-chord genre ... the Kinks did a lot to help turn rock 'n' roll (Jerry Lee Lewis) into rock (Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, the Stooges).\" \n\nCharts, sales certifications and recognition \n\nThe Kinks had five Top 10 singles on the US Billboard chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, the group had seventeen Top 20 singles along with five Top 10 albums. The RIAA has certified four of the Kinks' albums as gold records. Greatest Hits!, released in 1965, was certified gold for sales of $1,000,000 on 28 November 1968—six days after the release of The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society, which failed to chart worldwide.  The group would not receive another gold record award until 1979's Low Budget. The 1980 live album One For The Road was certified gold on 8 December 1980. Give The People What They Want, released in 1981, received its certification on 25 January 1982, for sales of 500,000 copies.  ASCAP, the performing-rights group, presented the Kinks with an award for \"One of the Most Played Songs Of 1983\" for the hit single \"Come Dancing\".\n\nThe group received the Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Service to British Music\", and in 1990 the original four members of the Kinks were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The Kinks were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005.\n\nMusical style \n\nThe Kinks started out playing the then popular R&B and blues styles, then, under the influence of The Kingsmen's \"Louie Louie\" recording, developed louder rock and hard rock sounds — due to their pioneering contribution to the field, they have often been labelled as \"the original punks\".   Dave Davies became bored with the traditional \"clean\" guitar style of the period; in search of a louder, more biting sound, he famously split the speaker cone of his Elpico amplifier (nicknamed \"the little green amp\"): \"I started to get really frustrated [with the amp's sound], and I said, 'I know! I'll fix you!' I got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut ... [from the centre to the edge of the] cone ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played and I thought it was amazing.\"  The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into a larger Vox AC30, and the resulting effect became a mainstay in the Kinks' early recordings—most notably on \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night\".\n\nFrom 1966 onwards, the Kinks came to be known for their adherence to traditions of English music and culture, during a period when many other British groups dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R&B and pop styles. Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. \"I decided I was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote 'Well Respected Man'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... [I also] abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent.\"  The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the American Federation of Musicians. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market, forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, fusing music hall and folk, and creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.\n\nBeginning with Everybody's In Show-biz (1972), Ray Davies began exploring theatrical concepts on the group's albums; these themes became manifest on the 1973 album Preservation Act 1 and continued through Schoolboys In Disgrace (1976). The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted to a traditional rock format throughout the remainder of the 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm. The band returned to hard rock for Low Budget (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.\n\nDocumentation, unreleased material and out-takes \n\nThe recording histories of contemporary acts were well-documented but little survived from studio archives of the Kinks' 1960s recording history.  Ray Davies kept a diary,  but he had, by 2004, not published it. Unlike larger record companies like EMI, Pye Records, kept few of the Kinks' session tapes, wiping or recording over most acetates and out-takes—by the mid-1980s. From 1971 – and the move to RCA – both documentation and tapes were preserved because, at their own Konk Studios, the Kinks kept creative licence – but \"until and unless there is some access to the vaults of Konk Studios, this aspect of the Kinks' recording legacy will remain far from definitive\", Doug Hinman wrote in 2004.  Later compilation releases, such as Picture Book, increasingly included previously-unreleased material and commentary.\n\nMembers \n\n* Ray Davies – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, harmonica, keyboards (1964–1996)\n* Dave Davies – lead guitar, backing and lead vocals (1964–1996)\n* Mick Avory – drums, percussion (1964–1984)\n* Bob Henrit – drums, percussion (1984–1996)\n* Pete Quaife – bass, backing vocals (1964–1969) (died 2010)\n* John Dalton – bass, backing vocals (June–1966, 1969–1976, 1978)\n* Andy Pyle – bass, backing vocals (1976–1978)\n* Jim Rodford – bass, backing vocals (1978–1996)\n* John Gosling – keyboards, piano, 1970–1978)\n* Gordon John Edwards – keyboards, piano (1978) (died 2002)\n* Ian Gibbons – keyboards, piano (1979–1989, 1993–1996)\n* Mark Haley – keyboards, piano (1989–1993)\n\nTimeline \n\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:1964 till:1996\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\n\nColors =\n  id:Vocals           value:red legend:Vocals\n  id:Guitar         value:green legend:Guitar\n  id:Keyboard       value:purple        legend:Keyboards\n  id:Bass           value:blue legend:Bass\n  id:Drums          value:orange      legend:Drums\n  id:album          value:black     legend:Albums\n  id:grid1          value:gray(0.3)\n  id:Tours          value:gray(0.5)\n\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:2 start:1964\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1964\n\nLineData =\n  layer:back color:album\n  at:10/02/1964\n  at:03/05/1965\n  at:11/26/1965\n  at:10/28/1966\n  at:09/15/1967\n  at:11/22/1968\n  at:10/10/1969\n  at:11/27/1970\n  at:11/24/1971\n  at:08/25/1972\n  at:11/16/1973\n  at:03/08/1974\n  at:03/16/1975\n  at:01/23/1976\n  at:02/25/1977\n  at:05/05/1978\n  at:07/10/1979\n  at:08/15/1981\n  at:06/10/1983\n  at:11/19/1984\n  at:11/17/1986\n  at:02/10/1989\n  at:03/29/1993\n\nBarData =\n  bar:IA text:\"Ray Davies\"\n  bar:MA text:\"Dave Davies\"\n  bar:CB text:\"Pete Quaife\"\n  bar:MB text:\"John Dalton\"\n  bar:BB text:\"Andy Pyle\"\n  bar:DP text:\"Jim Rodford\"\n  bar:JE text:\"John Gosling\"\n  bar:JC text:\"Gordon Edwards\"\n  bar:DAP text:\"Ian Gibbons\"\n  bar:PJV text:\"Mark Haley\"\n  bar:GC text:\"Mick Avory\"\n  bar:EJ text:\"Bob Henrit\"\n\nPlotData =\n  width:11\n  bar:IA from:01/11/1964 till:11/10/1996 color:Vocals\n  bar:IA from:01/11/1964 till:11/10/1996 color:Guitar width:3\n  bar:MA from:01/11/1964 till:11/10/1996 color:Guitar\n  bar:MA from:01/11/1964 till:11/10/1996 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:GC from:01/11/1964 till:07/10/1984 color:Drums\n  bar:EJ from:07/10/1984 till:12/12/1996 color:Drums\n  bar:CB from:01/11/1964 till:03/04/1966 color:Bass\n  bar:CB from:01/11/1964 till:03/04/1966 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:MB from:03/04/1966 till:12/12/1966 color:Bass\n  bar:MB from:03/04/1966 till:12/12/1966 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:CB from:12/12/1966 till:01/01/1969 color:Bass\n  bar:CB from:12/12/1966 till:01/01/1969 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:MB from:01/01/1969 till:11/08/1976 color:Bass\n  bar:MB from:01/01/1969 till:11/08/1976 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:JE from:01/01/1970 till:06/07/1978 color:Keyboard\n  bar:JE from:01/01/1970 till:06/07/1978 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:BB from:11/08/1976 till:03/02/1978 color:Bass\n  bar:BB from:11/08/1976 till:03/02/1978 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:MB from:03/02/1978 till:08/05/1978 color:Bass\n  bar:MB from:03/02/1978 till:08/05/1978 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:DP from:08/05/1978 till:11/10/1996 color:Bass\n  bar:DP from:08/05/1978 till:11/10/1996 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:JC  from:06/07/1978 till:12/30/1978 color:Keyboard\n  bar:JC  from:06/07/1978 till:12/30/1978 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:DAP  from:04/15/1979 till:04/10/1989 color:Keyboard\n  bar:DAP  from:04/15/1979 till:04/10/1989 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:PJV  from:04/10/1989 till:09/15/1992 color:Keyboard\n  bar:PJV  from:04/10/1989 till:09/15/1992 color:Vocals width:3\n  bar:DAP  from:03/24/1993 till:11/10/1996 color:Keyboard\n  bar:DAP  from:03/24/1993 till:11/10/1996 color:Vocals width:3\n\nDiscography \n\nThe Kinks were active for more than 30 years between 1964 and 1996, releasing 28 regular albums in the UK (24 studio, four live), and 30 in the USA (24 studio, four live, two compilation). The early 1960s US albums were slightly different to the British albums partly due to the method that publishing royalties were calculated in the two countries,  partly due to difference in popularity of the extended play format (the UK market liked it, the US market didn't, so US albums had the EP releases bundled onto them), and partly due to the US albums including the hit singles, and the UK albums not; after The Kink Kontroversy in 1965 the albums were the same. There have been somewhere between 100 and 200 compilation albums released worldwide.   Their hit singles include three UK number-one singles, starting in 1964 with \"You Really Got Me\"; plus 18 Top 40 singles in the 1960s alone and further Top 40 hits in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n;Studio albums\n\n* Kinks (1964)\n* Kinda Kinks (1965)\n* The Kink Kontroversy (1965)\n* Face to Face (1966)\n* Something Else by The Kinks (1967)\n* The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society (1968)\n* Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) (1969)\n* Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One (1970)\n* Percy (1971)\n* Muswell Hillbillies (1971)\n* Everybody's in Show-Biz (1972)\n* Preservation Act 1 (1973)\n* Preservation Act 2 (1974)\n* Soap Opera (1975)\n* Schoolboys in Disgrace (1975)\n* Sleepwalker (1977)\n* Misfits (1978)\n* Low Budget (1979)\n* Give the People What They Want (1981)\n* State of Confusion (1983)\n* Word of Mouth (1984)\n* Think Visual (1986)\n* UK Jive (1989)\n* Phobia (1993)\n\n;Live albums\n* Live at Kelvin Hall (1967)\n* One for the Road (1980)\n* Live: The Road (1988)\n* To the Bone (1994)\n\n;UK/US Top ten singles\n\n* \"You Really Got Me\" (1964) UK & US\n* \"All Day and All of the Night\" (1964) UK & US\n* \"Tired of Waiting for You\" (1965) UK & US\n* \"Set Me Free\" (1965) UK\n* \"See My Friends\" (1965) UK\n* \"Till the End of the Day\" (1965) UK\n* \"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\" (1966) UK\n* \"Sunny Afternoon\" (1966) UK\n* \"Dead End Street\" (1966) UK\n* \"Waterloo Sunset\" (1967) UK\n* \"Lola\" (1970) UK & US\n* \"Apeman\" (1970) UK\n* \"Come Dancing\" (1982) US",
                "The Who are an English rock band that formed in 1964. Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bass guitarist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide and holding a reputation for their live shows and studio work.\n\nThe Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can't Explain\", reached the UK top ten, followed by a string of singles including \"My Generation\", \"Substitute\" and \"Happy Jack\". In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single \"I Can See for Miles\", while touring extensively. The group's fourth album, 1969's rock opera Tommy, included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success. Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival, along with the live album Live at Leeds, cemented their reputation as a respected rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter and visionary Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up 1971's Who's Next, which included the hit \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". The group released the album Quadrophenia in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy in 1975. They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after.\n\nKenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed activity, releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1982. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996–97. They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing Endless Wire in 2006, and continued to play live regularly.\n\nThe Who's major contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large PA systems, use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's lead playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by hard rock, punk rock and mod bands, and their songs still receive regular exposure.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nThe founding members of the Who, Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend and John Entwistle, grew up in Acton, London and went to Acton County Grammar School. Townshend's father, Cliff, played saxophone and his mother, Betty, had sung in the entertainment division of the Royal Air Force during World War II, and both supported their son's interest in rock and roll. Townshend and Entwistle became friends in their second year of Acton County, and formed a trad jazz group; Entwistle also played French horn in the Middlesex Schools' Symphony Orchestra. Both were interested in rock, and Townshend particularly admired Cliff Richard's début single, \"Move It\". Entwistle moved to guitar, but struggled with it due to his large fingers, and moved to bass on hearing the guitar work of Duane Eddy. He was unable to afford a bass and built one at home. After Acton County, Townshend attended Ealing Art College, a move he later described as profoundly influential on the course of the Who.\n\nDaltrey, who was in the year above, had moved to Acton from Shepherd's Bush, a more working-class area. He had trouble fitting in at the school, and discovered gangs and rock and roll. He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site. In 1959 he started the Detours, the band that was to evolve into the Who. The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept a close eye on the finances as well as the music.\n\nDaltrey spotted Entwistle by chance on the street carrying a bass and recruited him into the Detours. In mid-1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as a guitarist, Daltrey on lead guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums, and Colin Dawson on vocals.  The band played instrumentals by the Shadows and the Ventures, and a variety of pop and trad jazz covers. Daltrey was considered the leader and, according to Townshend, \"ran things the way he wanted them\". Wilson was fired in mid-1962 and replaced by Doug Sandom, though he was older than the rest of the band, married, and a more proficient musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years.\n\nDawson left after frequently arguing with Daltrey and after being briefly replaced by Gabby Connolly, Daltrey moved to lead vocals. Townshend, with Entwistle's encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend's mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce, who started booking the band as a support act. The Detours were influenced by the bands they supported, including Screaming Lord Sutch, Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, Shane Fenton and the Fentones, and Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. The Detours were particularly interested in the Pirates as they also only had one guitarist, Mick Green, who inspired Townshend to combine rhythm and lead guitar in his style.  Entwistle's bass became more of a lead instrument, playing melodies. In February 1964, the Detours became aware of the group Johnny Devlin and the Detours and changed their name. Townshend and his room-mate Richard Barnes spent a night considering names, focusing on a theme of joke announcements, including \"No One\" and \"the Group\". Townshend preferred \"the Hair\", and Barnes liked \"the Who\" because it \"had a pop punch\". Daltrey chose \"the Who\" the next morning.\n\n1964–78\n\nEarly career\n\nBy the time the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, including at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square. They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for Fontana Records. Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not speak to each other again for 14 years.\n\nDuring a gig with a stand-in drummer in late April at the Oldfield, the band first met Keith Moon. Moon grew up in Wembley, and had been drumming in bands since 1961. He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time. Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job. Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.\n\nThe Who changed managers to Peter Meaden. He decided that the group would be ideal to represent the growing mod movement in Britain which involved fashion, scooters and music genres such as rhythm and blues, soul and beat. He renamed the group the High Numbers, dressed them up in mod clothes,  secured a second, more favourable audition with Fontana and wrote the lyrics for both sides of their single \"Zoot Suit\"/\"I'm the Face\" to appeal to mods. The tune for \"Zoot Suit\" was \"Misery\" by the Dynamics,  and \"I'm the Face\" borrowed from Slim Harpo's \"I Got Love If You Want It\". Although Meaden tried to promote the single, it failed to reach the top 50 and the band reverted to calling themselves the Who. The group began to improve their stage image; Daltrey started using his microphone cable as a whip on stage, and occasionally leapt into the crowd; Moon threw drumsticks into the air mid-beat; Townshend mimed machine gunning the crowd with his guitar while jumping on stage and playing guitar with a fast arm-windmilling motion, or stood with his arms aloft allowing his guitar to produce feedback in a posture dubbed \"the Bird Man\".\n\nMeaden was replaced as manager by two filmmakers, Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. They were looking for a young, unsigned rock group that they could make a film about,  and had seen the band at the Railway Hotel in Wealdstone, which had become a regular venue for them.  Lambert related to Townshend and his art school background, and encouraged him to write songs. In August, Lambert and Stamp made a promotional film featuring the group and their audience at the Railway. The band changed their set towards soul, rhythm and blues and Motown covers, and created the slogan \"Maximum R&B\".\n\nIn June 1964, during a performance at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke the head of his guitar on the low ceiling of the stage.  Angered by the audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who's live set.\n\nFirst singles and My Generation\n\nBy late 1964, the Who were becoming popular in London's Marquee club, and a rave review of their live act appeared in Melody Maker. Lambert and Stamp attracted the attention of the American producer Shel Talmy, who had produced the Kinks. Townshend had written a song, \"I Can't Explain\", that deliberately sounded like the Kinks to attract Talmy's attention. Talmy saw the group in rehearsals and was impressed. He signed them to his production company, and sold the recording to the US arm of Decca Records, which meant that the group's early singles were released in Britain on Brunswick Records, one of UK Decca's labels for US artists. \"I Can't Explain\" was recorded in early November 1964 at Pye Studios in Marble Arch with the Ivy League on backing vocals, and Jimmy Page played fuzz guitar on the B-side, \"Bald Headed Woman\".\n\n\"I Can't Explain\" became popular with pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline. Pirate radio was important for bands as there were no commercial radio stations in the UK and BBC Radio played little pop music. The group gained further exposure when they appeared on the television programme Ready Steady Go! Lambert and Stamp were tasked with finding \"typical teens\", and invited the group's regular audience from the Goldhawk Social Club.  Enthusiastic reception on television and regular airplay on pirate radio helped the single slowly climb the charts in early 1965 until it reached the top 10. The follow-up single, \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\", by Townshend and Daltrey, features guitar noises such as pick sliding, toggle switching and feedback, which was so unconventional that it was initially rejected by the US arm of Decca. The single reached the top 10 in the UK and was used as the theme song to Ready Steady Go!\n\nThe transition to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did not sit well with Daltrey, and a recording session of R&B covers went unreleased. The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the West End of London. The group experienced a difficult time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's amphetamines down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked, but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted Richard Cole as a roadie.\n\nThe next single, \"My Generation\", followed in October. Townshend had written it as a slow blues, but after several abortive attempts, it was turned into a more powerful song with a bass solo from Entwistle. The song used gimmicks such as a vocal stutter to simulate the speech of a mod on amphetamines, and two key changes. Townshend insisted in interviews that the lyrics \"Hope I die before I get old\" were not meant to be taken literally. Peaking at No. 2, \"My Generation\" is the group's highest-charting single in the UK. The début album My Generation was released in late 1965. Among original material by Townshend, including the title track and \"The Kids Are Alright\", the album has several James Brown covers from the session earlier that year that Daltrey favoured. \n\nAfter My Generation, the Who fell out with Talmy, which meant an abrupt end to their recording contract.  The resulting legal acrimony resulted in Talmy holding the rights to the master tapes, which prevented the album from being reissued until 2002. The Who were signed to Robert Stigwood's label, Reaction, and released \"Substitute\". Townshend said he wrote the song about identity crisis, and as a parody of the Rolling Stones's \"19th Nervous Breakdown\". It was the first single to feature him playing an acoustic twelve-string guitar. Talmy took legal action over the B-side, \"Instant Party\", and the single was withdrawn. A new B-side, \"Waltz for a Pig\", was recorded by the Graham Bond Organisation under the pseudonym \"the Who Orchestra\".\n\nIn 1966 the Who released \"I'm a Boy\", about a boy dressed as a girl, taken from an abortive collection of songs called Quads; \"Happy Jack\"; and an EP, Ready Steady Who, that tied in with their regular appearances on Ready Steady Go! The group continued to have conflict; on 20 May, Moon and Entwistle were late to a gig having been on the Ready Steady Go! set with The Beach Boys' Bruce Johnston. During \"My Generation\", Townshend attacked Moon with his guitar; Moon suffered a black eye and bruises, and he and Entwistle left the band, but changed their minds and rejoined a week later. Moon kept looking for other work, and Jeff Beck had him to play drums on his song \"Beck's Bolero\" (with Page, John Paul Jones and Nicky Hopkins) because he was \"trying to get Keith out of the Who\".\n\nA Quick One and The Who Sell Out\n\nTo alleviate financial pressure on the band, Lambert arranged a song-writing deal which required each member to write two songs for the next album. Entwistle contributed \"Boris the Spider\" and \"Whiskey Man\" and found a niche role as second songwriter. The band found they needed to fill an extra ten minutes, and Lambert encouraged Townshend to write a longer piece, \"A Quick One, While He's Away\". The suite of song fragments is about a girl who has an affair while her lover is away, but is ultimately forgiven. The album was titled A Quick One (Happy Jack in the US),  and reached No. 4 in the UK charts. It was followed in 1967 by the UK Top 5 single \"Pictures of Lily\".\n\nBy 1966, Ready Steady Go! had ended, the mod movement was becoming unfashionable, and the Who found themselves in competition on the London circuit with groups including Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Lambert and Stamp realised that commercial success in the US was paramount to the group's future, and arranged a deal with promoter Frank Barsalona for a short package tour in New York. The group's performances, which still involved smashing guitars and kicking over drums, were well received, and led to their first major US appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival. The group, especially Moon, were not fond of the hippie movement, and thought their violent stage act would stand in sharp contrast to the peaceful atmosphere of the festival. Hendrix was also on the bill, and was also going to smash his guitar on stage. Townshend verbally abused Hendrix and accused him of stealing his act, and the pair argued about who should go on stage first, with the Who winning the argument. The Who brought hired equipment to the festival; Hendrix shipped over his regular touring gear from Britain, including a full Marshall stack. According to biographer Tony Fletcher, Hendrix sounded \"so much better than the Who it was embarrassing\". The Who's appearance at Monterey gave them recognition in the US, and \"Happy Jack\" reached the top 30.\n\nThe group followed Monterey with a US tour supporting Herman's Hermits. The Hermits were a straightforward pop band and enjoyed drugs and practical jokes. They bonded with Moon, who was excited to learn that cherry bombs were legal to purchase in Alabama. Moon acquired a reputation of destroying hotel rooms while on tour, with a particular interest in blowing up toilets. Entwistle said the first cherry bomb they tried \"blew a hole in the suitcase and the chair\". Moon recalled his first attempt to flush one down the toilet: \"[A]ll that porcelain flying through the air was quite unforgettable. I never realised dynamite was so powerful.\" After a gig in Flint, Michigan on Moon's 21st birthday on 23 August 1967, the entourage caused $24,000 of damage at the hotel, and Moon knocked out one of his front teeth. Daltrey later said that the tour brought the band closer, and as the support act, they could turn up and perform a short show without any major responsibilities.\n\nAfter the Hermits tour, the Who recorded their next single, \"I Can See for Miles\", which Townshend had written in 1966 but had avoided recording until he was sure it could be produced well.  Townshend called it \"the ultimate Who record\", and was disappointed it reached only No. 10 in the UK. It became their best selling single in the US, reaching No. 9. The group toured the US again with Eric Burdon and the Animals, including an appearance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, miming to \"I Can See For Miles\" and \"My Generation\". Moon bribed a stage hand to put explosives in his drum kit, who loaded it with ten times the expected quantity. The resulting detonation threw Moon off his drum riser and his arm was cut by flying cymbal shrapnel. Townshend's hair was singed and his left ear left ringing, and a camera and studio monitor were destroyed.\n\nThe next album was The Who Sell Out—a concept album paying tribute to pirate radio, which had been outlawed in August 1967 by the Marine, &c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967. It included humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs, a mini rock opera called \"Rael\", and \"I Can See For Miles\". The Who declared themselves a pop art group and thus viewed advertising as an artform; they recorded a wide variety of radio advertisements, such as for canned milkshakes and the American Cancer Society, in defiance of the rising anti-consumerist ethos of the hippie counterculture. Townshend stated, \"We don't change offstage. We live pop art.\"\n\nLater that year, Lambert and Stamp formed a record label, Track Records, with distribution by Polydor. As well as signing Hendrix, Track became the imprint for all the Who's UK output until the mid-1970s.\n\nThe group started 1968 by touring Australia and New Zealand with the Small Faces. The groups had trouble with the local authorities and the New Zealand Truth called them \"unwashed, foul-smelling, booze-swilling no-hopers\".  They continued to tour across the US and Canada during the first half of the year.\n\nTommy, Woodstock and Live at Leeds\n\nBy 1968 the Who had started to attract attention in the underground press. Townshend had stopped using drugs and became interested in the teachings of Meher Baba. In August, he gave an interview to Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner describing in detail the plot of a new album project and its relationship to Baba's teachings. The album went through several names during recording, including Deaf Dumb and Blind Boy and Amazing Journey; Townshend settled on Tommy for the album about the life of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and his attempt to communicate with others.  Some songs, such as \"Welcome\" and \"Amazing Journey\" were inspired by Baba's teaching, and others came from observations within the band. \"Sally Simpson\" is about a fan who tried to climb on stage at a gig by the Doors that they attended and \"Pinball Wizard\" was written so that New York Times journalist Nik Cohn, a pinball enthusiast, would give the album a good review. Townshend later said, \"I wanted the story of Tommy to have several levels ... a rock singles level and a bigger concept level\", containing the spiritual message he wanted as well as being entertaining. The album was projected for a Christmas 1968 release but recording stalled after Townshend decided to make a double album to cover the story in sufficient depth.\n\nBy the end of the year, 18 months of touring had led to a well-rehearsed and tight live band, which was evident when they performed \"A Quick One While He's Away\" at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus television special. The Stones considered their own performance lacklustre, and the project was never broadcast. The Who had not released an album in over a year, and had not completed the recording of Tommy, which continued well into 1969, interspersed with gigs at weekends. Lambert was a key figure in keeping the group focused and getting the album completed, and typed up a script to help them understand the story and how the songs fitted together.\n\nThe album was released in May with the accompanying single, \"Pinball Wizard\", a début performance at Ronnie Scott's, and a tour, playing most of the new album live. Tommy sold 200,000 copies in the US in its first two weeks, and was a critical smash, Life saying, \"... for sheer power, invention and brilliance of performance, Tommy outstrips anything which has ever come out of a recording studio\".  Melody Maker declared: \"Surely the Who are now the band against which all others are to be judged.\"  Daltrey had significantly improved as a singer, and set a template for rock singers in the 1970s by growing his hair long and wearing open shirts on stage. Townshend had taken to wearing a boiler suit and Doctor Martens shoes.\n\nIn August, the Who performed at the Woodstock Festival, despite being reluctant and demanding $13,000 up front. The group were scheduled to appear on Saturday night, 16 August, but the festival ran late and they did not take to the stage until 5am on Sunday; they played most of Tommy.  During their performance, Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman interrupted the set to give a political speech about the arrest of John Sinclair; Townshend kicked him off stage, shouting: \"Fuck off my fucking stage!\" During \"See Me, Feel Me\", the sun rose almost as if on cue; Entwistle later said, \"God was our lighting man\". At the end, Townshend threw his guitar into the audience.  The set was professionally recorded and filmed, and portions appear on the Woodstock film, The Old Grey Whistle Test and The Kids Are Alright.\n\nWoodstock has been regarded as culturally significant, but the Who were critical of the event. Roadie John \"Wiggie\" Wolff, who arranged the band's payment, described it as \"a shambles\". Daltrey declared it as \"the worst gig  ever played\" and Townshend said, \"I thought the whole of America had gone mad.\" A more enjoyable appearance came a few weeks later at the second Isle of Wight Festival, which Townshend described as \"a great concert for\" the band.\n\nBy 1970, the Who were widely considered one of the best and most popular live rock bands; Chris Charlesworth described their concerts as \"leading to a kind of rock nirvana that most bands can only dream about\". They decided a live album would help demonstrate how different the sound at their gigs was to Tommy, and set about listening to the hours of recordings they had accumulated. Townshend baulked at the prospect of doing so, and demanded that all the tapes be burned. Instead, they booked two shows, one in Leeds on 14 February, and one in Hull the following day, with the intention of recording a live album. Technical problems from the Hull gig resulted in the Leeds gig being used, which became Live at Leeds.  The album is viewed by several critics including The Independent,   The Telegraph  and the BBC,  as one of the best live rock albums of all time.\n\nThe Tommy tour included shows in European opera houses and saw the Who become the first rock act to play at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. In March the Who released the UK top 20 hit \"The Seeker\", continuing a theme of issuing singles separate to albums. Townshend wrote the song to commemorate the common man, as a contrast to the themes on Tommy.\n\nLifehouse and Who's Next\n\nTommy secured the Who's future, and made them millionaires. The group reacted in different ways—Daltrey and Entwistle lived comfortably, Townshend was embarrassed at his wealth, which he felt was at odds with Meher Baba's ideals, and Moon spent frivolously.\n\nDuring the latter part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a multi-media project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse.\n\nEntwistle was the first member of the group to release a solo album, Smash Your Head Against the Wall, in May 1971.\n\nRecording at the Record Plant in New York City in March 1971 was abandoned when Lambert's addiction to hard drugs interfered with his ability to produce. The group restarted with Glyn Johns in April.  The album was mostly Lifehouse material, with one unrelated song by Entwistle, \"My Wife\", and was released as Who's Next in August. The album reached No. 1 in the UK and the US. \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" are early examples of synthesizer use in rock, featuring keyboard sounds generated in real time by a Lowrey organ; on \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", it was further processed through a VCS3 synthesizer. The synthesizer intro to \"Baba O'Riley\" was programmed based on Meher Baba's vital stats, and the track featured a violin solo by Dave Arbus.  The album was a critical and commercial success, and has been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA.  The Who continued to issue Lifehouse-related material over the next few years, including the singles \"Let's See Action\", \"Join Together\" and \"Relay\".  \n\nThe band went back on tour, and \"Baba O' Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" became live favourites. In November they performed at the newly opened Rainbow Theatre in London for three nights,  continuing in the US later that month, where Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times described the Who as \"the Greatest Show on Earth\". The tour was slightly disrupted at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on 12 December when Moon passed out over his kit after overdosing on brandy and barbiturates. He recovered and completed the gig, playing to his usual strength.\n\nQuadrophenia, Tommy film and The Who by Numbers\n\nAfter touring Who's Next, and needing time to write a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group activity until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, and a desire to party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp.  Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.\n\nBy 1973, the Who turned to recording the album Quadrophenia about mod and its subculture, set against clashes with Rockers in early 1960s Britain. The story is about a boy named Jimmy, who undergoes a personality crisis, and his relationship with his family, friends and mod culture. The music features four themes, reflecting the four personalities of the Who.  Townshend played multi-tracked synthesizers, and Entwistle played several overdubbed horn parts. By the time the album was being recorded, relationships between the band and Lambert and Stamp had broken down irreparably, and Bill Curbishley replaced them. The album was the Who's highest charting, peaking at No. 2 in both the UK and US.\n\nThe Quadrophenia tour started in Stoke on Trent in October and was immediately beset with problems. Daltrey resisted Townshend's wish to add Joe Cocker's keyboardist Chris Stainton (who played on the album) to the touring band. As a compromise, Townshend assembled the keyboard and synthesizer parts on backing tapes, as such a strategy had been successful with \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". Unfortunately, the technology was not sophisticated enough to deal with the demands of the music; added to this issue, tour rehearsals had been interrupted due to an argument that culminated in Daltrey punching Townshend and knocking him out cold. At a gig in Newcastle, the tapes completely malfunctioned, and an enraged Townshend dragged sound-man Bob Pridden on-stage, screamed at him, kicked all the amps over and partially destroyed the backing tapes. The show was abandoned for an \"oldies\" set, at the end of which Townshend smashed his guitar and Moon kicked over his drumkit. The Independent described this gig as one of the worst of all time.  The US tour started on 20 November at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California; Moon passed out during \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" and during \"Magic Bus\". Townshend asked the audience, \"Can anyone play the drums?—I mean somebody good.\" An audience member, Scot Halpin, filled in for the rest of the show. After a show in Montreal, the band (except for Daltrey, who retired to bed early) caused so much damage to their hotel room, including destroying an antique painting and ramming a marble table through a wall, that federal law enforcement arrested them.\n\nBy 1974, work had begun in earnest on a Tommy film. Stigwood suggested Ken Russell as director, whose previous work Townshend had admired. The film featured a star-studded cast, including the band members. David Essex auditioned for the title role, but the band persuaded Daltrey to take it. The cast included Ann-Margret, Oliver Reed, Eric Clapton, Tina Turner, Elton John and Jack Nicholson. Townshend and Entwistle worked on the soundtrack for most of the year, handling the bulk of the instrumentation. Moon had moved to Los Angeles, so they used session drummers, including Kenney Jones. Elton John used his own band for \"Pinball Wizard\". Filming was from April until August. 1500 extras appeared in the \"Pinball Wizard\" sequence.\n\nThe film premièred on 18 March 1975 to a standing ovation. Townshend was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Tommy was shown at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, but not in the main competition. It won the award for Rock Movie of the Year in the First Annual Rock Music Awards and generated over $2 million in its first month. The soundtrack reached number two on the Billboard charts.\n\nWork on Tommy took up most of 1974, and live performances by the Who were restricted to a show in May at the Valley, the home of Charlton Athletic, in front of 80,000 fans, and a few dates at Madison Square Garden in June. Towards the end of the year, the group released the out-takes album Odds & Sods, which featured several songs from the aborted Lifehouse project.\n\nIn 1975, Daltrey and Townshend disagreed about the band's future and criticised each other via interviews in the music paper New Musical Express. Daltrey was grateful that the Who had saved him from a career as a sheet-metal worker and was unhappy at Townshend not playing well; Townshend felt the commitment of the group prevented him from releasing solo material. The next album, The Who by Numbers, had introspective songs from Townshend that dealt with disillusionment such as \"However Much I Booze\" and \"How Many Friends\"; they resembled his later solo work. Entwistle's \"Success Story\" gave a humorous look at the music industry, and \"Squeeze Box\" was a hit single. The group toured from October, playing little new material and few Quadrophenia numbers, and reintroducing several from Tommy. On 6 December 1975, the Who set the record for largest indoor concert at the Pontiac Silverdome, attended by 78,000. On 31 May 1976, they played a second concert at the Valley which was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's loudest concert at over 120 dB. Townshend had become fed up of touring but Entwistle considered live performance to be at a peak.\n\nWho Are You and Moon's death\n\nAfter the 1976 tour, Townshend took most of the following year off to spend time with his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, Who Are You.\n\nThe group reconvened in September 1977, but Townshend announced there would be no live performances for the immediate future, a decision that Daltrey endorsed. By this point, Moon was so unhealthy that the Who conceded it would be difficult for him to cope with touring. The only gig that year was an informal show on 15 December at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, London, filmed for the documentary, The Kids Are Alright. The band had not played for 14 months, and their performance was so weak that the footage was unused. Moon's playing was particularly lacklustre and he had gained a lot of weight, though Daltrey later said, \"even at his worst, Keith Moon was amazing.\" \n\nRecording of Who Are You started in January 1978. Daltrey clashed with Johns over the production of his vocals, and Moon's drumming was so poor that Daltrey and Entwistle considered firing him. Moon's playing improved, but on one track, \"Music Must Change\", he was replaced as he could not play in 6/8 time. In May, the Who filmed another performance at Shepperton Sound Studios for The Kids Are Alright. This performance was strong, and several tracks were used in the film. It was the last gig Moon performed with the Who.\n\nThe album was released on 18 August, and became their biggest and fastest seller to date, peaking at No. 6 in the UK and No. 2 in the US. Instead of touring, Daltrey, Townshend and Moon did a series of promotional television interviews, and Entwistle worked on the soundtrack for The Kids Are Alright.\n\nOn 6 September, Moon attended a party held by Paul McCartney to celebrate Buddy Holly's birthday. Returning to his flat, Moon took 32 tablets of clomethiazole which had been prescribed to combat his alcohol withdrawal. He passed out the following morning and was discovered dead later that day.\n\n1978–83\n\nThe day after Moon's death, Townshend issued the statement: \"We are more determined than ever to carry on, and we want the spirit of the group to which Keith contributed so much to go on, although no human being can ever take his place.\" Kenney Jones, of the Small Faces and the Faces, replaced Moon in November 1978. John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick joined the live band as an unofficial keyboardist. On 2 May 1979, the Who returned to the stage with a concert at the Rainbow Theatre, followed by the Cannes Film Festival in France and dates at Madison Square Garden in New York.\n\nThe Quadrophenia film was released that year. It was directed by Franc Roddam in his feature-directing début, and had straightforward acting rather than musical numbers as in Tommy. John Lydon was considered as Jimmy, but the role went to Phil Daniels. Sting played Jimmy's friend and fellow mod, the Ace Face.  The soundtrack was Jones' first appearance on a Who record, performing on newly written material not on the original album.  The film was a critical and box office success in the UK and appealed to the growing mod revival movement. The Jam were influenced by the Who, and critics noticed a similarity between Townshend and the group's leader, Paul Weller.\n\nThe Kids Are Alright was also completed in 1979. It was a retrospective of the band's career, directed by Jeff Stein. The film included footage of the band at Monterey, Woodstock and Pontiac, and clips from the Smothers Brothers' show and Russell Harty Plus. Moon had died one week after seeing the rough cut with Daltrey. The film contains the Shepperton concert, and an audio track of him playing over silent footage of himself was the last time he ever played the drums.\n\nIn December, the Who became the third band, after the Beatles and the Band, to grace the cover of Time. The article, by Jay Cocks, said the band had \"outpaced, outlasted, outlived and outclassed\" all of their rock band contemporaries. \n\nCincinnati tragedy\n\nOn 3 December 1979, a crowd crush at a Who gig at the Riverfront Coliseum, Cincinnati killed 11 fans.  This was partly due to the festival seating, where the first to enter get the best positions. Some fans waiting outside mistook the band's soundcheck for the concert, and attempted to force their way inside. As only a few entrance doors were opened, a bottleneck situation ensued with thousands trying to gain entry, and the crush became deadly.\n\nThe Who were not told until after the show because civic authorities feared crowd problems if the concert were cancelled. The band were deeply shaken upon learning of it and requested that appropriate safety precautions be taken in the future. The following evening, in Buffalo, New York, Daltrey told the crowd that the band had \"lost a lot of family last night and this show's for them\". \n\nChange and break-up\n\nDaltrey took a break in 1980 to work on the film McVicar, in which he took the lead role of bank robber John McVicar. The soundtrack album is a Daltrey solo album, though all members of the Who are included in the supporting musicians, and was his most successful solo release. \n\nThe Who released two studio albums with Jones as drummer, Face Dances (1981) and It's Hard (1982). Face Dances produced a US top 20 and UK top ten hit with the single \"You Better You Bet\", whose video was one of the first shown on MTV.  Both Face Dances and It's Hard sold well and the latter received a five-star review in Rolling Stone.  The single \"Eminence Front\" from It's Hard was a hit, and became a regular at live shows. \n\nBy this time Townshend had fallen into depression, wondering if he was no longer a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' drumming style was very different from Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982.\n\nTownshend wanted the Who to stop touring and become a studio act; Entwistle threatened to quit, saying, \"I don't intend to get off the road ... there's not much I can do about it except hope they change their minds.\" Townshend did not change his mind, and so the Who embarked on a farewell tour of the US and Canada  with the Clash as support,  ending in Toronto on 17 December. \n\nTownshend spent part of 1983 writing material for a studio album owed to Warner Bros. Records from a contract in 1980, but Townshend found himself unable and at the end of 1983 paid for himself and Jones to be released from the contract. He focused on solo albums such as White City: A Novel (1985), The Iron Man (1989, featuring Daltrey and Entwistle and two songs credited to the Who), and Psychoderelict (1993). \n\nReunions\n\nIn July 1985, the Who performed at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London.  The BBC transmission truck blew a fuse during the set, temporarily interrupting the broadcast.  At the 1988 Brit Awards, at the Royal Albert Hall, the band was given the British Phonographic Industry's Lifetime Achievement Award.  The short set they played there was the last time Jones played with the Who. \n\n1989 tour\n\nIn 1989, the band embarked on a 25th-anniversary The Kids Are Alright reunion tour with Simon Phillips on drums and Steve \"Boltz\" Bolton as a second guitarist. Townshend had announced in 1987 that he suffered from tinnitus   and alternated acoustic, rhythm, and lead guitar to preserve his hearing. Their two shows at Sullivan Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, sold 100,000 tickets in less than eight hours, beating previous records set there by U2 and David Bowie.  The tour was briefly marred at a gig in Tacoma, Washington,where Townshend injured his arm on-stage.  Some critics disliked the tour's over-produced and expanded line-up, calling it \"The Who on Ice\";  Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic said the tour \"tarnished the reputation of the Who almost irreparably\". The tour included most of Tommy and included such guests as Phil Collins, Billy Idol and Elton John.  A 2-CD live album, Join Together, was released in 1990. \n\nPartial reunions\n\nIn 1990, the Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group have a featured collection in the hall's museum, including one of Moon's velvet suits, a Warwick bass of Entwistle's, and a drumhead from 1968. \n\nIn 1991, the Who recorded a cover of Elton John's \"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\" for the tribute album Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin. It was the last studio recording to feature Entwistle. In 1994, Daltrey turned 50 and celebrated with two concerts at New York's Carnegie Hall. The shows included guest spots by Entwistle and Townshend. Although all three surviving original members of the Who attended, they appeared on stage together only during the finale, \"Join Together\", with the other guests. Daltrey toured that year with Entwistle, Zak Starkey on drums and Simon Townshend filling in for his brother as guitarist.\n\nRe-formation\n\nRevival of Quadrophenia\n\nIn 1996, Townshend, Entwistle and Daltrey performed Quadrophenia with guests and Starkey on drums at Hyde Park. The performance was narrated by Daniels, who had played Jimmy in the 1979 film. Despite technical difficulties the show led to a six-night residency at Madison Square Garden and a US and European tour through 1996 and 1997. Townshend played mostly acoustic guitar, but eventually was persuaded to play some electric.  In 1998, VH1 ranked the Who ninth in their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Rock 'n' Roll\". \n\nCharity shows and Entwistle's death\n\nIn late 1999, the Who performed as a five-piece for the first time since 1985, with Bundrick on keyboards and Starkey on drums. The first show in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena  was partially broadcast on TV and the Internet and released as the DVD The Vegas Job. They then performed acoustic shows at Neil Young's Bridge School Benefit at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California,  followed by gigs at the House of Blues in Chicago  and two Christmas charity shows at the Shepherds Bush Empire in London.  Critics were delighted to see a rejuvenated band with a basic line-up comparable to the tours of the 1960s and 1970s. Andy Greene in Rolling Stone called the 1999 tour better than the final one with Moon in 1976.\n\nThe band toured the US and UK from June to October 2000, to generally favourable reviews,  culminating in a charity show at the Royal Albert Hall for the Teenage Cancer trust with guest performances from Paul Weller, Eddie Vedder, Noel Gallagher, Bryan Adams and Nigel Kennedy.  Stephen Tomas Erlewine described the gig as \"an exceptional reunion concert\".  In 2001 the band performed the Concert for New York City at Madison Square Garden for families of firefighters and police who had lost their lives following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center,  and were honoured with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. \n\nThe Who played concerts in the UK in early 2002 in preparation for a full US tour. On 27 June, the day before the first date,  Entwistle was found dead of a heart attack at 57 at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. Cocaine was a contributing factor. \n\nAfter Entwistle: Tours and Endless Wire\n\nEntwistle's son, Christopher, gave a statement supporting the Who's decision to carry on. The US tour began at the Hollywood Bowl with touring bassist Pino Palladino. Townshend dedicated the show to Entwistle, and ended with a montage of pictures of him. The tour lasted until September.  The loss of a founding member of the Who caused Townshend to re-evaluate his relationship with Daltrey, which had been strained over the band's career. He decided their friendship was important, and this ultimately led to writing and recording new material.\n\nTo combat bootlegging, the band began to release the Encore Series of official soundboard recordings via themusic.com. An official statement read: \"to satisfy this demand they have agreed to release their own official recordings to benefit worthy causes\". \n\nIn 2004, the Who released \"Old Red Wine\" and \"Real Good Looking Boy\" (with Palladino and Greg Lake, respectively, on bass) on a singles anthology, The Who: Then and Now, and went on an 18-date tour of Japan, Australia, the UK and the US, including a return appearance at the Isle of Wight.  Later that year, Rolling Stone ranked the Who No. 29 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. \n\nThe Who announced in 2005 that they were working on a new album. Townshend posted a novella called The Boy Who Heard Music on his blog, which developed into a mini-opera called Wire & Glass, forming the basis for the album.  Endless Wire, released in 2006, was the first full studio album of new material since 1982's It's Hard and contained the band's first mini-opera since \"Rael\" in 1967. The album reached No. 7 in the US and No. 9 in the UK.  Starkey was invited to join Oasis in April 2006 and the Who in November 2006, but he declined and split his time between the two. \n\nIn November 2007, the documentary Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who was released, featuring unreleased footage of the 1970 Leeds appearance and a 1964 performance at the Railway Hotel when the group were The High Numbers. Amazing Journey was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award. \n\nThe Who toured in support of Endless Wire, including the BBC Electric Proms at the Roundhouse in London in 2006,  headlining the 2007 Glastonbury Festival,  a half-time appearance at the Super Bowl XLIV in 2010  and being the final act at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.   In November 2012, the Who released Live at Hull, an album of the band's performance night after the Live at Leeds gig. \n\nQuadrophenia and More\n\nIn 2010 the Who performed Quadrophenia with parts played by Vedder and Tom Meighan at the Royal Albert Hall as part of the Teenage Cancer Trust series of 10 gigs.  A planned tour for early 2010 was jeopardised by the return of Townshend's tinnitus. He experimented with an in-ear monitoring system that was recommended by Neil Young and his audiologist. \n\nThe Quadrophenia and More tour started in November 2012 in Ottawa  with keyboardists John Corey, Loren Gold and Frank Simes, the latter of whom was also musical director.  In February 2013, Starkey pulled a tendon and was replaced for a gig by Scott Devours who performed with less than four hours' notice.  The tour moved to Europe and the UK, and ended at the Wembley Arena in July 2013. \n\nThe Who Hits 50!\n\nIn October 2013, Townshend announced the Who would stage their final tour in 2015, performing in locations they have never played before.   Daltrey clarified that the tour is unrelated to the band's 50th anniversary—which occurred in 2013—and indicated that he and Townshend were considering recording new material but would be emphasising their hits in their final stadium tour.  Daltrey stated, \"We can't go on touring forever ... it could be open-ended, but it will have a finality to it.\" \n\nIn June 2014, Jones reunited with the Who at a charity gig for Prostate Cancer UK his Hurtwood Polo Club, alongside Jeff Beck, Procol Harum, and Mike Rutherford.  Later that month, the Who announced plans for a world tour with a possible accompanying album.   In September, the Who released the song \"Be Lucky\", which was included on the compilation The Who Hits 50! in October. That November, the group released a virtual reality app co-designed by Daltrey's son, Jamie, featuring events and images from the band's history. \n\nIn June 2015, the Who headlined that year's Hyde Park Festival, and two days later, the Glastonbury Festival. Townshend suggested to Mojo that it could be the group's last UK gig.  To coincide with The Who's 50th anniversary, all studio albums, including the new compilation, The Who Hits 50!, were reissued on vinyl.  In September 2015, all remaining US tour dates were cancelled after Daltrey contracted viral meningitis. Then Townshend promised the band would come back \"stronger than ever\".  \n\nBack to the Who Tour 51!\n\nOn 11 June 2016 in Newport, England, The Who embarked on the Back to the Who Tour 51!, a new tour seen as a continuation of the previous year's tour.   Currently scheduled to end on 12 April 2017 in Birmingham, UK, the new tour included a return visit to the Isle of Wight Festival on the opening date.   \n\nMusical style and equipment\n\nThe Who have been regarded primarily as a rock band, yet have taken influence from several other styles of music during their career. The original group played a mixture of trad jazz and contemporary pop hits as the Detours, and R&B in 1963. The group move to a mod sound the following year, particularly after hearing the Small Faces fuse Motown with a harsher R&B sound.  The group's early work was geared towards singles, though it was not straightforward pop. In 1967, Townshend coined the term \"power pop\" to describe the Who's style. Like their contemporaries, the group were influenced by the arrival of Hendrix, particularly after the Who and the Experience met at Monterey. This and lengthy touring strengthened the band's sound. In the studio, they began to develop softer pieces, particularly from Tommy onwards, and turned their attention towards albums more than singles.\n\nFrom the early 1970s, the band's sound included synthesizers, particularly on Who's Next and Quadrophenia. Although groups had used synthesizers before, the Who were one of the first to integrate the sound into a basic rock structure. In By Numbers the group's style had scaled back to more standard rock, but synthesisers regained prominence on Face Dances. \n\nTownshend and Entwistle were instrumental in making extreme volumes and distortion standard rock practices.  The Who were early adopters of Marshall Amplification. Entwistle was the first member to get two 4×12 speaker cabinets, quickly followed by Townshend. The group used feedback as part of their guitar sound, both live and in the studio. In 1967, Townshend changed to using Sound City amplifiers, customised by Dave Reeves, then in 1970 to Hiwatt. The group were the first to use a 1000 watt PA systems for live gigs, which led to competition from bands such as the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd. \n\nThroughout their careers, the members of the Who have said their live sound has never been captured as they wished on record. Live gigs and the audience have always been important to the group. \"Irish\" Jack Lyons said, \"The Who weren't a joke, they were fucking real, and so were we.\"\n\nVocals\n\nDaltrey initially based his style on Motown and rock and roll, but from Tommy onwards he tackled a wider range of styles. His trademark sound with the band, as noted in 1983, has been a characteristic scream, as heard at the end of \"Won't Get Fooled Again\".\n\nGroup backing vocals are prominent in the Who. After \"I Can't Explain\" used session men for backing vocals, Townshend and Entwistle resolved to do better themselves on subsequent releases, producing strong backing harmonies.  Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle sang lead on various songs, and occasionally Moon joined in. Who's Next featured Daltrey and Townshend sharing the lead vocals on several songs, and biographer Dave Marsh considers the contrast between Daltrey's strong, guttural baritone and Townshend's higher and gentler tenor to be one of the album's highlights.\n\nDaltrey's voice is negatively affected by marijuana smoke, to which he says he is allergic. On 20 May 2015, during a Who concert at Nassau Coliseum, he smelled a joint burning and told the smoker to put it out or \"the show will be over”. The fan obliged, without taking Pete Townshend's advice that \"the quickest way\" to extinguish a joint is \"up your fucking arse\".  \n\nGuitars\n\nTownshend considered himself less technical than guitarists such as Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck and wanted to stand out visually instead. His playing style evolved from the banjo, favouring down strokes and using a combination of the plectrum and fingerpicking. His rhythm playing frequently used seventh chords and suspended fourths,  and he is associated with the power chord, an easy-to-finger chord built from the root and fifth interval that has since become a fundamental part of the rock guitar vocabulary.  Townshend also produced noises by manipulating controls on his guitar and by allowing the instrument to feedback.\n\nIn the group's early career, Townshend favoured Rickenbacker guitars as they allowed him to fret rhythm guitar chords easily and move the neck back and forwards to create vibrato.  From 1968 to 1973, he favoured a Gibson SG Special live,  and later used customised Les Pauls in different tunings. \n\nIn the studio for Who's Next and thereafter, Townshend used a 1959 Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins hollow-body guitar, a Fender Bandmaster amp and an Edwards volume pedal, all gifts from Joe Walsh.   Townshend started his career with an acoustic guitar and has regularly recorded and written with a Gibson J-200. \n\nBass\n\nA distinctive part of the original band's sound was Entwistle's lead bass playing, while Townshend concentrated on rhythm and chords. Entwistle's was the first popular use of Rotosound strings in 1966, trying to find a piano-like sound.  His bassline on \"Pinball Wizard\" was described by Who biographer John Atkins as \"a contribution of its own without diminishing the guitar lines\"; he described his part on \"The Real Me\" from Quadrophenia, recorded in one take, as \"a bass solo with vocals\". Entwistle's basses include a \"Frankenstein\" assembled from five Fender Precision and Jazz basses, and Warwick, Alembic, Gretsch and Guild basses. \n\nDrums\n\nMoon further strengthened the reversal of traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums. His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.\n\nJones' drumming style was in sharp contrast to Moon's.  The Who were initially enthusiastic about working with a completely different drummer, though Townshend later stated, \"we've never really been able to replace Keith.\"  Starkey knew Moon from childhood and Moon gave him his first drum kit. Starkey has been praised for his playing style which echoes Moon's without being a copy. \n\nSongwriting\n\nTownshend focused on writing meaningful lyrics inspired by Bob Dylan, whose words dealt with subjects other than boy–girl relationships that were common in rock music; in contrast to Dylan's intellectualism, Townshend believed his lyrics should be about things kids could relate to. Early material focused on the frustration and anxiety shared by mod audiences, which Townshend said was a result of \"searching for  niche\". By The Who Sell Out, he began to work narrative and characters into songs, which he fully developed by Tommy, including spiritual themes influenced by Baba. From the mid-1970s onwards, his songs tended to be more personal, which influenced his decision to go solo.\n\nEntwistle's songs, by contrast, typically feature black humour and darker themes. His two contributions to Tommy (\"Cousin Kevin\" and \"Fiddle About\") appeared because Townshend did not believe he could write songs as \"nasty\" as Entwistle's.\n\nPersonal relationships\n\nThe Who are perceived as having had a poor working relationship. In the original band, Sandom had been the peacemaker and settled disputes. Moon, by contrast, was as volatile as Daltrey and Townshend. Entwistle was too passive to become involved in arguments. The group established their live reputation and stage show in part out of insecurity and aggression amongst its members and Townshend recalled that all decisions had to be made democratically \"because we always disagreed\".\n\nThe only genuine friendship in the Who during the 1960s was between Entwistle and Moon. The pair enjoyed each other's sense of humour and shared a fondness for clubbing. Journalist Richard Green noted a \"chemistry of playfullness that would go beyond playfullness\". Their relationship diminished somewhat when Entwistle got married in 1967, though they still socialised on tour. When Moon was destroying toilets in hotels, Entwistle confessed he \"was standing behind him with the matches\". \n\nThe group regularly argued in the press, though Townshend said disputes were amplified in print and the group simply found it difficult to agree on things.  Tommy mutually benefitted Townshend and Daltrey's standing in the band because of the former's songwriting and the latter's stage presence, yet even this did not make them close friends. The pair quarrelled, particularly in the mid-1970s, over the group's direction. During his time with the band, Jones was subject to intermittent criticism from Daltrey.\n\nEntwistle's death came as a shock to both Townshend and Daltrey, and caused them to re-evaluate their relationship. Townshend has said that he and Daltrey have since become close friends. In 2015, Townshend confirmed their friendship was still strong, adding their acceptance of each other's differences \"brought us to a really genuine and compassionate relationship, which can only be described as love.\"\n\nLegacy and influence\n\nThe Who are one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century.   Their appearances at Monterey and Woodstock helped give them a reputation as one of the greatest live rock acts  and they have been credited with originating the \"rock opera\". As of October 2014, the group has sold over 100 million records worldwide. \n\nThe group's contributions to rock include the power chord,  windmill strum  and the use of non-musical instrument noise such as feedback. The band had an impact on fashion from their earliest days with their embrace of pop art  and the use of the Union Jack for clothing.   The guitar-smashing incident at the Railway Hotel in 1964 is one of Rolling Stone magazine's \"50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock 'n' Roll\". \n\nPink Floyd began to use feedback from their early shows in 1966, inspired by the Who, whom they considered a formative influence. Shortly after arriving in London in 1966, Hendrix visited Marshall's music shop demanding an amp setup like Townshend's and manipulated electronic noises in ways that Townshend had pioneered. The Beatles were fans and socialised with Moon in particular during the mid-1960s. In 1965, Paul McCartney said the Who \"are the most exciting thing around\" and was inspired to write \"Helter Skelter\" in the group's \"heavy\" style; John Lennon borrowed the acoustic guitar style in \"Pinball Wizard\" for \"Polythene Pam\".\n\nThe loud volume of the band's live show influenced the approach of hard rock and heavy metal. Proto punk and punk rock bands such as the MC5,  the Stooges,  the Ramones  the Sex Pistols, the Clash  and Green Day cite the Who as an influence.  The Who inspired mod revival bands, particularly the Jam,  which helped other groups influenced by the Who become popular. In the mid-1990s, Britpop bands such as Blur  and Oasis were influenced by the Who.  The Who have also influenced pop punk band Panic! at the Disco. \n\nThe Who have inspired many tribute bands; Daltrey has endorsed the Whodlums, who raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust.   Many bands have covered Who songs; Elton John's version of \"Pinball Wizard\" reached No. 7 in the UK. \n\nMedia\n\nDuring the Who's hiatuses in the 1980s and 90s, Townshend developed his skills as a music publisher to be financially successful from the Who without recording or touring. He countered criticism of \"selling out\" by saying that licensing the songs to other media allows a wider exposure and widens the group's appeal.\n\nThe American forensic drama CSI (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, and CSI: Cyber) feature Who songs as theme music, \"Who Are You\", \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"I Can See for Miles\" respectively.   The group's songs have featured in other popular TV series such as The Simpsons,  and Top Gear, which had an episode where the presenters were tasked with being roadies for the band. \n\nRock-orientated films such as Almost Famous,  School of Rock  and Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny refer to the band and feature their songs,  and other films have used the band's material in their soundtracks, including Apollo 13 (which used \"I Can See For Miles\")  and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (which used a take of \"My Generation\" recorded for the BBC).  Several of the band's tracks have appeared in the video game Rock Band and its sequels. \n\nAwards and nominations\n\nThe Who have received many awards and accolades from the music industry for their recordings and their influence. They received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988,  and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001. \n\nThe group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 where their display describes them as \"prime contenders, in the minds of many, for the title of World's Greatest Rock Band\",   and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005.  Seven of the group's albums appeared on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, more than any act except the Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen. \n\nBand members\n\nCurrent members\n* Roger Daltrey – vocals, guitar, harmonica, percussion (1964–present)\n* Pete Townshend – guitar, keyboards, vocals (1964–present)\n\nPast members\n* John Entwistle – bass guitar, horns, keyboards, vocals (1964–2002; his death)\n* Doug Sandom – drums (1964)\n* Keith Moon – drums, vocals (1964–78; his death)\n* Kenney Jones – drums (1978–88)\n\nTouring musicians\n* Zak Starkey – drums, percussion (1996–present)\n* Simon Townshend – guitar, backing vocals (1996–97, 2002–present)\n* Pino Palladino – bass guitar (2002–present)\n* John Corey – keyboards, backing vocals (2012–present)\n* Loren Gold – keyboards, backing vocals (2012–present)\n* Frank Simes – keyboards, backing vocals, musical director (2012–present) \n\nFormer touring musicians\n* John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick – keyboards, backing vocals (1979–81, 1985–11)\n* Tim Gorman – keyboards, backing vocals (1982)\n* Simon Philips – drums (1989)\n* Steve \"Boltz\" Bolton – guitar (1989)\n* Jody Linscott – percussion (1989–97)\n* Jon Carin – keyboards, percussion (1996–97)\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n* My Generation (1965)\n* A Quick One (1966)\n* The Who Sell Out (1967)\n* Tommy (1969)\n* Who's Next (1971)\n* Quadrophenia (1973)\n* The Who by Numbers (1975)\n* Who Are You (1978)\n* Face Dances (1981)\n* It's Hard (1982)\n* Endless Wire (2006)\n\nTours and performances\n\nHeadlining 1960s–1990s\n\n* 1962–63 performances\n* 1964 performances\n* 1965 Tour\n* 1966 Tour\n* 1967 Tour\n* 1968 Tour\n* 1969 Tour\n* 1970 Tour\n* 1971 Tour\n* 1972 Tour\n* 1973 Tour\n* 1974 Tour\n* 1975 Tour\n* 1977–78 performances\n* 1979 Tour\n* 1980 Tour\n* Face Dances Tour\n* It's Hard Tour\n* 1985 and 1988 reunions\n* 1989 Tour\n* 1996–1997 Tour\n* 1999 performances\n\nHeadlining 2000s–2010s\n\n* 2000 Tour\n* 2001 The Concert for New York City appearance\n* 2002 Tour\n* 2004 Tour\n* 2005 Live 8 appearance\n* Endless Wire Tour\n* 2008–2009 Tour\n* 2010 performances\n* 2011 performances\n* 2012–13 Tour\n* 2012 12–12–12: The Concert for Sandy Relief appearance\n* 2014–16 Tour (The Who Hits 50!

His elder brother is the writer and television presenter Marcel Theroux . He is the cousin of American actor Justin Theroux . Brought up in the UK, he holds dual UK-USA citizenship. His surname is of French Canadian provenance and originates from the region around Sarthe and Yonne in France.\nEarly life\nTheroux was educated at Westminster School (where he was a friend and contemporary of the comedians Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish ). He then went to Magdalen College, Oxford where he gained a degree in modern history.\nEarly career\nHis first journalism job was at Metro Silicon Valley , an alternative free weekly newspaper in San Jose, California . In 1992 he was hired as a writer for Spy magazine. He was also working as a correspondent on Michael Moore 's TV Nation series, for which he provided segments on off-beat cultural subjects, including Avon ladies in the Amazon , the Jerusalem syndrome , and the attempts by the Ku Klux Klan to rebrand itself as a civil rights group for white people. When TV Nation ended he was signed to a development deal by the BBC , out of which came Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends . He has guest-written for a number of publications including Hip-Hop Connection and he continues to write for The Idler .\nPersonal life\nHe lives in the London district of Harlesden with his girlfriend, Nancy, with whom he has two children, Albert and Frederick. [3]\nDocumentaries\nMain article: Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends\nIn Weird Weekends (1998–2000), Theroux followed marginal, mostly American subcultures like survivalists , Black nationalists , White supremacists and porn stars , often by living among or close to the people involved. Often, his documentary method subtly exposed the contradictions or farcical elements of some seriously-held beliefs. Theroux himself describes the aim of the series as\n“\nSetting out to discover the genuinely odd in the most ordinary setting. To me, it's almost a privilege to be welcomed into these communities and to shine a light on them and, maybe, through my enthusiasm, to get people to reveal more of themselves than they may have intended. The show is laughing at me, adrift in their world, as much as at them. I don't have to play up that stuff. I'm not a matinee idol disguised as a nerd.\n”\nMain article: When Louis Met…\nIn When Louis Met… (2000–2002), Theroux accompanied a different British celebrity in each programme as they went about their day-to-day business, interviewing them about their lives and experiences as he did so. His episode about the DJ and charity fundraiser Sir Jimmy Savile When Louis Met Jimmy was voted one of the top fifty documentaries of all time in a survey by Britain's Channel 4 . In When Louis Met the Hamiltons, the disgraced Tory MP Neil Hamilton and his wife Christine were arrested following false allegations of indecent assault during the course of filming. In When Louis Met Max Clifford, Max Clifford tried to set Louis up. However, it backfired when Max Clifford was caught lying, as the crew was still recording his live microphone during a conversation. After this celebrity series concluded, a retrospective was aired, called Life with Louis. He was meant to do a similar program with Michael Jackson before Martin Bashir completed his documentary for channel 4, but it was cancelled.[citation needed]\nSpecial Episodes\nIn these special programmes (2003–2006), Theroux returned to American themes, working at feature-length, this time with a more natural tone. One, Louis and the Brothel, takes a sympathetic look at the prostitutes working at a legal brothel in Nevada . Other programmes include Louis and the Nazis , and Louis, Martin & Michael . In March 2006, he signed a new deal with the BBC to make ten films over the course of three years. [4]\nBBC 2 Specials\nMain article: Louis Theroux's BBC 2 Specials\nThe first programme in his new series was titled Louis Theroux: Gambling in Las Vegas and followed Louis investigating the high rollers and those who manage casinos in Vegas . Dr Martha Ogman was one of the main characters of the show and as the interviews with her took place it became evident that she was clearly addicted to gambling. Near the end of the programme it was revealed that in just seven years, she had lost in excess of $4 million. All in all Louis was $4,590 up from $3,000 at the end of what he called his \"blowout night\" playing Baccarat in addition to turning $500 into $700 on his first foray into gambling at the Blackjack tables. As an interesting aside, the money gambled was his own, not part of the production budget.\nIn the second show, The Most Hated Family in America , which aired on 1 April 2007, he followed members of the highly controversial Westboro Baptist Church , a small family community infamous for strong anti-homosexual beliefs and the picketing of funerals of US soldiers.\nThe third programme (aired on 7 October 2007), Louis Theroux: Under The Knife, saw Theroux follow patients having cosmetic surgery in California before receiving liposuction himself.\nThe fourth programme, Louis Theroux: Behind Bars (aired on 13 January 2008), saw Louis immerse himself in San Quentin Prison by exploring the relationships between prisoners and their guards. [5]\nThe fifth in the series called Louis Theroux's African Hunting Holiday, aired on 6 April 2008. In this episode, Louis visits South African game, where near-extinct and other African species are bred to be hunted by predominantly American tourists.\nThe sixth in the series aired on 30 November 2008, entitled Law and Disorder in Philadelphia. In this episode Louis spent some time with the Philadelphia Police Department as they patrolled one of the most dangerous areas of the city. The second part is called Law and Disorder in Johannesburg and aired on 7 December 2008, on BBC Two .\nThe eighth episode in the series is entitled A Place for Paedophiles and was aired on 19 April 2009 on BBC2. In this episode, Louis visited the Coalinga State Hospital in California where they try to rehabilitate sex offenders.\nThe ninth episode in the series, entitled The City Addicted to Crystal Meth was aired on 9 August 2009 on BBC2. In this episode, Louis spends time with the Fresno Police Department in Fresno , California documenting the numerous drug addicts using Methamphetamine , (US street slang \"Crystal Meth\" or 'Ice'), and their attempts at rehabilitation. [6] .\nBooks\nHis first book, The Call of the Weird: Travels in American Subcultures , was published in Britain in 2005. In this book, Theroux returns to America to find out what has happened in the lives of some of the people he featured in his television programmes since he last saw them.\nHis second book, entitled 'May Contain Traces of Nuts: A Year in the Life of a Minor TV Celebrity', was published in January 2010.\nAwards and nominations",

He moved to the UK when he was four, and was brought up in London.\nTheroux was educated for a couple of years at Allfarthing Primary School then moved to Westminster School (where he was a friend and contemporary of the comedians Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish ). Another of his contemporaries was Liberal Democrat politician, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg with whom he travelled to America. [5] He then went to Magdalen College, Oxford where he gained a first class degree in modern history and was noted for his film reviews for the Grapevine magazine.\nHis first journalism job was at Metro Silicon Valley , an alternative free weekly newspaper in San Jose, California . In 1992 he was hired as a writer for Spy magazine. He was also working as a correspondent on Michael Moore 's TV Nation series, for which he provided segments on off-beat cultural subjects, including Avon ladies in the Amazon , the Jerusalem syndrome , and the attempts by the Ku Klux Klan to rebrand itself as a civil rights group for white people. When TV Nation ended he was signed to a development deal by the BBC , out of which came Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends . He has guest-written for a number of publications including Hip-Hop Connection and he continues to write for The Idler .\n  Documentaries\nMain article: Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends\nIn Weird Weekends (1998–2000), Theroux followed marginal, mostly American subcultures like survivalists , black nationalists , white supremacists and porn stars , often by living among or close to the people involved. Often, his documentary method subtly exposed the contradictions or farcical elements of some seriously held beliefs. Theroux himself describes the aim of the series as\n“\nSetting out to discover the genuinely odd in the most ordinary setting. To me, it's almost a privilege to be welcomed into these communities and to shine a light on them and, maybe, through my enthusiasm, to get people to reveal more of themselves than they may have intended. The show is laughing at me, adrift in their world, as much as at them. I don't have to play up that stuff. I'm not a matinee idol disguised as a nerd.\n”\nDespite much call for a complete DVD set of Weird Weekends only selected episodes have ever been available for purchase.\n  When Louis Met...\nMain article: When Louis Met...\nIn When Louis Met... (2000–02), Theroux accompanied a different British celebrity in each programme as they went about their day-to-day business, interviewing them about their lives and experiences as he did so. His episode about the DJ and charity fundraiser Sir Jimmy Savile When Louis Met Jimmy was voted one of the top fifty documentaries of all time in a survey by Britain's Channel 4 . In When Louis Met the Hamiltons, the disgraced Tory MP Neil Hamilton and his wife Christine were arrested following false allegations of indecent assault during the course of filming. In When Louis Met Max Clifford, Max Clifford tried to set Louis up. However, it backfired when Max Clifford was caught lying, as the crew was still recording his live microphone during a conversation. After this celebrity series concluded, a retrospective was aired, called Life with Louis. He was meant to do a similar programme with Michael Jackson before Martin Bashir completed his documentary for ITV, but it was cancelled.[ citation needed ]\nSelected episodes of When Louis Met... were included as bonus content on a Best-Of collection of Weird Weekends. The entire series has never been released on DVD.\n  BBC Two specials\nMain article: Louis Theroux's BBC 2 Specials\nIn these special programmes, beginning in 2003, Theroux returned to American themes, working at feature-length, this time with a more natural tone. In March 2006, he signed a new deal with the BBC to make 10 films over the course of three years. [6] Subjects for the specials include criminal gangs in Lagos, Neo-Nazis in America, ultra-Zionists in Israel and child psychiatry. A 2007 special, The Most Hated Family in America , received strong critical praise from the international media.\n  Books\nHis first book, The Call of the Weird: Travels in American Subcultures , was published in Britain in 2005. In this book, Theroux returns to America to find out what has happened in the lives of some of the people he featured in his television programmes since he last saw them. [2]\n  Personal life\nHe lives in the London district of Harlesden with his partner, Nancy Strang, a TV director, and his two sons. [2] [7]\n  Awards and nominations",

                "Alan Bennett (born 9 May 1934) is an English playwright, screenwriter, actor and author. He was born in Leeds and attended Oxford University where he studied history and performed with the Oxford Revue. He stayed to teach and research medieval history at the university for several years. His collaboration as writer and performer with Dudley Moore, Jonathan Miller and Peter Cook in the satirical revue Beyond the Fringe at the 1960 Edinburgh Festival brought him instant fame. He gave up academia, and turned to writing full-time, his first stage play Forty Years On being produced in 1968.\n\nHis work includes The Madness of George III and its film adaptation, the series of monologues Talking Heads, the play and subsequent film The History Boys, and popular audio books, including his readings of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\nEarly life\n\nBennett was born in Armley in Leeds. The son of a co-op butcher, Walter, and his wife Lilian Mary (née Peel), Bennett attended Christ Church, Upper Armley, Church of England School (in the same class as Barbara Taylor Bradford), and then Leeds Modern School (now Lawnswood School). \n\nHe learned Russian at the Joint Services School for Linguists during his national service before applying for a scholarship at Oxford University. He was accepted by Exeter College, Oxford, from which he graduated with a first-class degree in history. While at Oxford he performed comedy with a number of eventually successful actors in the Oxford Revue. He was to remain at the university for several years, where he researched and taught Medieval History, before deciding he was not cut out to be an academic.\n\nCareer\n\nIn August 1960 Bennett, along with Dudley Moore, Jonathan Miller and Peter Cook, achieved instant fame by appearing at the Edinburgh Festival in the satirical revue Beyond the Fringe. After the festival, the show continued in London and New York. He also appeared in My Father Knew Lloyd George. His highly regarded television comedy sketch series On the Margin (1966) was unfortunately erased; the BBC re-used expensive videotape rather than keep it in the archives.   However, in 2014 it was announced that copies of the entire series had been found.\n\nAround this time Bennett often found himself playing vicars and claims that as an adolescent he assumed he would grow up to be a Church of England clergyman, for no better reason than that he looked like one.\n\nBennett's first stage play Forty Years On, directed by Patrick Garland, was produced in 1968. Many television, stage and radio plays followed, with screenplays, short stories, novellas, a large body of non-fictional prose, and broadcasting and many appearances as an actor.\n\nBennett's distinctive, expressive voice (which bears a strong Leeds accent) and the sharp humour and evident humanity of his writing have made his readings of his work very popular, especially the autobiographical writings. Bennett's readings of the Winnie the Pooh stories are also widely enjoyed.\n\nMany of Bennett's characters are unfortunate and downtrodden. Life has brought them to an impasse or else passed them by. In many cases they have met with disappointment in the realm of sex and intimate relationships, largely through tentativeness and a failure to connect with others.\n\nDespite a long history with both the National Theatre and the BBC - Bennett never writes on commission, declaring \"I don't work on commission, I just do it on spec. If people don't want it then it's too bad.\" \n\nBennett is both unsparing and compassionate in laying bare his characters' frailties. This can be seen in his television plays for LWT from the early 1970s through to his work for the BBC in the early 1980s. His many works for television include his first play for the medium, A Day Out in 1972,  A Little Outing in 1977, Intensive Care in 1982, An Englishman Abroad in 1983, and A Question of Attribution in 1991.  But his perhaps most famous screen work is the 1987 Talking Heads series of monologues for television which were later performed at the Comedy Theatre in London in 1992. This was a sextet of poignantly comic pieces, each depicting several stages in the character's decline from an initial state of denial or ignorance of their predicament, through a slow realisation of the hopelessness of their situation, progressing to a bleak or ambiguous conclusion. A second set of six Talking Heads followed a decade later, which was darker and more disturbing.\n\nIn his 2005 prose collection Untold Stories Bennett has written candidly and movingly of the mental illness that his mother and other family members suffered. Much of his work draws on his Leeds background and while he is celebrated for his acute observations of a particular type of northern speech (\"It'll take more than Dairy Box to banish memories of Pearl Harbour\"), the range and daring of his work is often undervalued. His television play The Old Crowd includes shots of the director and technical crew, while his stage play The Lady in the Van includes two characters named Alan Bennett.\n\nThe Lady in the Van was based on his experiences with an eccentric called Miss Shepherd, who lived on Bennett's driveway in a series of dilapidated vans for more than fifteen years. A radio play of the same title was broadcast on 21 February 2009 on BBC Radio 4, with actress Maggie Smith reprising her role of Miss Shepherd and Alan Bennett playing himself. The work has also been published in book form. Alan Bennett adapted The Lady in the Van for the stage. In 2015 a film version was released to critical acclaim. Once again Dame Maggie Smith played Miss Shepherd, with Alex Jennings appearing as two versions of Bennett. Alan Bennett himself appears in a cameo at the very end of the film.  \n\nBennett adapted his 1991 play The Madness of George III for the cinema. Entitled The Madness of King George (1994), the film received four Academy Award nominations: for Bennett's writing and the performances of Nigel Hawthorne and Helen Mirren. It won the award for best art direction.\n\nBennett's critically acclaimed The History Boys won three Laurence Olivier Awards in 2005, for Best New Play, Best Actor (Richard Griffiths), and Best Direction (Nicholas Hytner), having previously won Critics' Circle Theatre Awards and Evening Standard Awards for Best Actor and Best Play. Bennett also received the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Theatre.  The History Boys won six Tony Awards on Broadway, including best play, best performance by a leading actor in a play (Richard Griffiths), best performance by a featured actress in a play (Frances de la Tour), and best direction of a play (Nicholas Hytner). A film version of The History Boys was released in the UK in October 2006.\n\nBennett wrote the play Enjoy in 1980. It was one of the rare flops in his career and barely scraped a run of seven weeks at the Vaudeville Theatre, in spite of the stellar cast of Joan Plowright, Colin Blakely, Susan Littler, Philip Sayer, Liz Smith (who replaced Joan Hickson during rehearsals) and, in his first West End role, Marc Sinden. It was directed by Ronald Eyre.  A new production of Enjoy attracted very favourable notices during its 2008 UK tour  and moved to the West End of London in January 2009.  The West End show took over £1m in advance ticket sales  and even extended the run to cope with demand.  The production starred Alison Steadman, David Troughton, Richard Glaves, Carol Macready and Josie Walker.\n\nAt the National Theatre in late 2009 Nicholas Hytner directed Bennett's play The Habit of Art, about the relationship between the poet W.H. Auden and the composer Benjamin Britten. \n\nBennett's play People opened at the National Theatre in October 2012. \n\nPersonal life\n\nIn September 2005, Bennett revealed that, in 1997, he had undergone treatment for cancer, and described the illness as a \"bore\". His chances of survival were given as being \"much less\" than 50%.  He began Untold Stories (published 2005) thinking it would be published posthumously, but his cancer went into remission. In the autobiographical sketches which form a large part of the book Bennett writes openly for the first time about his homosexuality. Previously Bennett had referred to questions about his sexuality as like asking a man who has just crawled across the Sahara desert to choose between Perrier or Malvern mineral water. \n\nBennett lives in Camden Town in London, and shares his home with Rupert Thomas, the editor of World of Interiors magazine.  Bennett also had a long-term relationship with his former housekeeper, Anne Davies, until her death in 2009. \n\nBennett is a lapsed Anglican; brought up in the church, he became very religious as a teenager, but has \"slowly left it [The Church] over the years,\" though he still holds a faith, and is often supportive of the restoration of churches throughout Britain. \n\nArchive\n\nIn October 2008 Bennett announced that he was donating his entire archive of working papers, unpublished manuscripts, diaries and books to the Bodleian Library, stating that it was a gesture of thanks repaying a debt he felt he owed to the British welfare state that had given him educational opportunities which his humble family background would otherwise never have afforded. \n\nDepictions\n\n* In the film for television Not Only But Always, about the careers of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, Bennett is portayed by  Alan Cox.\n* Along with the other members of Beyond the Fringe, Bennett is portrayed in the play Pete and Dud: Come Again, by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde.\n* Bennett voices himself in the episode \"Brian's Play\" of the animated series Family Guy.\n* Bennett was portrayed  by Harry Enfield as Stalin, in an episode of \"Talking Heads of State\", in BBC Two's 2014 satirical Harry and Paul's Story of the Twos. \n* Bennett is portrayed by Reece Dinsdale in a 2014 production of Untold Stories at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. \n* Bennett is portrayed by British actor Alex Jennings in the 2015 comedy-drama film The Lady in the Van.

He was also awarded a D.Litt by the University of Leeds in 1990  and an honorary doctorate from Kingston University in 1996. In 1998 he refused an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, in protest at its acceptance of funding for a chair from press baron Rupert Murdoch.  He also declined a CBE in 1988 and a knighthood in 1996.  He has stated that, although he is not a republican, he would never wish to be knighted, saying it would be a bit like having to wear a suit for the rest of his life.  Bennett earned Honorary Membership of The Coterie in the 2007 membership list.\n\nIn December 2011 Bennett returned to Lawnswood School, nearly 60 years after he left, to unveil the renamed Alan Bennett Library.  He said he \"loosely\" based The History Boys on his experiences at the school and his admission to Oxford. Lawnswood School dedicated its library to the writer after he emerged as a vocal campaigner against public library cuts.  Plans to shut local libraries were \"wrong and very short-sighted\", Bennett said, adding: \"We're impoverishing young people.\"",
                "Sheffield is a city and metropolitan borough in South Yorkshire, England.  Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, its name derives from the River Sheaf, which runs through the city.  With some of its southern suburbs annexed from Derbyshire, the city has grown from its largely industrial roots to encompass a wider economic base. The population of the City of Sheffield is  ()  and it is one of the eight largest regional English cities that make up the Core Cities Group.  Sheffield is the third largest English district by population. The metropolitan population of Sheffield is 1,569,000.\n\nIn the 19th century, Sheffield gained an international reputation for steel production.  Many innovations were developed locally, including crucible and stainless steel, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population in the Industrial Revolution.  Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893.  International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.\n\nThe 21st century has seen extensive redevelopment in Sheffield along with other British cities.  Sheffield's gross value added (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at £9.2 billion in 2007. The economy has experienced steady growth averaging around 5% annually, greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber.\n\nThe city is in the valleys of the River Don and its four tributaries, the Loxley, the Porter Brook, the Rivelin and the Sheaf.  61% of Sheffield's entire area is green space, and a third of the city lies within the Peak District national park.  There are more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens in the city, and an estimated 2 million trees, giving Sheffield the highest ratio of trees to people of any city in Europe. The city has a long sporting heritage, and is home to the world's oldest football club.\n\nHistory\n\nThe area now occupied by the City of Sheffield is believed to have been inhabited since at least the late Upper Palaeolithic period, about 12,800 years ago.  The earliest evidence of human occupation in the Sheffield area was found at Creswell Crags to the east of the city. In the Iron Age the area became the southernmost territory of the Pennine tribe called the Brigantes. It is this tribe who are thought to have constructed several hill forts in and around Sheffield. Following the departure of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been the southern part of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia.  Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. A Celtic presence within the Sheffield area is evidenced by two settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield.  The settlements that grew and merged to form Sheffield, however, date from the second half of the first millennium, and are of Anglo-Saxon and Danish origin.  In Anglo-Saxon times, the Sheffield area straddled the border between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that King Eanred of Northumbria submitted to King Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829,  a key event in the unification of the kingdom of England under the House of Wessex.  After the Norman conquest, Sheffield Castle was built to protect the local settlements, and a small town developed that is the nucleus of the modern city. \n\nBy 1296, a market had been established at what is now known as Castle Square,  and Sheffield subsequently grew into a small market town.  In the 14th century, Sheffield was already noted for the production of knives, as mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales,  and by the early 1600s it had become the main centre of cutlery manufacture in England outside London, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire.  From 1570 to 1584, Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned in Sheffield Castle and Sheffield Manor. \n\nDuring the 1740s, a form of the crucible steel process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of a better quality of steel than had previously been possible.  In about the same period, a technique was developed for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot to produce silver plating, which became widely known as Sheffield plate.  These innovations spurred Sheffield's growth as an industrial town,  but the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19th century. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402 people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19th century; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and was granted a city charter in 1893.  The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed on the outskirts of the town. The collapse of the dam wall of one of these reservoirs in 1864 resulted in the Great Sheffield Flood, which killed 270 people and devastated large parts of the town.  The growing population led to the construction of many back-to-back dwellings that, along with severe pollution from the factories, inspired George Orwell in 1937 to write: \"Sheffield, I suppose, could justly claim to be called the ugliest town in the Old World\". \n\nA recession in the 1930s was halted by increasing international tensions as the Second World War loomed; Sheffield's steel factories were set to work manufacturing weapons and ammunition for the war effort. As a result, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred on the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, now known as the Sheffield Blitz. More than 660 lives were lost and many buildings destroyed. \n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, many of the city's slums were demolished, and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats. Large parts of the city centre were also cleared to make way for a new system of roads. Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the closure of many steel mills. The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield's industries, along with those of many other areas of the UK.  The building of the Meadowhall Centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but hastening the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 World Student Games, which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium and the Ponds Forge complex.\n\nSheffield is changing rapidly as new projects regenerate some of the more run-down parts of the city. One such, the Heart of the City Project, has initiated a number of public works in the city centre: the Peace Gardens were renovated in 1998, the Millennium Galleries opened in April 2001, the Winter Gardens were opened in May 2003, and a public space to link these two areas, the Millennium Square, was opened in May 2006. Additional developments included the remodelling of Sheaf Square, in front of the recently refurbished railway station. The new square contains \"The Cutting Edge\", a sculpture designed by Si Applied Ltd  and made from Sheffield steel.\n\nSheffield was particularly hard-hit during the 2007 United Kingdom floods and the 2010 Big Freeze. Many landmark buildings such as Meadowhall and the Sheffield Wednesday grounds flooded due to being close to nearby rivers that flow through the city.\n\nGovernment\n\n \n\nSheffield is governed at the local level by Sheffield City Council. It consists of 84 councillors elected to represent 28 wards: three councillors per ward. Following the 2016 local elections, the distribution of council seats is Labour 57, Liberal Democrats 19, the Green Party 4 and UKIP 4. The city also has a Lord Mayor; though now simply a ceremonial position, in the past the office carried considerable authority, with executive powers over the finances and affairs of the city council.\n\nFor much of its history the council was controlled by the Labour Party, and was noted for its leftist sympathies; during the 1980s, when Sheffield City Council was led by David Blunkett, the area gained the epithet the \"Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire\".  However, the Liberal Democrats controlled the Council between 1999 and 2001 and took control again from 2008 to 2011.\n\nThe majority of council-owned facilities are operated by independent charitable trusts. Sheffield International Venues runs many of the city's sporting and leisure facilities, including Sheffield Arena and the English Institute of Sport. Museums Sheffield and the Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust take care of galleries and museums owned by the council. \n\nThe city returns five members of parliament to the House of Commons, with a sixth, the Member of Parliament for Penistone and Stocksbridge representing parts of Sheffield and Barnsley.  The former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is also an MP for Sheffield, representing Sheffield Hallam.\n\nGeography\n\nSheffield is located at . It lies directly beside Rotherham, from which it is separated largely by the M1 motorway. Although Barnsley Metropolitan Borough also borders Sheffield to the north, the town itself is a few miles further away. The southern and western borders of the city are shared with Derbyshire; in the first half of the 20th century Sheffield extended its borders south into Derbyshire, annexing a number of villages,  including Totley, Dore and the area now known as Mosborough Townships. Directly to the west of the city are the Peak District National Park and the Pennine hill range, while the lowlands of the South Yorkshire Coalfield lie to the east.\n\nSheffield is a geographically diverse city.  The city nestles in a natural amphitheatre created by several hills  forming the eastern foothills of the Pennines, and the confluence of five rivers: Don, Sheaf, Rivelin, Loxley and Porter. As such, much of the city is built on hillsides with views into the city centre or out to the countryside. The city's lowest point is just 29 m above sea level near Blackburn Meadows, while some parts of the city are at over 500 m; the highest point being 548 m at High Stones, near Margery Hill. However, 79% of the housing in the city is between 100 and above sea level. \n\nEstimated to contain over two million trees,  Sheffield has more trees per person than any other city in Europe, and according to Sheffield City Council, it is England's greenest city,  a claim that was reinforced when it won the 2005 Entente Florale competition. It has over 170 woodlands (covering ), 78 public parks (covering ) and 10 public gardens. Added to the  of national park and  of water this means that 61% of the city is greenspace. Despite this, about 64% of Sheffield householders live further than 300 m from their nearest greenspace, although access is better in less affluent neighbourhoods across the city.  Since 2012 there have been disputes between the city council and residents over the fate of the city's 36,000 highway trees, with 2000 having been felled by October 2015 as part of the £2 billion Streets Ahead road improvement scheme. \n\nSheffield also has a very wide variety of habitat, comparing favourably with any city in the United Kingdom: urban, parkland and woodland, agricultural and arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater-based habitats. There are six areas within the city that are designated as sites of special scientific interest. \n\nThe present city boundaries were set in 1974 (with slight modification in 1994), when the former county borough of Sheffield merged with Stocksbridge Urban District and two parishes from the Wortley Rural District. This area includes a significant part of the countryside surrounding the main urban region. Roughly a third of Sheffield lies in the Peak District National Park. No other English city included parts of a national park within its boundary,  until the creation in March 2010 of the South Downs National Park, part of which lies within Brighton and Hove.\n\nClimate\n\nLike the rest of the United Kingdom, the climate in Sheffield is generally temperate. The Pennines to the west of the city can create a cool, gloomy and wet environment, but they also provide shelter from the prevailing westerly winds, casting a \"rain shadow\" across the area.  Between 1971 and 2000 Sheffield averaged  of rain per year; December was the wettest month with  and July the driest with . July was also the hottest month, with an average maximum temperature of . The average minimum temperature in January and February was ,  though the lowest temperatures recorded in these months can be between , although since 1960, the temperature has never fallen below ,  suggesting that urbanisation around the Weston Park site during the second half of the 20th century may prevent temperatures below  occurring.\n\nThe coldest temperature to be recorded in recent years was .  (Note: The official Weston Park Weather Station statistics, which can also be viewed at Sheffield Central Library, has the temperature at , recorded on 20 December, and states that to be the lowest December temperature since 1981.)\n\nThe coldest temperature ever recorded in the city of Sheffield at Weston Park, since records began in 1882, is , registered in February 1895. The lowest daytime maximum temperature in the city since records began is , also recorded in February 1895.\n\nMore recently, a  was recorded as a daytime maximum at Weston Park, on 20 December 2010.(from the Weston Park Weather Station statistics, which also can be viewed at Sheffield Central Library.)\n\nOn average, through the winter months of December to March, there are 67 days during which ground frost occurs.\n\nThe Weston Park Weather station, established in 1882, is one of the longest running weather stations in the United Kingdom. It has recorded weather for more than 125 years, and a 2008 report showed that the climate of Sheffield is warming faster than it has at any time during this period, with 1990 and 2006 being the hottest years on record.  In collaboration with the Stockholm Environment Institute, Sheffield developed a carbon footprint (based on 2004/05 consumption figures) of 5,798,361 tonnes per year. This compares to the UK's total carbon footprint of 698,568,010 tonnes per year. The factors with the greatest impact are housing (34%), transport (25%), consumer (11%), private services (9%), public services (8%), food (8%) and capital investment (5%).  Sheffield City Council has signed up to the 10:10 campaign. \n\nSubdivisions\n\nSheffield is made up of many suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or hamlets that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew. These historical areas are largely ignored by the modern administrative and political divisions of the city; instead it is divided into 28 electoral wards, with each ward generally covering 4–6 areas.  These electoral wards are grouped into six parliamentary constituencies. Sheffield is largely unparished, but Bradfield and Ecclesfield have parish councils, and Stocksbridge has a town council. \n\nDemography\n\nThe United Kingdom Census 2001 reported a resident population for Sheffield of 513,234, a 2% decline from the 1991 census.  The city is part of the wider Sheffield urban area, which had a population of 640,720.  In 2011 the racial composition of Sheffield's population was 84% White (81% White British, 0.5% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy or Irish Traveller, 2.3% Other White), 2.4% of mixed race (1.0% White and Black Caribbean, 0.2% White and Black African, 0.6% White and Asian, 0.6% Other Mixed), 8% Asian (1.1% Indian, 4% Pakistani, 0.6% Bangladeshi, 1.3% Chinese, 1.0% Other Asian), 3.6% Black (2.1% African, 1% Caribbean, 0.5% Other Black), 1.5% Arab and 0.7% of other ethnic heritage.  In terms of religion, 53% of the population are Christian, 6% are Muslim, 0.6% are Hindu, 0.4% are Buddhist, 0.2% are Sikh, 0.1% are Jewish, 0.4% belong to another religion, 31% have no religion and 7% did not state their religion.  The largest quinary group is 20- to 24-year-olds (9%) because of the large university student population. \n\nThe population of Sheffield peaked in 1951 at 577,050, and has since declined steadily. However, the mid-2007 population estimate was 530,300, representing an increase of about 17,000 residents since 2001. \n\nAlthough a city, Sheffield is informally known as \"the largest village in England\", because of a combination of topographical isolation and demographic stability. It is relatively geographically isolated, being cut off from other places by a ring of hills. (Local folklore insists that, like Rome, Sheffield was built \"on seven hills\".) The land surrounding Sheffield was unsuitable for industrial use, and now includes several protected green belt areas. These topographical factors have served to restrict urban spread, resulting in a relatively stable population size and a low degree of mobility.\n\nEconomy\n\nAfter many years of decline, the Sheffield economy is going through a strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study  revealed that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank  revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents during the second half of 2004. This can be seen by the current surge of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul's Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment,  the forthcoming NRQ and the recently completed Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and many projects under the Sheffield One redevelopment agency. The Sheffield economy grew from £5.6 billion in 1997 (1997 GVA)  to £9.2 billion in 2007 (2007 GVA). \n\nThe \"UK Cities Monitor 2008\" placed Sheffield among the top ten \"best cities to locate a business today\", the city occupying third and fourth places respectively for best office location and best new call centre location. The same report places Sheffield in third place regarding \"greenest reputation\" and second in terms of the availability of financial incentives. \n\nSheffield has an international reputation for metallurgy and steel-making.  Many innovations in these fields have been made in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth.  This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18th century. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912,  and the work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels.  Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations.  Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (CTI), The Welding Institute (TWI),  and William Cook Group.  \n\nForgemasters, founded in 1805, is the sole remaining independent steel works in the world and dominates the north east of Sheffield around the Lower Don Valley. The firm has a global reputation for producing the largest and most complex steel forgings and castings and is certified to produce critical nuclear components, with recent projects including the Royal Navy's Astute class submarines.  The firm also has the capacity for pouring the largest single ingot (570 tonnes) in Europe and is currently in the process of expanding its capabilities. \n\nWhile iron and steel have long been the main industries of Sheffield, coal mining has also been a major industry, particularly in the outlying areas, and the Palace of Westminster in London was built using limestone from quarries in the nearby village of Anston. Other areas of employment include call centres, the City Council, universities and hospitals.\n\nSheffield is a major retail centre, and is home to many High Street and department stores as well as designer boutiques.  The main shopping areas in the city centre are on The Moor precinct, Fargate, Orchard Square and the Devonshire Quarter. Department stores in the city centre include John Lewis, Marks and Spencer, Atkinsons and Debenhams. Sheffield's main market was once Castle Market, built above the remains of the castle. This is due to be demolished.  Sheffield Moor market opened in 2013. Shopping areas outside the city centre include the Meadowhall shopping centre and retail park, Ecclesall Road, London Road, Hillsborough, Firth Park and the Crystal Peaks shopping centre. In a 2010 survey of forecast expenditure at retail centres in the United Kingdom, Meadowhall was ranked 12th and Sheffield City Centre 19th. \n\nSheffield has a District Energy system that exploits the city's domestic waste, by incinerating it and converting the energy from it to electricity. It also provides hot water, which is distributed through over 25 mi of pipes under the city, via two networks. These networks supply heat and hot water for many buildings throughout the city. These include not only cinemas, hospitals, shops and offices, but also universities (Sheffield Hallam University and the University of Sheffield), and residential properties.  Energy generated in a waste plant produces 60 megawatts of thermal energy and up to 19 megawatts of electrical energy from 225,000 tonnes of waste. \n\nIn 2012, Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone was launched to promote development in a number of sites in Sheffield and across the wider region. In March 2014 additional sites were added to the zone. \n\nTransport\n\nNational and international travel\n\nRoad\n\nSheffield is linked into the national motorway network via the M1 and M18 motorways.  The M1 skirts the north-east of the city, linking Sheffield with London to the south and Leeds to the north, and crosses Tinsley Viaduct near Rotherham; the M18 branches from the M1 close to Sheffield, linking the city with Doncaster, Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield Airport, and the Humber ports. The Sheffield Parkway connects the city centre with the motorways.\n\nRail\n\nMajor railway routes through Sheffield railway station include the Midland Main Line, which links the city to London via the East Midlands, the Cross Country Route which links the East of Scotland and Northeast of England with the West Midlands and the Southwest, and the lines linking Liverpool and Manchester with Hull and East Anglia.  With the redevelopment of London St Pancras station (now St Pancras International) complete, Sheffield has a direct connection to continental Europe. East Midlands Trains run services to St Pancras International and Eurostar run services from there to France and Belgium.  The Master Cutler, a named passenger express train running from Sheffield railway station to London St Pancras, provides a direct connection to the capital.\n\nThe coalition government announced in October 2010 that Sheffield would be included in the proposed High Speed Rail network connecting the North of England with London.  The plan will see Sheffield and Leeds served by the same line which will connect with another to Manchester just south of Birmingham, with London Euston station being the probable London terminus.  Construction of the Yorkshire/East Midlands High Speed line is likely to begin 2025 and services begin operation in 2032.\n\nOther trains serving Sheffield (apart from East Midland Trains) are provided by CrossCountry, TransPennine Express and Northern. Aside from the main railway station there are five other stations in Sheffield. Meadowhall, a bus, rail and tram interchange, is the second largest station and accommodates a number of services including the long distance CrossCountry service. Dore and Totley, Woodhouse, Chapeltown and Darnall stations serve as commuter stations for suburban communities but are also connected to the national rail network.\n\nCoach\n\nCoach services running through Sheffield are operated by National Express and to a lesser extent Megabus, part of the Stagecoach Group. National Express services call at Sheffield Interchange, Meadowhall Interchange and Meadowhead Bus Stop. Megabus services only call at Meadowhall. National Express services 564, 560, 350, 320, 310 and 240 call at Sheffield, as do others on a less frequent basis.  The 560/564 service is a direct connection to London Victoria Coach Station via Chesterfield and Milton Keynes, operating 12 times a day in both directions. The 350 and 240 services connect Sheffield to Manchester Airport and Heathrow/Gatwick Airports respectively.  Two Megabus services, the M12 and M20, call at Sheffield en route to London from Newcastle upon Tyne and Inverness respectively. \n\nCanal\n\nThe Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation (S&SY) is a system of navigable inland waterways (canals and canalised rivers) in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.  Chiefly based on the River Don, it runs for a length of 43 mi and has 29 locks. It connects Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster with the River Trent at Keadby and (via the New Junction Canal) the Aire and Calder Navigation. \n\nAir\n\nFollowing the closure of Sheffield City Airport in 2008, the closest international airport to Sheffield is Doncaster Sheffield Airport, which is located 18 mi less than 40 minutes from the city centre. It operates on the site of the former RAF Finningley. DSA airport opened on 28 April 2005 and is served mainly by charter and budget airlines. It handles about one million passengers a year. \n\nA new link road, due to open in January 2016, will connect Doncaster Sheffield Airport to the M18 motorway, reducing the journey time from Sheffield city centre from 40 to 25 minutes. \n\nEast Midlands Airport is within one hour's drive of the city, and Manchester Airport is connected directly to Sheffield by a direct train every hour.\n\nLocal travel\n\nThe A57 and A61 roads are the major trunk roads through Sheffield. These run east–west and north–south respectively, crossing in the city centre, from where the other major roads generally radiate spoke-like. An inner ring road, mostly constructed in the 1970s and extended in 2007 to form a complete ring,  allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an outer ring road runs to the east, south east and north, nearer the edge of the city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.\n\nSheffield does not have as extensive a suburban and inter-urban railway network as other comparable British cities.  However, there are several local rail routes running along the city's valleys and beyond, connecting it with other parts of South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire. These local routes include the Penistone Line, the Dearne Valley Line, the Hope Valley Line and the Hallam Line. As well as the main stations of Sheffield and Meadowhall, there are five suburban stations, at Chapeltown, Darnall, Woodhouse, Dronfield and Dore. \n\nThe Sheffield Supertram (not derived from the previous tramways), operated by Stagecoach, opened in 1994, shortly after the similar Metrolink scheme in Manchester. Its network consists of 37 mi of track and three lines, from Halfway to Malin Bridge (Blue Line), from Meadowhall to Middlewood (Yellow Line), and from Meadowhall to Herdings Park (Purple Line), with all three lines running via the city centre.  The system contains both on-street and segregated running, depending upon the section and line.\n\nThe Supertram serves as an important connection between areas in the North East of Sheffield (namely Meadowhall and Valley Centertainment) and the city centre. Because it is operated by the Stagecoach Group, the ticketing system for the Supertram is integrated with Stagecoach buses in Sheffield, meaning passengers can switch between the two modes of transport without having to buy a separate ticket.  The network is due to be extended to Rotherham Parkgate by 2017, with a fleet of new \"train-trams\" sharing a conventional rail line between Sheffield and Rotherham.\n\nSheffield's local bus infrastructure has its main hub at Sheffield Interchange. Other bus stations lie at Halfway, Hillsborough and Meadowhall. A flurry of new operators was created after deregulation in 1986,  though a series of mergers has reduced the number. \n\nThere are numerous bus operators within Sheffield: First South Yorkshire, Stagecoach Yorkshire, TM Travel, Hulleys of Baslow, Powells, G&J Holmes and Sheffield Community Transport. First South Yorkshire, became by far the largest bus operator and in recent years implemented a series of fare rises and service cuts which saw bus ridership drop.   Recent developments have seen Stagecoach Sheffield taking over Yorkshire Terrier, Andrews and parent company Yorkshire Traction, thus forming one company and in the process expanding their bus services in the city. This has resulted in increased competition, and price drops on certain routes.  A zero-fare bus service, the FreeBee (Operated by First South Yorkshire), operated a circular route around the city centre from the Sheffield Interchange. The FreeBee buses stopped in 2014 and is due to save £8 million. \n \n\nIn 2008, the Bus Rapid Transit Scheme between Sheffield and Rotherham was approved by the Yorkshire and Humber Assembly's Regional Transport Board. There are plans for two routes; one (the Northern route) via Meadowhall and Templeborough, and the other via the developing employment centre and Waverley. \n\nCycling\n\nFor cycling, although hilly, Sheffield is compact and has few major trunk roads. It is on the Trans-Pennine Trail, a National Cycle Network route running from West to East from Southport in Merseyside to Hornsea in the East Riding of Yorkshire and North to South from Leeds in West Yorkshire to Chesterfield in Derbyshire.  There are many cycle routes going along country paths in the woods surrounding the city.\n\nEducation\n\nUniversities and colleges\n\nSheffield has two universities, the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University. The two combined bring about 65,000 students to the city every year.   Sheffield University was established in 1897 as University College Sheffield and became the University of Sheffield in 1905.\n\nSheffield Hallam University (SHU) is a university on two sites in Sheffield. City Campus is located in the city centre, close to Sheffield railway station, and Collegiate Crescent Campus is about two miles away, adjacent to Ecclesall Road in south-west Sheffield. The university is the third largest in the UK, with more than 37,000 students (of whom over 4,000 are international students), 4,170 staff and 747 courses. Sheffield Hallam University's history goes back to 1843 with the establishment of the Sheffield School of Design. During the 1960s several independent colleges (including the School of Design) joined to become Sheffield Polytechnic (Sheffield City Polytechnic from 1976) and was finally renamed Sheffield Hallam University in 1992.\n\nSheffield has three main further education providers, The Sheffield College, Longley Park Sixth Form College and Chapeltown Academy. The Sheffield College is organised on a federal basis and was originally created from the merger of six colleges around the city, since reduced to just four: Sheffield City (formerly Castle)  near the city centre, Hillsborough, serving the north of the city and Norton and Peaks to the south.\n\nSecondary, primary and pre-school education\n\nThere are 137 primary schools, 26 secondary schools – of which 9 have sixth forms: (High Storrs, King Ecgberts, King Edward VII, Silverdale, Meadowhead, Tapton, UTC Sheffield, Notre Dame Catholic High and All Saints Catholic High ) – and a sixth-form college, Longley Park Sixth Form College.  The city's five independent private schools include Birkdale School and the Sheffield High School.  There are also 12 special schools and a number of Integrated Resource Units in mainstream schools which are, along with all other schools, managed by Sheffield City Council.  All schools are non-selective, mixed sex schools (apart from Sheffield High School which is an all-girls school).\nThe Early Years Education and Childcare Service of Sheffield City Council manages 32 nurseries and children's centres in the city.\n\nSport\n\nSheffield has a long sporting heritage. In 1857 a collective of cricketers formed the world's first-ever official football club, Sheffield F.C.,  and the world's second-ever, Hallam F.C., who also play at the world's oldest football ground in the suburb of Crosspool. Sheffield and Hallam are today Sheffield's two major non-league sides, although Sheffield now play just outside the city in nearby Dronfield, Derbyshire. Sheffield and Hallam contest what has become known as the Sheffield derby. By 1860 there were 15 football clubs in Sheffield, with the first ever amateur league and cup competitions taking place in the city. \n\n Sheffield is best known for its two professional football teams, Sheffield United, known locally as The Blades, and Sheffield Wednesday, known locally as The Owls. United, who play at Bramall Lane south of the city centre, compete in the Football League One, whilst Wednesday, who play at Hillsborough in the north west of the city, compete in the Football League Championship. The two clubs contest the Steel City Derby, which is considered by many to be one of the most fierce football rivalries in English Football.  In the pre-war era, both Wednesday and United enjoyed large amounts of success and found themselves two of the country's top clubs; Sheffield Wednesday became champions of the Football League consecutively in 1902–03 and 1903–04, then again in 1928–29, whilst Sheffield United had won it in 1897–98. In the FA Cup the teams were also two of the forerunners, United winning it on 4 occasions and Wednesday on 3. Post war, and Wednesday were beaten finalists in the 1966 FA cup. During the 1970s and early 1980s the two sides fell from grace, with Wednesday finding themselves in the Third Division by the mid 70s and United as far as the Fourth Division in 1981. Wednesday once again became one of England's high-flying clubs following promotion back to the First Division in 1984, winning the League Cup in 1991, competing in the UEFA Cup in 1992–93, and reaching the final of both the League Cup and FA Cup in the same season. United and Wednesday were both founding members of the Premier League in 1992, but The Blades were relegated in 1994. The Owls remained until 2000. Both clubs have gone into decline in the 21st Century, Wednesday twice relegated to League One and United suffering the same fate in 2011, despite a brief spell in the Premier League in 2006–07. Sheffield Wednesday's new owner Dejphon Chansiri is aiming for promotion back to the Premier League by 2017. \n\nRotherham United, who play in the Championship, did play their home games in the city between 2008 and 2012, having moved to play at Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium in 2008 following a dispute with their previous landlord at their traditional home ground of Millmoor, Rotherham. However, in July 2012, the club moved to the new 12,000 seat New York Stadium in Rotherham, whilst United and Wednesday contest the Steel City derby. There are also facilities for golf, climbing and bowling, as well as a newly inaugurated national ice-skating arena (IceSheffield).\n\nSheffield Eagles RLFC are the city's professional Rugby league team who play their matches at Owlerton Stadium. They currently play in the second tier of the professional league, the Championship and are current champions, having won back to back titles in 2012 and 2013.\nTheir most successful moment came in 1998, when, against all the odds they defeated Wigan Warriors in the Challenge Cup final, despite being huge underdogs. The team then hit troubled times before reforming in 2003. Since then they have played their rugby in the Championship (second tier). In 2011, they made the playoffs finishing in fifth place. They made the Grand Final, by defeating Leigh, who were huge favourites in a playoff semi final. In the final, they were comprehensively beaten by Featherstone. Sheffield also put in a bid to be a host city for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, but their bid was unsuccessful.\n\nSheffield is also home to the Sheffield Steelers ice hockey team who play out of the 8,500 seater Sheffield Arena. They play in the 10 team professional Elite Ice Hockey League.\nMany of Sheffield's sporting facilities were built for the World Student Games, which the city hosted in 1991, including Sheffield Arena and the Ponds Forge international diving and swimming complex. Ponds Forge is also the home of Sheffield City Swimming Club, a local swimming club competing in the Speedo league. The former Don Valley International Athletics Stadium, once the largest athletics stadium in the UK, was also constructed for the Universiade games. \nThe Sheffield Ski Village was the largest artificial ski resort in Europe, before being destroyed in a series of suspected arson attacks in 2012 and 2013. The city also has two indoor climbing centres. Sheffield was the UK's first National City of Sport and is now home to the English Institute of Sport – Sheffield, where British athletes trained for the 2012 Olympics. \n\nSheffield also has close ties with snooker, with the city's Crucible Theatre being the venue for the World Snooker Championships.  The English Institute of Sport hosts most of the top fencing competitions each year, including the National Championships for Seniors, Juniors (U20's) and Cadets (U17's) as well as the 2011 Senior European Fencing Championships. The English squash open is also held in the city every year. The International Open and World Matchplay Championship bowls tournaments have both been held at Ponds Forge.  The city also hosts the Sheffield Tigers rugby union, Sheffield Sharks basketball, Sheffield University Bankers hockey, Sheffield Steelers ice hockey and Sheffield Tigers speedway teams. Sheffield also has many golf courses all around the city.\n\nSheffield was selected as a candidate host city by the Football Association (FA) as part of the English 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid on 16 December 2009. \nHillsborough Stadium was chosen as the proposed venue for matches in Sheffield. \nThe bid failed.\n\nThe National Hockey League's Stanley Cup was made in Sheffield in 1892. Sheffield is also home to the Sheffield Steel Rollergirls, a roller derby team.\n\nSheffield hosted the finish of Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France. Within the City limits and located just 4 km from the finish, was the ninth and final climb of the stage, the Category 4 Côte de Jenkin Road. The one point in the King of the Mountains Competition was claimed by Chris Froome of Team Sky. The climb was just  long at an average gradient of 10.8%. The stage was won by the eventual overall winner, Vincenzo Nibali of Astana Pro Team. \n\nCulture and attractions\n\nSheffield made the shortlist for the first city to be designated UK City of Culture, but in July 2010 it was announced that Derry had been selected. \n\nAttractions\n\nThe Sheffield Walk of Fame in the City Centre honours famous Sheffield residents past and present in a similar way to the Hollywood version.  Sheffield also had its own Ferris Wheel known as the Wheel of Sheffield, located atop Fargate shopping precinct. The Wheel was dismantled in October 2010 and moved to London's Hyde Park.  Heeley City Farm and Graves Park are home to Sheffield's two farm animal collections, both of which are fully open to the public.  \n\nThere are about 1,100 listed buildings in Sheffield (including the whole of the Sheffield postal district).  Of these, only five are Grade I listed. Fifty-nine are Grade II*, but the overwhelming majority are listed as Grade II.  Compared to other English cities, Sheffield has few buildings with the highest Grade I listing: Liverpool, for example, has 26 Grade I listed buildings. This situation led the noted architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in 1959, to comment that the city was \"architecturally a miserable disappointment\", with no pre-19th-century buildings of any distinction.  By contrast, in November 2007, Sheffield's Peace and Winter Gardens beat London's South Bank to gain the Royal Institute of British Architects' Academy of Urbanism \"Great Place\" Award, as an \"outstanding example of how cities can be improved, to make urban spaces as attractive and accessible as possible\". \n\nMusic\n\nSheffield has been home to several well-known bands and musicians, with a notably large number of synthpop and other electronic bands originating from the city.  These include The Human League, Heaven 17, ABC and the more industrially inclined Cabaret Voltaire & Clock DVA. This electronic tradition has continued: techno label Warp Records was a central pillar of the Yorkshire Bleeps and Bass scene of the early 1990s, and has gone on to become one of the UK's oldest and best-loved dance music labels. More recently, other popular genres of electronic music such as bassline house have originated in the city.  Sheffield was once home to a number of historically important nightclubs in the early dance music scene of the 1980s and 90s, Gatecrasher One was one of the most popular clubs in the North of England until its destruction by fire on 18 June 2007. \n\nA number of major music acts, including Joe Cocker, Def Leppard, Paul Carrack (of Mike + The Mechanics), Arctic Monkeys, Bring Me the Horizon, Pulp and Moloko, hail from the city.     Indie band The Long Blondes originated from the city,  as part of what the NME dubbed the New Yorkshire scene. \n\nIn 1999, the National Centre for Popular Music, a museum dedicated to the subject of popular music, was opened in the city.  It was not as successful as was hoped, however, and later evolved to become a live music venue; then in February 2005, the unusual steel-covered building became the students' union for Sheffield Hallam University.  Live music venues in the city include the Harley Hotel, Leadmill, West Street Live, the Boardwalk, Dove & Rainbow, The Casbah, The Cremorne, Corporation, New Barrack Tavern, The Broadfield Hotel, Redstone bar and nightclub, the City Hall, the University of Sheffield Students' Union, the Studio Theatre at the Crucible Theatre, the O2 Academy Sheffield and The Grapes.      \n\nSheffield hosts a number of festivals, the Grin Up North Sheffield Comedy Festival,  the Sensoria Music & Film Festival and the Tramlines Festival. The Tramlines Festival was launched as an annual music festival in 2009,  it is held throughout venues in Sheffield City Centre, and features local and national artists.  The city is also home to several local orchestras and choirs, such as the Sheffield Symphony Orchestra, the Sheffield Philharmonic Orchestra, the Sheffield Chamber Orchestra, the City of Sheffield Youth Orchestra, the Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus and the Chorus UK community choir.    \n\nTheatres\n\nSheffield has two large theatres, the Lyceum Theatre and the Crucible Theatre, which together with the smaller Studio Theatre make up the largest theatre complex outside London, located in Tudor Square.  The Crucible Theatre is the home (since 1977) of the World Snooker Championships and hosts many well-known stage productions throughout the year. The Lyceum, which opened in 1897, serves as a venue for touring West End productions and operas by Opera North, as well as locally produced shows. Sheffield also has the Montgomery Theatre, a small 420 seater theatre located a short distance from Tudor Square, opposite the town hall on Surrey Street.  There are also a large number of smaller amateur theatres scattered throughout the city.\n\nMuseums\n\nSheffield's museums are managed by two distinct organisations. Museums Sheffield manages the Weston Park Museum (a Grade II* listed Building), Millennium Galleries and Graves Art Gallery.  Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust manages the museums dedicated to Sheffield's industrial heritage of which there are three.  Kelham Island Museum (located just to the North of the city centre) showcases the city's history of steel manufacturing.  Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet (in the south of the city) is a Grade I Listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.  Shepherd Wheel (in the south-East of the city) is a former water-powered grinding workshop, Grade II listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. \n\nGreenspace\n\nSheffield has a reputed 2 million trees and is known as the greenest city in Europe. \nConsequently, there are many parks and woods throughout the city and beyond. There are 83 parks in Sheffield (13 'City' Parks, 20 'District' Parks and 50 'Local' Parks) which are located throughout the city.  Included in the city parks category are 3 of Sheffield's 6 public gardens (The Sheffield Botanical Gardens, The Peace Gardens and Hillsborough Walled Gardens, with the Sheffield Winter Gardens, Beauchief Gardens and Lynwood Gardens being the separate entities). \n\nThe Sheffield Botanical Gardens are on a 19-acre site located to the south west of the city centre and date back to 1836. The site includes a large, Grade II listed, Victorian era glasshouse. The Peace Gardens, neighboured next to the Town Hall and forming part of the Heart of the City project, occupy a 0.67 hectare site in the centre of the city. The site is dominated by its water features, principle among which is the Goodwin Fountain. Made up of 89 individual jets of water, this fountain lies at the corner of the quarter-circle shaped Peace Gardens and is named after a notable Sheffield industrialist. Since their redevelopment in 1998, the Peace gardens have received a number of regional and national accolades.  Hillsborough Walled Garden is located in Hillsborough Park, to the north west of the city centre. The gardens date back to 1779 and have been dedicated to the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster since the redevelopment of the gardens in the early 1990s.  The Winter Garden, lying within the Heart of the City, is a large wood framed, glass skinned greenhouse housing some 2,500 plants from around the world. \n\nAlso within the city there are a number of nature reserves which when combined occupy 1600 acre of land.  There are also 170 woodland areas within the city, 80 of which are classed as ancient.\n\nThe South West boundary of the city overlaps with the Peak District National Park, the first national park in England (est. 1951).  As a consequence, several communities actually reside within both entities. The Peak District is home to many notable, natural, features and also man-made features such as Chatsworth House, the setting for the BBC series Pride and Prejudice. \n\nSheffield City Council has created a new chain of parks spanning the hill side behind Sheffield Station. The park, known as Sheaf Valley Park, has an open-air amphitheatre and will include an arboretum.  The site was once home to a medieval deer park, latterly owned by the Duke of Norfolk.\n\nEntertainment\n\nSheffield has five cinema complexes, three of which are in the city centre and a further two in the Lower Don Valley. One of these complexes is located at Valley Centertainment, a leisure and entertainment complex in the Don Valley. It was built on land previously occupied by steel mills near what is now Meadowhall and the Sheffield Arena. It is home to several restaurants, bars, a cinema multiplex and a bowling alley.  It is also the largest Cineworld complex in the United Kingdom, containing 20 screens in one building.  Odeon Sheffield, situated on Arundel Gate in the city Centre and Vue, located within Meadowhall Shopping Centre, are the two other mainstream cinemas in the city. The Showroom, an independent cinema showing non-mainstream productions, is located in Sheaf Square, close to Sheffield station. In 2002 the Showroom was voted as the best Independent cinema in the country by Guardian readers.   A Curzon Cinemas complex has also recently opened in the city centre, close to the existing Odeon complex. The cinema is based in the former Sheffield Banking Company building, located just off Arundel Gate. The cinema features 4K resolution projectors and was opened in January 2015.  \n\nOwing to its long history, Sheffield has a large number of pubs throughout the city. West Street, running through the heart of the West End district of the city centre, is home to many pubs, bars and clubs and attracts many student visitors. A recent addition to the city's nightlife is Leopold Square, situated just off the northern end of West Street. Aagrah, an Indian restaurant in the square which serves Kashmiri cuisine, has recently been voted \"Best Restaurant Group in the UK\" at the prestigious British Curry Awards. \n\nMedia and film\n\nSheffield has two commercial newspapers, The Star  and Sheffield Telegraph, both published by Johnston Press PLC. The Star has been published daily since 1897; the Sheffield Telegraph, now a weekly publication, originated in 1855. \n\nSheffield has its own TV station; Sheffield Live TV, a not-for-profit company which began broadcasting on 23 September 2014.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-29322248] SLTV has been awarded a 12-year licence to provide the digital terrestrial broadcasting service.

F.I.S.T. and Kill List also include several scenes filmed in Sheffield and a substantial part of Among Giants  was filmed in the city. The documentary festival Sheffield Doc/Fest has been run annually since 1994 at the Showroom Cinema,  and in 2007 Sheffield hosted the Awards of the International Indian Film Academy. \n\nPublic services\n\nSheffield is policed by South Yorkshire Police (a territorial police force) whose headquarters are in the city. Sheffield constitutes one of its four Basic Command Units (Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham being the other three).  The force polices an area of approximately 1,554 square kilometres and is the 13th largest force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The force has in its possession one Police helicopter, known as Sierra Yankee 99. \n\nMedical services in Sheffield are provided by three NHS Foundation Trusts. Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust provides healthcare to people (primarily adults) throughout Sheffield and South Yorkshire.
