        "query": "The number of tornadoes recorded annually in North America has more than tripled since 1953. Yet meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged.Q: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above? Answer Choices: (A)The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were not well known to meteorologists before 1953. (B)The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953. (C)The number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years. (D)The amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953. (E)Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.\nA: Among A through E, the answer is",

        "query": "Politician: Union leaders argue that increases in multinational control of manufacturing have shifted labor to nations without strong worker protections, resulting in a corresponding global decrease in workers' average wages. Given that these leaders have a vested interest in seeing wages remain high, they would naturally want to convince legislators to oppose multinational control.

So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.Q: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments? Answer Choices: (A)If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely. (B)If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. (C)Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure. (D)If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely. (E)If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.\nA: Among A through E, the answer is",
