        "query": "Global wanning has contributed to a rise in global sea level not only because it causes glaciers and ice sheets to melt, but also simply because when water is heated its volume increases. But this rise in global sea level is less than it otherwise would be, since over the years artificial reservoirs have been built all around the world that collectively contain a great deal of water that would otherwise reach the sea.Q: Which one of the following can most reasonably be concluded on the basis of the information above? Answer Choices: (A)The exact magnitude of the rise in global sea level is in dispute. (B)Rises in global sea level that occurred before the world's reservoirs were built are difficult to explain. (C)Little is known about the contribution of global warming to the rise in global sea level. (D)The amount of water in the world's reservoirs is about equal to the amount of water that results from the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. (E)The amount of water that results from the melting of glaciers and ice sheets cannot be determined by looking at the rise in global sea level alone.\nA: Among A through E, the answer is",

Over time, the dogs who went unrewarded began to disobey the command. This shows that dogs have an aversion to being treated unfairly.Q: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument? Answer Choices: (A)Were dogs who were accustomed to receiving regular rewards prior to the study more inclined to obey the command? (B)Is there a decline in obedience if rewards are withheld from both dogs in the pair? (C)Were dogs who received treats in one trial ever used as dogs that did not receive treats in other trials?
