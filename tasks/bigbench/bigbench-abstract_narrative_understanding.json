Jim, who was a bin man, loved when work took him down this street. He loved looking at the big rich houses and imagined what it would be like living there. Jim rarely saw the inhabitants of this road, however, one day as he was dragging a bin towards the truck, an inhabitant ran up to him and asked him politely, if he could wait. He added to the trash and then, thanking Jim, shook his hand and wished him a nice day.\nThis narrative is a good illustration of the following proverb:",
