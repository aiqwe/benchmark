Most of its residents were Canadians who enjoyed the cheap housing and cheap gas there.  When the centuries-old Point Roberts territorial dispute flared up again, the residents joined protests to support Canadian national sovereignty.  They also joined protests to keep the enclave in the U.S. to help preserve their access to cheap gas.  But when the dispute escalated to a near-war, all two-faced protesters were identified by video footage and arrested for treason.\nThis narrative is a good illustration of the following proverb:",
