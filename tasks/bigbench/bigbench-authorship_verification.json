Is it not dreadful?' 'It is, my dearest girl,' replied I; 'but every feeling has been sacrificed to worldly considerations and an empty name. The younger sons have been neglected, if not deserted. Virtue, talent, everything set at naught--intrinsic value despised--and the only claim to consideration admitted, that of being the heir entail. When all the ties of nature are cast loose by the parents, can you be surprised if the children are no longer bound by them? Most truly do you observe, that it is a detestable state of society.' 'I did not say detestable, brother; I said strange and unnatural.' 'Had you said what I said, Ellen, you would not have been wrong. I would not, for the title and wealth which it brings, be the heartless, isolated, I may say neglected, being that my grandfather was: were it offered now, I would not barter for it Ellen's love.' Ellen threw herself in my arms; we then walked into the garden, where we had a long conversation relative to our future wishes, hopes and, prospects. CHAPTER FORTY ONE. POMPOUS OBSEQUIES--THE READING OF THE WILL, NOT EXACTLY AFTER WILKIE--I AM LEFT A LEGACY--WHAT BECOMES OF IT--MY FATHER, VERY WARM, WRITES A SERMON TO COOL HIMSELF--I JOIN O'BRIEN'S BRIG, AND FALL IN WITH SWINBURNE. On that day week I accompanied my father to Eagle Park, to assist at the burial of Lord Privilege. We were ushered into the room where the body had lain in state for three days. The black hangings, the lofty plumes, the rich ornaments on the coffin, and the number of wax candles, with which the room was lighted, produced a solemn and grand effect. I could not help, as I leaned against the balustrade before the coffin, and thought of its contents, calling to mind when my poor grandfather's feelings seemed, as it were, inclined to thaw in my favour, when he called me 'his child,' and, in all probability, had not my uncle had a son, would have died in my arms, fond and attached to me for my own sake, independently of worldly considerations. I felt that had I known him longer, I could have loved him, and that he would have loved me; and I thought to myself how little all these empty honours, after his decease, could compensate for the loss of those reciprocal feelings, which would have so added to his happiness during his existence. But he had lived for pomp and vanity; and pomp and vanity attended him to his grave. I thought of my sister Ellen, and of O'Brien, and walked away with the conviction that Peter Simple might have been an object of envy to the late Right Honourable Lord Viscount Privilege, Baron Corston, Lord Lieutenant of the county, and one of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Councillors.\"\n  choice: \"'Surely this is a great sum of money,' observed Humphrey. 'I don't know what is the price of things; but it appears to me, that it ought to last us a long while.' 'I think so too,' replied Edward. 'I wish Oswald Partridge would come, for I want to ask him many questions. I don't know the price of flour, or anything else we have to purchase, nor do I know what I ought to be paid for venison. I don't like to go to Lymington till I see him for that reason. If he does not come soon, I shall ride over and see what is the matter.' Edward then replaced the money in the chest, and he and Humphrey then went out to the farmyard to go on with their work. It was not until six weeks after the death of old Jacob that Oswald Partridge made his appearance. 'How is the old man, sir?' was his first question. 'He was buried a few days after you left,' replied Edward. 'I expected as much,' said the forester. 'Peace be with him--he was a good man. And how is your arm?' 'Nearly well,' replied Edward. 'Now sit down, Oswald, for I have a great deal to say to you; and first, let me ask you what has detained you from coming here according to your promise?' 'Simply, and in few words--murder.' 'Murder!' exclaimed Edward. 'Yes, deliberate murder, sir; in short, they have beheaded King Charles, our sovereign.' 'Have they dared to do it?' 'They have,' replied Oswald. 'We in the forest know little that is going on; but when I saw you last, I heard that he was then in London, and was to be tried.' 'Tried!' exclaimed Edward. 'How could they try a king? by the laws of our country, a man must be tried by his equals; and where were his equals?' 'Majesty becomes naught, I suppose,' replied Oswald; 'but still it is as I say. Two days after you left, the intendant hastened up to London, and, from what I have understood, he was strongly opposed to the deed, and did all he could to prevent it; but it was of no use. When he left, he gave me strict injunctions not to go away from the cottage for an hour, as his daughter was left alone; and as I promised, I could not come to you; but, nevertheless, Patience received letters from him, and told me what I tell you.' 'You have not dined, Oswald?' said Edward. 'No, that I have not.' 'Alice, dear, get some dinner, will you? And Oswald, while you dine, excuse me if I leave you for a while.

And up the lad has to get, and my lord trudges alongside of him with his hands in his pockets, and his cap on the back of his head, a-whistling and talking as easy as you please! And when we come to the cottage, an' the boy's mother come out all in a taking to see what's up, he whips off his cap an' ses he, 'I've brought your son home, ma'am,' ses he, 'because his leg hurt him, and I don't think that stick is enough for him to lean on; and I'm going to ask my grandfather to have a pair of crutches made for him.' An' I'm blessed if the woman wasn't struck all of a heap, as well she might be! I thought I should 'a' hex-plodid, myself!' When the Earl heard the story he was not angry, as Wilkins had been half afraid that he would be; on the contrary, he laughed outright, and called Fauntleroy up to him, and made him tell all about the matter from beginning to end, and then he laughed again. And actually, a few days later, the Dorincourt carriage stopped in the green lane before the cottage where the lame boy lived, and Fauntleroy jumped out and walked up to the door, carrying a pair of strong, light, new crutches shouldered like a gun, and presented them to Mrs. Hartle (the lame boy's name was Hartle) with these words: 'My grandfather's compliments, and if you please, these are for your boy, and we hope he will get better.' 'I said your compliments,' he explained to the Earl when he returned to the carriage. 'You didn't tell me to, but I thought perhaps you forgot. That was right, wasn't it?' And the Earl laughed again, and did not say it was not. In fact, the two were becoming more intimate every day, and every day Fauntleroy's faith in his lordship's benevolence and virtue increased. He had no doubt whatever that his grandfather was the most amiable and generous of elderly gentlemen. Certainly, he himself found his wishes gratified almost before they were uttered; and such gifts and pleasures were lavished upon him, that he was sometimes almost bewildered by his own possessions. Apparently, he was to have everything he wanted, and to do everything he wished to do. And though this would certainly not have been a very wise plan to pursue with all small boys, his young lordship bore it amazingly well. Perhaps, notwithstanding his sweet nature, he might have been somewhat spoiled by it, if it had not been for the hours he spent with his mother at Court Lodge. That 'best friend' of his watched over him ever closely and tenderly.\"\n  choice: \"If I meet a nor-wester, why then I'll make a signal of distress, and some one will tow me in, I guess.' 'Well,' replied O'Brien, 'but step down into the cabin, and take something, captain.' 'With particular pleasure,' replied this strange mortal; and down they went. In about half-an-hour, they returned on deck, and the boat took the American on board. Soon afterwards, O'Brien desired Osbaldistone and myself to step down into the cabin. The chart of the harbour of St. Pierre's lay on the table, and O'Brien said, 'I have had a long conversation with the American, and he states that the privateer is at anchor in this spot' (pointing to a pencil-mark on the chart). 'If so, she is well out; and I see no difficulty in capturing her. You see that she lies in four fathoms water, and so close under the outer battery, that the guns could not be pointed down upon the boats.

That's because of the Declaration of Independence, you know, and the Fourth of July. You see, he was a very brave man.' 'The first Earl of Dorincourt,' said Mr. Havisham solemnly, 'was created an earl four hundred years ago.' 'Well, well!' said Ceddie. 'That was a long time ago! Did you tell Dearest that? It would int'rust her very much.\""

And a doe leaped up, and a doe leaped up From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup. This I, scouting alone, beheld, Once, twice and again! As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled Once, twice and again! And a wolf stole back, and a wolf stole back To carry the word to the waiting pack, And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track Once, twice and again! As the dawn was breaking the Wolf Pack yelled Once, twice and again! Feet in the jungle that leave no mark! Eyes that can see in the dark--the dark! Tongue--give tongue to it! Hark! O hark! Once, twice and again! Kaa's Hunting His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the Buffalo's pride. Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide. If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed Sambhur can gore; Ye need not stop work to inform us: we knew it ten seasons before. Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister and Brother, For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is their mother. 'There is none like to me!' says the Cub in the pride of his earliest kill; But the jungle is large and the Cub he is small. Let him think and be still. Maxims of Baloo All that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned out of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle. The big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat the Hunting Verse--'Feet that make no noise; eyes that can see in the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena whom we hate.' But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head against a tree while Mowgli recited the day's lesson to Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could swim, and swim almost as well as he could run.\"\n  choice: \"There are said to be two at Simla, not counting the woman who blows the bellows at Syree dak-bungalow on the Old Road; Mussoorie has a house haunted of a very lively Thing; a White Lady is supposed to do night-watchman round a house in Lahore; Dalhousie says that one of her houses 'repeats' on autumn evenings all the incidents of a horrible horse-and-precipice accident; Murree has a merry ghost, and, now that she has been swept by cholera, will have room for a sorrowful one; there are Officers' Quarters in Mian Mir whose doors open without reason, and whose furniture is guaranteed to creak, not with the heat of June but with the weight of Invisibles who come to lounge in the chairs; Peshawur possesses houses that none will willingly rent; and there is something--not fever--wrong with a big bungalow in Allahabad.

The shout was unanimous and hearty. 'Are you--are you--well, afraid of these thirty thousand knights?' That joke brought out a good laugh, the boys' troubles vanished away, and they went gaily to their posts. Ah, they were a darling fifty-two! As pretty as girls, too. I was ready for the enemy now. Let the approaching big day come along--it would find us on deck. The big day arrived on time. At dawn the sentry on watch in the corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under the horizon, and a faint sound which he thought to be military music. Breakfast was just ready; we sat down and ate it. This over, I made the boys a little speech, and then sent out a detail to man the battery, with Clarence in command of it. The sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over the land, and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us, with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea. Nearer and nearer it came, and more and more sublimely imposing became its aspect; yes, all England was there, apparently. Soon we could see the innumerable banners fluttering, and then the sun struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash. Yes, it was a fine sight; I hadn't ever seen anything to beat it. At last we could make out details. All the front ranks, no telling how many acres deep, were horsemen--plumed knights in armor. Suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets; the slow walk burst into a gallop, and then--well, it was wonderful to see! Down swept that vast horse-shoe wave--it approached the sand-belt--my breath stood still; nearer, nearer--the strip of green turf beyond the yellow belt grew narrow--narrower still--became a mere ribbon in front of the horses--then disappeared under their hoofs. Great Scott! Why, the whole front of that host shot into the sky with a thunder-crash, and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments; and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was left of the multitude from our sight. Time for the second step in the plan of campaign! I touched a button, and shook the bones of England loose from her spine! In that explosion all our noble civilization-factories went up in the air and disappeared from the earth. It was a pity, but it was necessary. We could not afford to let the enemy turn our own weapons against us. Now ensued one of the dullest quarter-hours I had ever endured. We waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire, and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these. We couldn't see over the wall of smoke, and we couldn't see through it.\"\n  choice: \"Many a time Sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep.

Blushing scarlet, he knew not why, he seized his paddle, and tried to back out of the but somehow, his very efforts to escape those sparkling eyes diverted his attention from everything else: the hippopotamus had caught sight of him, and furious with pain, rushed straight at the unoffending canoe; the harpoon line became entangled round his body, and in a moment he and his frail bark were overturned, and the monster, with his huge white tusks gaping wide, close on him as he struggled in the stream. Luckily Philammon, contrary to the wont of monks, was a bather, and swam like a water-fowl: fear he had never known: death from childhood had been to him, as to the other inmates of the Laura, a contemplation too perpetual to have any paralysing terror in it, even then, when life seemed just about to open on him anew. But the monk was a man, and a young one, and had no intention of dying tamely or unavenged. In an instant he had freed himself from the line; drawn the short knife which was his only weapon; and diving suddenly, avoided the monster's rush, and attacked him from behind with stabs, which, though not deep, still dyed the waters with gore at every stroke. The barbarians shouted with delight. The hippopotamus turned furiously against his new assailant, crushing, alas! the empty canoe to fragments with a single snap of his enormous jaws; but the turn was fatal to him; the barge was close upon him, and as he presented his broad side to the blow, the sinewy arm of the giant drove a harpoon through his heart, and with one convulsive shudder the huge blue mass turned over on its side and floated dead. Poor Philammon! He alone was silent, amid the yells of triumph; sorrowfully he swam round and round his little paper it would not have floated a mouse. Wistfully be eyed the distant banks, half minded to strike out for them and and thought of the and paddled round and thought of the basilisk he might escape the crocodiles, but who could escape and he struck out valiantly for when he was brought to a sudden stop by finding the stem of the barge close on him, a noose thrown over him by some friendly barbarian, and himself hauled on board, amid the laughter, praise, astonishment, and grumbling of the good-natured crew, who had expected him, as a matter of course, to avail himself at once of their help, and could not conceive the cause of his reluctance. Philammon gazed with wonder on his strange hosts, their pale complexions, globular heads and faces, high cheek-bones, tall and sturdy figures; their red beards, and yellow hair knotted fantastically above the head; their awkward dresses, half Roman or Egyptian, and half of foreign fur, soiled and stained in many a storm and fight, but tastelessly bedizened with classic jewels, brooches, and Roman coins, strung like necklaces.\"\n  choice: \"He burned half his beard, and slung a sheepskin over his shoulder, and shaved his head into patterns.

John had again hired the cutter-yacht _Palestine_, and the whole party made several expeditions in her. Constance was entirely devoted to her lover; her life seemed wrapped up in his; she appeared to have no existence except in his presence. I can scarcely enumerate the reasons which prompted such thoughts, but during these months I sometimes found myself wondering if John still returned her affection as ardently as I knew had once been the case. I can certainly call to mind no single circumstance which could justify me in such a suspicion. He performed punctiliously all those thousand little acts of devotion which are expected of an accepted lover; he seemed to take pleasure in perfecting any scheme of enjoyment to amuse her; and yet the impression grew in my mind that he no longer felt the same heart-whole love to her that she bore him, and that he had himself shown six months earlier. I cannot say, my dear Edward, how lively was the grief that even the suspicion of such a fact caused me, and I continually rebuked myself for entertaining for a moment a thought so unworthy, and dismissed it from my mind with reprobation. Alas! ere long it was sure again to make itself felt. We had all seen the Stradivarius violin; indeed it was impossible for my brother longer to conceal it from us, as he now played continually on it. He did not recount to us the story of its discovery, contenting himself with saying that he had become possessed of it at Oxford. We imagined naturally that he had purchased it; and for this I was sorry, as I feared Mr. Thoresby, his guardian, who had given him some years previously an excellent violin by Pressenda, might feel hurt at seeing his present so unceremoniously laid aside. None of us were at all intimately acquainted with the fancies of fiddle-collectors, and were consequently quite ignorant of the enormous value that fashion attached to so splendid an instrument. Even had we known, I do not think that we should have been surprised at John purchasing it; for he had recently come of age, and was in possession of so large a fortune as would amply justify him in such an indulgence had he wished to gratify it. No one, however, could remain unaware of the wonderful musical qualities of the instrument. Its rich and melodious tones would commend themselves even to the most unmusical ear, and formed a subject of constant remark. I noticed also that my brother's knowledge of the violin had improved in a very perceptible manner, for it was impossible to attribute the great beauty and power of his present performance entirely to the excellence of the instrument he was using.\"\n  choice: \"Suddenly he came to a dead stop. He was standing in front of a large mirror. For the first time since he was seventeen he had seen his face without whiskers. His eyes still fixed on his reflection, he beckoned the Chancellor to approach. 'Come here,' he said, clutching him by the arm. 'You see that?' He pointed to the reflection. 'That is what I look like? The mirror hasn't made a mistake of any kind? That is really and truly what I look like?' 'Yes, sire.' For a little while the King continued to gaze fascinated at his reflection, and then he turned on the Chancellor. 'You coward!' he said. 'You weak-kneed, jelly-souled, paper-livered imitation of a man! You cringe to a King who looks like that! Why, you ought to _kick_ me.' The Chancellor remembered that he had one kick owing to him. He drew back his foot, and then a thought occurred to him. 'You might kick me back,' he pointed out. 'I certainly should,' said the King. The Chancellor hesitated a moment. 'I think,' he said, 'that these private quarrels in the face of the common enemy are to be deplored.' The King looked at him, gave a short laugh, and went on walking up and down. 'That face again,' he sighed as he came opposite the mirror. 'No, it's no good; I can never be King like this. I shall abdicate.' 'But, your Majesty, this is a very terrible decision. Could not your Majesty live in retirement until your Majesty had grown your Majesty's whiskers again? Surely this The King came to a stand opposite him and looked down on him gravely. 'Chancellor,' he said, 'those whiskers which you have just seen fluttering in the breeze have been for more than forty years my curse. For more than forty years I have had to live up to those whiskers, behaving, not as my temperament, which is a kindly, indeed a genial one, bade me to behave, but as those whiskers insisted I should behave. Arrogant, hasty-tempered, over-bearing--these are the qualities which have been demanded of the owner of those whiskers. I played a part which was difficult at first; of late, it has, alas! been more easy. Yet it has never been my true nature that you have seen.' He paused and looked silently at himself in the glass. 'But, your Majesty,' said the Chancellor eagerly, 'why choose this moment to abdicate? Think how your country will welcome this new King whom you have just revealed to me. And yet,' he added regretfully, 'it would not be quite the same.' The King turned round to him. 'There spoke a true Barodian,' he said. 'It would not be the same. Barodians have come to expect certain qualities from their rulers, and they would be lost without them.

As the reports of the doctors became gradually more favourable, and our minds were in consequence more free to turn to other subjects, I spoke to Mrs. Temple one day about the picture, saying that it interested me, and asking for some particulars as to the life of Adrian Temple. 'My dear child,' she said, 'I had rather that you should not exhibit any curiosity as to this man, whom I wish that we had not to call an ancestor. I know little of him myself, and indeed his life was of such a nature as no woman, much less a young girl, would desire to be well acquainted with. He was, I believe, a man of remarkable talent, and spent most of his time between Oxford and Italy, though he visited Royston occasionally, and built the large hall here, which we use as a dancing-room.\""

'Let us get together this afternoon, such as may, in the Brutus Tower, for I, as I did say, will no longer suffer these vile bachelors.' Gascoyne and Wilkes exchanged looks, and then the former blew a long whistle. So that afternoon a gloomy set of young faces were gathered together in the Eyry--fifteen of the Knights of the Rose--and all knew why they were assembled. The talk which followed was conducted mostly by Myles. He addressed the others with a straightforward vim and earnestness, but the response was only half-hearted, and when at last, having heated himself up with his own fire, he sat down, puffing out his red cheeks and glaring round, a space of silence followed, the lads looked doubtfully at one another. Myles felt the chill of their silence strike coldly on his enthusiasm, and it vexed him. 'What wouldst thou do, Falworth?' said one of the knights, at last. 'Wouldst have us open a quarrel with the bachelors?' 'Nay,' said Myles, gruffly. 'I had thought that ye would all lend me a hand in a pitched battle but now I see that ye ha' no stomach for that. Ne'theless, I tell ye plainly I will not submit longer to the bachelors. So now I will ask ye not to take any venture upon yourselves, but only this: that ye will stand by me when I do my fighting, and not let five or seven of them fall upon me at once. 'There is Walter Blunt; he is parlous strong,' said one of the others, after a time of silence. 'Methinks he could conquer any two of us.' 'Nay,' said Myles; 'ye do fear him too greatly. I tell ye I fear not to stand up to try battle with him and will do so, too, if the need arise. Only say ye that ye will stand by my back.' 'Marry,' said Gascoyne, quaintly, 'an thou wilt dare take the heavy end upon thee, I for one am willing to stand by and see that thou have thy fill of fighting.' 'I too will stand thee by, Myles,' said Edmund Wilkes. 'And I, and I, and I,' said others, chiming in. Those who would still have held back were carried along by the stream, and so it was settled that if the need should arise for Myles to do a bit of fighting, the others should stand by to see that he had fair play. 'When thinkest thou that thou wilt take thy stand against them, Myles?' asked Wilkes. Myles hesitated a moment. 'To-morrow,' said he, grimly. Several of the lads whistled softly. Gascoyne was prepared for an early opening of the war, but perhaps not for such an early opening as this. 'By 'r Lady, Myles, thou art hungry for brawling,' said he.\"\n  choice: \"Right courteously have ye used me, showing therein that ye have much respect for our glorious King and his deputy in brave Nottinghamshire.

Then Robin Hood and all his merry men arose also, and Robin said to the Sheriff, 'If thou must go, worshipful sir, go thou must; but thou hast forgotten one thing.' 'Nay, I forgot nought,' said the Sheriff; yet all the same his heart sank within him. 'But I say thou hast forgot something,' quoth Robin. 'We keep a merry inn here in the greenwood, but whoever becometh our guest must pay his reckoning.' Then the Sheriff laughed, but the laugh was hollow.

We would not doubt our Sheriff, but he might not like it if he should find he had not paid his full score.' Then Little John counted the money and found that the bag held three hundred pounds in silver and gold.

Hypatia answered with a forced smile. 'Raphael Aben-Ezra has deserted the method of the severe dialectician for that of the eloquent lover.' 'Not altogether,' said he, smiling in return.

After his prayer they put the noose around the young girl's neck, and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear, because she was devouring the baby all the time, wildly kissing it, and snatching it to her face and her breast, and drenching it with tears, and half moaning, half shrieking all the while, and the baby crowing, and laughing, and kicking its feet with delight over what it took for romp and play. Even the hangman couldn't stand it, but turned away. When all was ready the priest gently pulled and tugged and forced the child out of the mother's arms, and stepped quickly out of her reach; but she clasped her hands, and made a wild spring toward him, with a shriek; but the rope--and the under-sheriff--held her short. Then she went on her knees and stretched out her hands and cried: 'One more kiss--oh, my God, one more, one more,--it is the dying that begs it!' She got it; she almost smothered the little thing. And when they got it away again, she cried out: 'Oh, my child, my darling, it will die! It has no home, it has no father, no friend, no mother--' 'It has them all!' said that good priest. 'All these will I be to it till I die.' You should have seen her face then! Gratitude? Lord, what do you want with words to express that? Words are only painted fire; a look is the fire itself. She gave that look, and carried it away to the treasury of heaven, where all things that are divine belong. CHAPTER AN ENCOUNTER IN THE DARK London--to a slave--was a sufficiently interesting place. It was merely a great big village; and mainly mud and thatch. The streets were muddy, crooked, unpaved. The populace was an ever flocking and drifting swarm of rags, and splendors, of nodding plumes and shining armor. The king had a palace there; he saw the outside of it. It made him sigh; yes, and swear a little, in a poor juvenile sixth century way. We saw knights and grandees whom we knew, but they didn't know us in our rags and dirt and raw welts and bruises, and wouldn't have recognized us if we had hailed them, nor stopped to answer, either, it being unlawful to speak with slaves on a chain. Sandy passed within ten yards of me on a mule--hunting for me, I imagined. But the thing which clean broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old barrack in a square, while we were enduring the spectacle of a man being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies.\"\n  choice: \"I have been very fortunate this year--you would be astonished to know how I have thriven. I tell you the honest truth when I say I could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never care _that_ for the expense!' and I snapped my fingers. I could see myself rise a foot at a time in Marco's estimation, and when I fetched out those last words I was become a very tower for style and altitude. 'So you see, you must let me have my way. You can't contribute a cent to this orgy, that's _settled_.' 'It's grand and good of you--' 'No, it isn't. You've opened your house to Jones and me in the most generous way; Jones was remarking upon it to-day, just before you came back from the village; for although he wouldn't be likely to say such a thing to you--because Jones isn't a talker, and is diffident in society--he has a good heart and a grateful, and knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated; yes, you and your wife have been very hospitable toward us--' 'Ah, brother, 'tis nothing--_such_ hospitality!' 'But it _is_ something; the best a man has, freely given, is always something, and is as good as a prince can do, and ranks right along beside it--for even a prince can but do his best.

Why, do you know, sometimes in a single week I spend --but never mind about that--you'd never believe it anyway.' And so we went gadding along, dropping in here and there, pricing things, and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot, and now and then running across pathetic reminders of it, in the persons of shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged. The raiment of Marco and his wife was of coarse tow-linen and linsey-woolsey respectively, and resembled township maps, it being made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added, township by township, in the course of five or six years, until hardly a hand's-breadth of the original garments was surviving and present. Now I wanted to fit these people out with new suits, on account of that swell company, and I didn't know just how to get at it --with delicacy, until at last it struck me that as I had already been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king, it would be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial sort; so I said: 'And Marco, there's another thing which you must permit--out of kindness for Jones--because you wouldn't want to offend him.\"\n  choice: \"He is only a child yet, but I think he may be trusted.'

'Dearest said you wanted me,' he said to Mr. Havisham. 'I've been talking to Bridget.' Mr. Havisham looked down at him a moment. He felt a little awkward and undecided. As Cedric's mother had said, he was a very little boy. 'The Earl of he began, and then he glanced involuntarily at Mrs. Errol. Little Lord Fauntleroy's mother suddenly kneeled down by him and put both her tender arms around his childish body. 'Ceddie,' she said, 'the Earl is your grandpapa, your own papa's father. He is very, very kind, and he loves you and wishes you to love him, because the sons who were his little boys are dead. He wishes you to be happy and to make other people happy. He is very rich, and he wishes you to have everything you would like to have. He told Mr. Havisham so, and gave him a great deal of money for you. You can give some to Bridget now; enough to pay her rent and buy Michael everything. Isn't that fine, Ceddie? Isn't he good?' And she kissed the child on his round cheek, where the bright color suddenly flashed up in his excited amazement. He looked from his mother to Mr. Havisham. 'Can I have it now?' he cried. 'Can I give it to her this minute? She's just going.' Mr. Havisham handed him the money. It was in fresh, clean greenbacks and made a neat roll. Ceddie flew out of the room with it. 'Bridget!' they heard him shout, as he tore into the kitchen. 'Bridget, wait a minute! Here's some money. It's for you, and you can pay the rent. My grandpapa gave it to me. It's for you and Michael!' 'Oh, Master Ceddie!' cried Bridget, in an awe-stricken voice. 'It's twinty-foive dollars is here. Where be's the misthress?' 'I think I shall have to go and explain it to her,' Mrs. Errol said. So she, too, went out of the room and Mr. Havisham was left alone for a while.

He is very, very kind, and he loves you and wishes you to love him, because the sons who were his little boys are dead. He wishes you to be happy and to make other people happy. He is very rich, and he wishes you to have everything you would like to have. He told Mr. Havisham so, and gave him a great deal of money for you. You can give some to Bridget now; enough to pay her rent and buy Michael everything. Isn't that fine, Ceddie? Isn't he good?' And she kissed the child on his round cheek, where the bright color suddenly flashed up in his excited amazement. He looked from his mother to Mr. Havisham. 'Can I have it now?' he cried. 'Can I give it to her this minute? She's just going.' Mr. Havisham handed him the money. It was in fresh, clean greenbacks and made a neat roll. Ceddie flew out of the room with it. 'Bridget!' they heard him shout, as he tore into the kitchen. 'Bridget, wait a minute! Here's some money. It's for you, and you can pay the rent. My grandpapa gave it to me. It's for you and Michael!' 'Oh, Master Ceddie!' cried Bridget, in an awe-stricken voice. 'It's twinty-foive dollars is here. Where be's the misthress?' 'I think I shall have to go and explain it to her,' Mrs. Errol said. So she, too, went out of the room and Mr. Havisham was left alone for a while. He went to the window and stood looking out into the street reflectively.\""

I knew his story well, and so I knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he bade me farewell. He supposed I was having a bitter hard time of it. Sandy and I discussed his story, as we rode along, and she said that La Cote's bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that trip; for the king's fool had overthrown him on the first day, and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the conqueror, but Maledisant didn't do it; and also persisted afterward in sticking to him, after all his defeats. But, said I, suppose the victor should decline to accept his spoil? She said that that wouldn't answer--he must. He couldn't decline; it wouldn't be regular. I made a note of that. If Sandy's music got to be too burdensome, some time, I would let a knight defeat me, on the chance that she would desert to him. In due time we were challenged by the warders, from the castle walls, and after a parley admitted. I have nothing pleasant to tell about that visit. But it was not a disappointment, for I knew Mrs. le Fay by reputation, and was not expecting anything pleasant. She was held in awe by the whole realm, for she had made everybody believe she was a great sorceress. All her ways were wicked, all her instincts devilish. She was loaded to the eyelids with cold malice. All her history was black with crime; and among her crimes murder was common. I was most curious to see her; as curious as I could have been to see Satan. To my surprise she was beautiful; black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive, age had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness. She could have passed for old Uriens' granddaughter, she could have been mistaken for sister to her own son. As soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered into her presence. King Uriens was there, a kind-faced old man with a subdued look; and also the son, Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, in whom I was, of course, interested on account of the tradition that he had once done battle with thirty knights, and also on account of his trip with Sir Gawaine and Sir Marhaus, which Sandy had been aging me with. But Morgan was the main attraction, the conspicuous personality here; she was head chief of this household, that was plain.\"\n  choice: \"So I shall only be taking the exercise I need, and coming for you will give me an object which will insure my taking the exercise I require. You see, therefore, that it is a selfish arrangement on my part.' 'I see that you are very kind,' said Helen, gratefully. 'I wish there were any way in which I could repay you.' 'I have a young sister at home, about your age. If she were situated as you are, I should want somebody to be kind to her. Let me look upon you as my sister.' 'I shall be very glad to have you,' said Helen, her confidence completely won. 'Then, of course, I shall not call you Miss Ford any longer.' 'Why not?' 'Because that would be too formal between brother and sister. I must call you Helen.' 'Yes, if you like,' said the child, more and more pleased. 'It is very pleasant to have a brother.' 'Then you will call me Herbert?' 'Is that your name?' 'Yes. Will you call me so?' 'Perhaps so, by and by. I must get used to it, you know.' 'I think that will soon come, for we shall be a good deal together now.' Helen felt quite relieved by this new arrangement. The next evening Mr. Coleman presented himself promptly at the theatre, thereby disappointing Albert Grover, who was in waiting to repeat his annoyance of the previous evening. 'You may as well give it up,' said Helen's escort, with a significant glance at the young man. 'Henceforth, this young lady will have an escort able and willing to chastise all who are disposed to offer her annoyance.' Helen clung to his arm with a feeling of unspeakable relief. 'Don't tremble, Helen,' said he, kindly. 'You are safe with me.' 'You are very kind to me,' said Helen. 'That is my duty. You have promised to be my little sister, you know.' 'Have you begun a new picture yet?' 'Not yet. I thought I could see where I might make some alterations for the better in the picture you have seen. I shall try to get it admitted to the Academy by and by, unless I succeed first in obtaining a purchaser.' 'It is so beautiful, I should think it would be easy to find a purchaser.' 'If all looked at it with your partial eyes, Helen. But I have no reputation, and an established name goes a great ways.' 'But you will become famous some day.' 'I hope so, but it will be many years first. I must work for bread and butter before I work for fame.' 'Can't you work for both at the same time?' 'I hope so. But sometimes an artist, under the spur of necessity, is compelled to deny his highest aspirations, and work for present profit. From that temptation I am relieved at present,' the young man added, laughing, 'since my pencil is not yet in demand.' They had now reached the door of the lodging-house, and stumbled up the dark staircase to their rooms.\"\n  choice: \"'_What_ king, good sir?' 'What king, indeed! (God-a-mercy, what aileth the boy?)

Yea, and a dear and gracious little urchin is he, too; and whether he be mad or no--and they say he mendeth daily--his praises are on all men's lips; and all bless him, likewise, and offer prayers that he may be spared to reign long in England; for he began humanely with saving the old Duke of Norfolk's life, and now is he bent on destroying the cruellest of the laws that harry and oppress the people.' This news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged him into so deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old man's gossip. He wondered if the 'little urchin' was the beggar-boy whom he left dressed in his own garments in the palace. It did not seem possible that this could be, for surely his manners and speech would betray him if he pretended to be the Prince of Wales--then he would be driven out, and search made for the true prince. Could it be that the Court had set up some sprig of the nobility in his place? No, for his uncle would not allow that--he was all-powerful and could and would crush such a movement, of course. The boy's musings profited him nothing; the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he became, the more his head ached, and the worse he slept. His impatience to get to London grew hourly, and his captivity became almost unendurable. Hendon's arts all failed with the King--he could not be comforted; but a couple of women who were chained near him succeeded better. Under their gentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of patience. He was very grateful, and came to love them dearly and to delight in the sweet and soothing influence of their presence. He asked them why they were in prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he smiled, and inquired-- 'Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison? Now I grieve, for I shall lose ye--they will not keep ye long for such a little thing.' They did not answer; and something in their faces made him uneasy. He said, eagerly-- 'You do not speak; be good to me, and tell me--there will be no other punishment? Prithee tell me there is no fear of that.' They tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and he pursued it-- 'Will they scourge thee? No, no, they would not be so cruel! Say they would not. Come, they _will_ not, will they?' The women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no avoiding an answer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with emotion-- 'Oh, thou'lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit!--God will help us to bear our--' 'It is a confession!' the King broke in.\"\nA:",

Though he appeared to acquiesce in your father's desire, and made him believe that he had complied with his request, he never did so.' 'And is my father still sick?' 'He is, and his greatest desire is to see you before he dies.' Robert Ford rose hastily, and, going to the table, took his hat. 'What would you do, sir?' 'I must go and see my father. Did you not say he wished it?' 'Stay,' said Mr. Sharp; 'whatever is to be done must be done cautiously, or your cousin's suspicions will be aroused, and your purpose frustrated. I will arrange matters, if you will authorize me.' 'Surely; but let not the delay be too long. Perhaps my father will die before I can see him.' 'I will take care to expedite matters.' 'I leave all in your hands; but tell me at least where you have obtained the information you have communicated.' 'From your cousin himself.' 'Did he confess it, then?' asked Mr. Ford, surprised. 'He consulted me professionally. But, sir,' continued Mr. Sharp, in a tone of lofty consciousness, 'as soon as I became aware of the iniquity in which he desired my assistance, I at once determined to do all that might be in my power to defeat his nefarious designs.' Nothing could exceed the moral dignity with which Mr. Sharp uttered these words. 'I will not tell you,' he continued, with commendable self-denial, 'how many thousands your cousin offered, if I would assist him. But for the hope of aiding in his discomfiture, I should have rejected his offers with indignation. Money is no temptation to me where right is concerned. But to the point. In the present case, I temporized. Your cousin even now thinks I am devoted to his interests, and it is best that he should not be undeceived.' 'Do you know where my father lives?' inquired Robert, anxiously. 'It is in Fifth Avenue. After dinner I will give you the direction so that you cannot miss it. You must be cautious in your approach, and when the door is opened, proceed at once to your father's room. It is very probable that the servant will oppose your progress, but if you yield, Lewis will take good care that you never have another opportunity. May I request on the score of prudence, that you will not compromise me, or drop the slightest intimation that I have had any agency in sending you thither?' 'My dear friend,' said Robert Ford, fervently, 'you may rest assured that I will respect your wishes, of whose wisdom I entertain not a doubt.' He shook hands with Mr. Sharp, cordially. The lawyer, with an appearance of profound emotion, put his handkerchief to his eyes, and returned the pressure. At this moment Helen entered, followed by a waiter from a restaurant, from which, on this day of rejoicing, she had been extravagant enough to order a dinner.\"\n  choice: \"Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and I sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.' 'Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I congratulate you. May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon paradise' that five o'clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?' Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end. He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner, and said to 'Now, I've offended him. Well, if it does him good, I'm glad, if it makes him hate me, I'm sorry, but it's true, and I can't take back a word of it.' They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming spirits. But both felt ill at ease. The friendly frankness was disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each. 'Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?' asked Amy, as they parted at her aunt's door. 'Unfortunately I have an engagement. Au revoir, madamoiselle,' and Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became him better than many men. Something in his face made Amy say quickly and 'No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental salutations in France.' 'Goodbye, dear,' and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked, Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness. Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end. My Dear Mentor, Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself, for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser. Tell him so, with my congratulations. Yours gratefully, Telemachus 'Good boy! I'm glad he's gone,' said Amy, with an approving smile. The next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding, with an involuntary sigh, 'Yes, I am glad, but how I shall miss him.'

'When you were here, a few minutes since, I thought I had no place for you. I have been informed since that Miss De Forrest, my regular singer, is unexpectedly taken ill, and may not recover for some time.\"",
            "\"Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and I sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.' 'Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I congratulate you. May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon paradise' that five o'clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?' Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end. He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner, and said to 'Now, I've offended him. Well, if it does him good, I'm glad, if it makes him hate me, I'm sorry, but it's true, and I can't take back a word of it.' They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming spirits. But both felt ill at ease. The friendly frankness was disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each. 'Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?' asked Amy, as they parted at her aunt's door. 'Unfortunately I have an engagement. Au revoir, madamoiselle,' and Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became him better than many men. Something in his face made Amy say quickly and 'No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental salutations in France.' 'Goodbye, dear,' and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked, Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness. Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end. My Dear Mentor, Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself, for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser. Tell him so, with my congratulations. Yours gratefully, Telemachus 'Good boy! I'm glad he's gone,' said Amy, with an approving smile. The next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding, with an involuntary sigh, 'Yes, I am glad, but how I shall miss him.' CHAPTER FORTY THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable, and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble.\""

'They sarve their masters, as in duty bound; we sarve the King, 'cause he can't do without us--and he never axes our leave, but helps himself.' Then the purser's steward came out; he was what they call a bit of a lawyer, that is, had received more education than the seamen in general. 'I trust, sir,' said the man in black, 'that you will contribute something.' 'Not I, my hearty; I owe every farthing of my money, and more too, I'm afraid.' 'Still, sir, a small trifle.' 'Why, what an infernal rascal you must be, to ask a man to give away what is not his own property! Did I not tell you that I owed it all? There's an old proverb--Be just before you're generous. Now, it's my opinion, that you are a methodistical, good-for-nothing blackguard; and if any one is such a fool as to give you money, you will keep it for yourself.' When the man found that he could obtain nothing at the door, he went down on the lower deck, and commenced distributing prints of a black man kneeling in chains and saying, 'Am not I your brother?' Some of the men laughed, and swore that they would paste their brother up in the mess to say prayers for the ship's company; but others were very angry, and abused him. At last, one man, who was tipsy, came up to him. 'Do you pretend for to insinivate that this crying black thief is my brother?' 'To be sure I do,' replied the methodist. 'Then take that for your infernal lie,' said the sailor, hitting him in the face right and left, and knocking the man down into the cable tier, from whence he climbed up, and made his escape out of the frigate as soon as he was able. The ship was now in a state of confusion and uproar; there were Jews trying to sell clothes, or to obtain money for clothes which they had sold; bumboat men and bumboat women showing their long bills, and demanding or coaxing for payment; other people from the shore, with hundreds of small debts; and the sailors' wives, sticking close to them, and disputing every bill presented, as an extortion or a robbery. There were such bawling and threatening, laughing and crying--for the women were all to quit the ship before sunset--at one moment a Jew was upset, and all his hamper of clothes tossed into the hold; at another, a sailor was seen hunting everywhere for a Jew who had cheated him--all squabbling or skylarking, and many of them very drunk. It appeared to me that the sailors had rather a difficult point to settle. They had three claimants upon them, the _Jew_ for clothes, the bumboat men for their mess in harbour, and their wives for their support during their absence; and the money which they received was, generally speaking, not more than sufficient to meet one of the demands.\"\n  choice: \"The first time I go to Lymington I will buy a saw--I can afford it now; and I'll make a carpenter's bench for the first thing, and then, with some more tools, I shall get on; and then, Edward, I'll tell you what else I will do.' 'Then, Humphrey,' replied Edward, laughing, 'you must tell me some other time, for it is now very late, and I must go to bed, as I have to rise early. I know you have so many projects in your mind that it would take half the night to listen to them.' 'Well, I believe what you say is true,' replied Humphrey, 'and it will be better to do one thing at a time than to talk about doing a hundred; so we will, as you say, to bed.' At sunrise, Edward and Humphrey were both up; Alice came out when they tapped at her door, as she would not let Edward go without his breakfast. Edith joined them, and they went to prayers. While they were so employed, Pablo came out and listened to what was said. When prayers were over, Humphrey asked Pablo if he knew what they had been doing. 'No, not much; suppose you pray sun to shine.' 'No, Pablo,' said Edith, 'pray to God to make us good.' 'You bad then?' said Pablo; 'me not bad.' 'Yes, Pablo, every body very bad,' said Alice; 'but if we try to be good, God forgives us.' The conversation was then dropped, and as soon as Edward had made his breakfast, he kissed his sisters, and wished Humphrey farewell. Edward threw his gun over his arm, and calling his puppy, which he had named Holdfast, bade Humphrey and his sisters farewell, and set off on his journey across the forest. Holdfast, as well as Humphrey's puppy, which had been named Watch, had grown very fine young animals. The first had been named Holdfast, because it would seize the pigs by the ears and lead them into the sty, and the other because it was so alert at the least noise; but, as Humphrey said, Watch ought to have learned to lead the pigs, it being more in his line of business than Holdfast's, which was to be brought up for hunting in the forest, while Watch was being educated as a house and farmyard dog. Edward had refused to take the pony, as Humphrey required it for the farm-work, and the weather was so fine that he preferred walking; the more so, as it would enable him on his return across the forest to try for some venison, which he could not have done if he had been mounted on Billy's back. Edward walked quick, followed by his dog, which he had taught to keep to heel. He felt happy, as people do who have no cares, from the fine weather--the deep green of the verdure checkered by the flowers in bloom, and the majestic scenery which met his eye on every side.\"\n  choice: \"'And so you think that you are going to have her?' chuckled Miriam to herself, when Philammon went out.

Perhaps not; for as she spoke the last word, she drew from her bosom, where it hung round her neck by a chain, a broken talisman, exactly similar to the one which she coveted so fiercely, and looked at it long and lovingly--kissed it--wept over it--spoke to it--fondled it in her arms as a mother would a child--murmured over it snatches of lullabies; and her grim, withered features grew softer, purer, grander; and rose ennobled, for a moment, to their long-lost might-have-been, to that personal ideal which every soul brings with it into the world, which shines, dim and potential, in the face of every sleeping babe, before it has been scarred, and distorted, and encrusted in the long tragedy of life.\"\nA:",

I am agent of the Excelsior Copper Mining Company, which possesses one of the most productive mines in the world. It's sure to yield fifty per cent. on the investment. Now, all you have to do is to sell out your Erie shares, and invest in our stock, and I'll insure you a fortune in three years. How many shares did you say you had?' 'I didn't say, that I remember,' said Dick. 'Your offer is very kind and obligin', and as soon as I get time I'll see about it.' 'I hope you will,' said the stranger. 'Permit me to give you my card. 'Samuel Snap, No. -- Wall Street.' I shall be most happy to receive a call from you, and exhibit the maps of our mine. I should be glad to have you mention the matter also to your friends. I am confident you could do no greater service than to induce them to embark in our enterprise.' 'Very good,' said Dick. Here the stranger left the table, and walked up to the desk to settle his bill. 'You see what it is to be a man of fortun', Frank,' said Dick, 'and wear good clothes. I wonder what that chap'll say when he sees me blackin' boots to-morrow in the street?' 'Perhaps you earn your money more honorably than he does, after all,' said Frank.

UP BROADWAY TO MADISON SQUARE As the boys pursued their way up Broadway, Dick pointed out the prominent hotels and places of amusement. Frank was particularly struck with the imposing fronts of the St. Nicholas and Metropolitan Hotels, the former of white marble, the latter of a subdued brown hue, but not less elegant in its internal appointments. He was not surprised to be informed that each of these splendid structures cost with the furnishing not far from a million dollars. At Eighth Street Dick turned to the right, and pointed out the Clinton Hall Building now occupied by the Mercantile Library, comprising at that time over fifty thousand volumes. Now not far from one hundred thousand. A little farther on they came to a large building standing by itself just at the opening of Third and Fourth Avenues, and with one side on each. 'What is that building?' asked Frank. 'That's the Cooper Institute,' said Dick; 'built by Mr. Cooper, a particular friend of mine. Me and Peter Cooper used to go to school together.' 'What is there inside?' asked Frank. 'There's a hall for public meetin's and lectures in the basement, and a readin' room and a picture gallery up above,' said Dick.\"\n  choice: \"To make it complete, you only need a houri.'

The hand of God lieth heavy upon him, and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him, and sorrow that I may not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders, and so bring him peace.' He closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent. After a time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around until his glance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor. Instantly his face flushed with wrath-- 'What, thou here yet! By the glory of God, an' thou gettest not about that traitor's business, thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for lack of a head to grace withal!' The trembling Chancellor answered-- 'Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy! I but waited for the Seal.' 'Man, hast lost thy wits? The small Seal which aforetime I was wont to take with me abroad lieth in my treasury. And, since the Great Seal hath flown away, shall not it suffice? Hast lost thy wits? Begone!

CHAPTER IX. The river pageant. At nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was blazing with light. The river itself, as far as the eye could reach citywards, was so thickly covered with watermen's boats and with pleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and gently agitated by the waves, that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of flowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds. The grand terrace of stone steps leading down to the water, spacious enough to mass the army of a German principality upon, was a picture to see, with its ranks of royal halberdiers in polished armour, and its troops of brilliantly costumed servitors flitting up and down, and to and fro, in the hurry of preparation. Presently a command was given, and immediately all living creatures vanished from the steps. Now the air was heavy with the hush of suspense and expectancy. As far as one's vision could carry, he might see the myriads of people in the boats rise up, and shade their eyes from the glare of lanterns and torches, and gaze toward the palace. A file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps. They were richly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved.\"\nA:",

'What do you mean, sir? You are disposed to be impertinent. Can you deny that it was through your agency that my cousin was informed of that which I most desired to conceal from him?' 'And thereby,' said the lawyer, composedly, 'enabled a father and son to meet before Death came in to separate them forever upon the earth.' 'This, then, is the construction which you put upon your conduct,' said Lewis, with a sneer. 'I congratulate you upon your elevated sentiments.' 'Thank you,' said Mr. Sharp, bowing modestly. 'Appreciation is always soothing to the feelings. Praise from such a source makes me proud, indeed.' Lewis was incensed to find the lawyer adopting the tone which he had hitherto arrogated to himself. That a briefless attorney should dare to indulge in sarcasm at his expense was a piece of unparalleled presumption. 'I need not say,' he remarked with a smile of conscious power, 'how much I regret putting to inconvenience a man of such elevated and Christian sentiments as yourself. Yet I am under the necessity of reminding you that you have in your possession some three hundred dollars which I intrusted to you for a particular purpose. That sum I have present occasion for. If you are unable to pay me, I may feel called upon to resort to measures which may be mutually disagreeable.' 'I am glad you mentioned it,' said Mr. Sharp, blandly.\"",
            "\"After a little while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in his tone-- 'Trouble him no more, poor child. The hand of God lieth heavy upon him, and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him, and sorrow that I may not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders, and so bring him peace.' He closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent. After a time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around until his glance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor. Instantly his face flushed with wrath-- 'What, thou here yet! By the glory of God, an' thou gettest not about that traitor's business, thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for lack of a head to grace withal!' The trembling Chancellor answered-- 'Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy! I but waited for the Seal.' 'Man, hast lost thy wits? The small Seal which aforetime I was wont to take with me abroad lieth in my treasury. And, since the Great Seal hath flown away, shall not it suffice? Hast lost thy wits? Begone! And hark ye--come no more till thou do bring his head.' The poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous vicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent to the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing the morrow for the beheading of the premier peer of England, the luckless Duke of Norfolk. CHAPTER IX. The river pageant. At nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was blazing with light. The river itself, as far as the eye could reach citywards, was so thickly covered with watermen's boats and with pleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and gently agitated by the waves, that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of flowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds. The grand terrace of stone steps leading down to the water, spacious enough to mass the army of a German principality upon, was a picture to see, with its ranks of royal halberdiers in polished armour, and its troops of brilliantly costumed servitors flitting up and down, and to and fro, in the hurry of preparation. Presently a command was given, and immediately all living creatures vanished from the steps. Now the air was heavy with the hush of suspense and expectancy. As far as one's vision could carry, he might see the myriads of people in the boats rise up, and shade their eyes from the glare of lanterns and torches, and gaze toward the palace. A file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps. They were richly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved.\""

'It was a bad bill,' said the clerk, his cheek flushing, and his manner nervous. 'It was no such thing. I require you to produce it, and let the matter be decided.' The clerk fumbled in his vest-pocket, and drew out a bad-looking bill. 'This is a bad bill, but it is not the one I gave the boy.' 'It is the one he gave me.' The young man looked doubtful. 'Boy,' he said to Dick, 'is this the bill you gave to be changed?' 'No, it isn't.' 'You lie, you young rascal!' exclaimed the clerk, who began to find himself in a tight place, and could not see the way out. This scene naturally attracted the attention of all in the store, and the proprietor walked up from the lower end, where he had been busy. 'What's all this, Mr. Hatch?' he demanded. 'That boy,' said the clerk, 'came in and asked change for a bad bill. I kept the bill, and told him to clear out. Now he wants it again to pass on somebody else.' 'Show the bill.' The merchant looked at it. 'Yes, that's a bad bill,' he said. 'There is no doubt about that.' 'But it is not the one the boy offered,' said Dick's patron. 'It is one of the same denomination, but on a different bank.' 'Do you remember what bank it was on?' 'It was on the Merchants' Bank of Boston.' 'Are you sure of it?' 'I am.' 'Perhaps the boy kept it and offered the other.' 'You may search me if you want to,' said Dick, indignantly. 'He doesn't look as if he was likely to have any extra bills. I suspect that your clerk pocketed the good bill, and has substituted the counterfeit note. It is a nice little scheme of his for making money.' 'I haven't seen any bill on the Merchants' Bank,' said the clerk, doggedly. 'You had better feel in your pockets.' 'This matter must be investigated,' said the merchant, firmly. 'If you have the bill, produce it.' 'I haven't got it,' said the clerk; but he looked guilty notwithstanding. 'I demand that he be searched,' said Dick's patron. 'I tell you I haven't got it.' 'Shall I send for a police officer, Mr. Hatch, or will you allow yourself to be searched quietly?' said the merchant. Alarmed at the threat implied in these words, the clerk put his hand into his vest-pocket, and drew out a two-dollar bill on the Merchants' Bank. 'Is this your note?' asked the shopkeeper, showing it to the young man. 'It is.' 'I must have made a mistake,' faltered the clerk. 'I shall not give you a chance to make such another mistake in my employ,' said the merchant sternly.\"\n  choice: \"'To think,' he exclaimed, bitterly, 'that this should happen when I am just within reach of success. Twenty-four hours more, and it would probably have been too late!' 'How?' 'I mean that my uncle probably has not twenty-four hours lease of life, unless this meeting revives him. The probability is, that it will have a contrary effect.' 'Do you consider that you have lost all?' 'Fortunately, no. I am in hopes that this interview will, after all, prove of no advantage to my cousin.' 'Ah!' said Mr. Sharp, rubbing his hands with apparent delight, but secret anxiety, beginning for the first time to feel that he would not be recompensed for his treachery. 'Yes. It is not likely that my uncle will be able to make a new will, and the present one I shall be very well contented with.' 'Confusion!' thought the lawyer. 'I wish I could only see the old gentleman, and whisper a few words in his ear.'

May I be so bold as to ask if the gentleman is a relation, sir?' 'Yes,' said Lewis, shortly. 'You say you have heard no sound proceeding from the room for a few minutes?' 'No, sir.' 'Perhaps he is dead,' thought Lewis, hopefully. 'At any rate, I will go up and see.' 'That will do,' he said to the servant, who was still in waiting. 'I am going up into my uncle's room, and if I should want you I will ring.' 'I wonder who the gentleman is,' said the servant, to herself. 'He said Mr. Rand was his father.

While he sat reflecting a moment over the ease with which he was doing strange and glittering miracles, a happy thought shot into his mind: why not make his mother Duchess of Offal Court, and give her an estate? But a sorrowful thought swept it instantly away: he was only a king in name, these grave veterans and great nobles were his masters; to them his mother was only the creature of a diseased mind; they would simply listen to his project with unbelieving ears, then send for the doctor. The dull work went tediously on. Petitions were read, and proclamations, patents, and all manner of wordy, repetitious, and wearisome papers relating to the public business; and at last Tom sighed pathetically and murmured to himself, 'In what have I offended, that the good God should take me away from the fields and the free air and the sunshine, to shut me up here and make me a king and afflict me so?' Then his poor muddled head nodded a while and presently drooped to his shoulder; and the business of the empire came to a standstill for want of that august factor, the ratifying power. Silence ensued around the slumbering child, and the sages of the realm ceased from their deliberations. During the forenoon, Tom had an enjoyable hour, by permission of his keepers, Hertford and St. John, with the Lady Elizabeth and the little Lady Jane Grey; though the spirits of the princesses were rather subdued by the mighty stroke that had fallen upon the royal house; and at the end of the visit his 'elder sister'--afterwards the 'Bloody Mary' of history--chilled him with a solemn interview which had but one merit in his eyes, its brevity. He had a few moments to himself, and then a slim lad of about twelve years of age was admitted to his presence, whose clothing, except his snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists, was of black,--doublet, hose, and all. He bore no badge of mourning but a knot of purple ribbon on his shoulder. He advanced hesitatingly, with head bowed and bare, and dropped upon one knee in front of Tom. Tom sat still and contemplated him soberly a moment. Then he said-- 'Rise, lad. Who art thou. What wouldst have?' The boy rose, and stood at graceful ease, but with an aspect of concern in his face. He said-- 'Of a surety thou must remember me, my lord. I am thy whipping-boy.' 'My _whipping_-boy?' 'The same, your Grace. I am Humphrey--Humphrey Marlow.' Tom perceived that here was someone whom his keepers ought to have posted him about.\"\n  choice: \"CHAPTER VI THERE ARE NO WIZARDS IN BARODIA Meanwhile 'the King of Euralia was prosecuting the war with utmost vigour.' So says Roger in that famous chapter of his, and certainly Merriwig was very busy. On the declaration of war the Euralian forces, in accordance with custom, had marched into Barodia. However hot ran the passion between them, the two Kings always preserved the elementary courtesies of war. The last battle had taken place in Euralian territory; this time, therefore, Barodia was the scene of the conflict. To Barodia, then, King Merriwig had led his army. Suitable pasture land had been allotted them as a camping ground, and amid the cheers of the Barodian populace the Euralians made their simple preparations for the night. The two armies had now been sitting opposite to each other for some weeks, but neither side had been idle. On the very first morning Merriwig had put on his Cloak of Darkness and gone to the enemy's camp to explore the situation. Unfortunately the same idea had occurred at the same moment to the King of Barodia. He also had his Cloak of Darkness. Half way across, to the utmost astonishment of both, the two Kings had come violently into contact. Realising that they had met some unprecedented enchantment, they had hurried home after the recoil to consult their respective Chancellors. The Chancellors could make nothing of it. They could only advise their Majesties to venture another attempt on the following morning. 'But by a different route,' said the Chancellors, 'whereby the Magic Pillar shall be avoided.' So by the more southerly path the two Kings ventured out next morning. Half way across there was another violent collision, and both Kings sat down suddenly to think it out. 'Wonder of wonders,' said Merriwig. 'There is a magic wall stretching between the two armies.' 'He stood up and holding up his hand said impressively: '_Bo, boll, bill, bole._ _Wo, 'Mystery of mysteries!' cried the King of Barodia. 'It He stopped suddenly. Both Kings coughed. They were remembering with some shame their fright of yesterday. 'Who are you?' said the King of Barodia. Merriwig saw that there was need to dissemble. 'His Majesty's swineherd,' he said, in what he imagined might be a swineherd's voice. 'Er--so am I,' said the King of Barodia, rather feebly. There was obviously nothing for it but for them to discuss swine. Merriwig was comfortably ignorant of the subject. The King of Barodia knew rather less than that. 'Er--how many have you?' asked the latter. 'Seven thousand,' said Merriwig at random. 'Er--so have I,' said the King of Barodia, still more feebly. 'Couples,' explained Merriwig. 'Mine are ones,' said the King of Barodia, determined to be independent at last. Each King was surprised to find how easy it was to talk to an expert on his own subject. The King of Barodia, indeed, began to feel reckless.

On their journeys those Britons were used to long fasts, and knew how to bear them; and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting, after the style of the Indian and the anaconda. As like as not, Sandy was loaded for a three-day stretch. We were off before sunrise, Sandy riding and I limping along behind. In half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded as a road. They were as humble as animals to me; and when I proposed to breakfast with them, they were so flattered, so overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that at first they were not able to believe that I was in earnest. My lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side; she said in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the other cattle--a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely because it referred to them, and not because it insulted or offended them, for it didn't. And yet they were not slaves, not chattels. By a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen. Seven-tenths of the free population of the country were of just their class and degree: small 'independent' farmers, artisans, etc.; which is to say, they were the nation, the actual Nation; they were about all of it that was useful, or worth saving, or really respect-worthy, and to subtract them would have been to subtract the Nation and leave behind some dregs, some refuse, in the shape of a king, nobility and gentry, idle, unproductive, acquainted mainly with the arts of wasting and destroying, and of no sort of use or value in any rationally constructed world. And yet, by ingenious contrivance, this gilded minority, instead of being in the tail of the procession where it belonged, was marching head up and banners flying, at the other end of it; had elected itself to be the Nation, and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long that they had come at last to accept it as a truth; and not only that, but to believe it right and as it should be. The priests had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state of things was ordained of God; and so, not reflecting upon how unlike God it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms, and especially such poor transparent ones as this, they had dropped the matter there and become respectfully quiet.\"",
            "\"CHAPTER VI THERE ARE NO WIZARDS IN BARODIA Meanwhile 'the King of Euralia was prosecuting the war with utmost vigour.' So says Roger in that famous chapter of his, and certainly Merriwig was very busy. On the declaration of war the Euralian forces, in accordance with custom, had marched into Barodia. However hot ran the passion between them, the two Kings always preserved the elementary courtesies of war. The last battle had taken place in Euralian territory; this time, therefore, Barodia was the scene of the conflict. To Barodia, then, King Merriwig had led his army. Suitable pasture land had been allotted them as a camping ground, and amid the cheers of the Barodian populace the Euralians made their simple preparations for the night. The two armies had now been sitting opposite to each other for some weeks, but neither side had been idle. On the very first morning Merriwig had put on his Cloak of Darkness and gone to the enemy's camp to explore the situation. Unfortunately the same idea had occurred at the same moment to the King of Barodia. He also had his Cloak of Darkness. Half way across, to the utmost astonishment of both, the two Kings had come violently into contact. Realising that they had met some unprecedented enchantment, they had hurried home after the recoil to consult their respective Chancellors. The Chancellors could make nothing of it. They could only advise their Majesties to venture another attempt on the following morning. 'But by a different route,' said the Chancellors, 'whereby the Magic Pillar shall be avoided.' So by the more southerly path the two Kings ventured out next morning. Half way across there was another violent collision, and both Kings sat down suddenly to think it out. 'Wonder of wonders,' said Merriwig. 'There is a magic wall stretching between the two armies.' 'He stood up and holding up his hand said impressively: '_Bo, boll, bill, bole._ _Wo, 'Mystery of mysteries!' cried the King of Barodia. 'It He stopped suddenly. Both Kings coughed. They were remembering with some shame their fright of yesterday. 'Who are you?' said the King of Barodia. Merriwig saw that there was need to dissemble. 'His Majesty's swineherd,' he said, in what he imagined might be a swineherd's voice. 'Er--so am I,' said the King of Barodia, rather feebly. There was obviously nothing for it but for them to discuss swine. Merriwig was comfortably ignorant of the subject. The King of Barodia knew rather less than that. 'Er--how many have you?' asked the latter. 'Seven thousand,' said Merriwig at random. 'Er--so have I,' said the King of Barodia, still more feebly. 'Couples,' explained Merriwig. 'Mine are ones,' said the King of Barodia, determined to be independent at last. Each King was surprised to find how easy it was to talk to an expert on his own subject. The King of Barodia, indeed, began to feel reckless. 'Well,' he said, 'I must be getting back.\""

One--two--three--four--five--six--seven. _Seven!_ Was it seven? Or was that seventh bit of a twig an accidental bit which had been on the ground anyhow? Surely it was six! Had he said 'six' to Antony? If so, Antony would remember, and it was all right. Six. He threw away the seventh twig and collected the other six together. Perhaps they would be safer in his pocket.

Jean sat down, very pale, and the man described the finding of the poor shattered body. As he finished, Coventry appeared, and with one look of mingled remorse, shame, and sorrow, the elder brother went away, to find and bring the younger home. Jean crept into the garden like a guilty thing, trying to hide the satisfaction which struggled with a woman's natural pity, for so sad an end for this brave young life. 'Why waste tears or feign sorrow when I must be glad?' she muttered, as she paced to and fro along the terrace. 'The poor boy is out of pain, and I am out of danger.' She got no further, for, turning as she spoke, she stood face to face with Edward! Bearing no mark of peril on dress or person, but stalwart and strong as ever, he stood there looking at her, with contempt and compassion struggling in his face. As if turned to stone, she remained motionless, with dilated eyes, arrested breath, and paling cheek. He did not speak but watched her silently till she put out a trembling hand, as if to assure herself by touch that it was really he. Then he drew back, and as if the act convinced as fully as words, she said slowly, 'They told me you were dead.' 'And you were glad to believe it. No, it was my comrade, young Courtney, who unconsciously deceived you all, and lost his life, as I should have done, if I had not gone to Ascot after seeing him off yesterday.' 'To Ascot?' echoed Jean, shrinking back, for Edward's eye was on her, and his voice was stern and cold. 'Yes; you know the place. I went there to make inquiries concerning you and was well satisfied. Why are you still here?' 'The three days are not over yet. I hold you to your promise. Before night I shall be gone; till then you will be silent, if you have honor enough to keep your word.' 'I have.' Edward took out his watch and, as he put it back, said with cool precision, 'It is now two, the train leaves for London at half-past six; a carriage will wait for you at the side door. Allow me to advise you to go then, for the instant dinner is over I shall speak.' And with a bow he went into the house, leaving Jean nearly suffocated with a throng of contending emotions.

Both the young men had submitted themselves to the ordeal, and while neither would of course have admitted as much to anyone else, both felt secretly that they had no reason to be dissatisfied with their performance. The results would not be published for some weeks to come. The last night of the term had arrived, the last night too of John's Oxford career. It was near nine o'clock, but still quite light, and the rich orange glow of sunset had not yet left the sky. The air was warm and sultry, as on that eventful evening when just a year ago he had for the first time seen the figure or the illusion of the figure of Adrian Temple. Since that time he had played the 'Areopagita' many, many times; but there had never been any reappearance of that form, nor even had the once familiar creaking of the wicker chair ever made itself heard. As he sat alone in his room, thinking with a natural melancholy that he had seen the sun set for the last time on his student life, and reflecting on the possibilities of the future and perhaps on opportunities wasted in the past, the memory of that evening last June recurred strongly to his imagination, and he felt an irresistible impulse to play once more the 'Areopagita.' He unlocked the now familiar cupboard and took out the violin, and never had the exquisite gradations of colour in its varnish appeared to greater advantage than in the soft mellow light of the fading day. As he began the _Gagliarda_ he looked at the wicker chair, half expecting to see a form he well knew seated in it; but nothing of the kind ensued, and he concluded the 'Areopagita' without the occurrence of any unusual phenomenon. It was just at its close that he heard some one knocking at the outer door. He hurriedly locked away the violin and opened the 'oak.' It was Mr. Gaskell. He came in rather awkwardly, as though not sure whether he would be welcomed. 'Johnnie,' he began, and stopped. The force of ancient habit sometimes, dear nephew, leads us unwittingly to accost those who were once our friends by a familiar or nick-name long after the intimacy that formerly justified it has vanished. But sometimes we intentionally revert to the use of such a name, not wishing to proclaim openly, as it were, by a more formal address that we are no longer the friends we once were.

Both the young men had submitted themselves to the ordeal, and while neither would of course have admitted as much to anyone else, both felt secretly that they had no reason to be dissatisfied with their performance. The results would not be published for some weeks to come. The last night of the term had arrived, the last night too of John's Oxford career. It was near nine o'clock, but still quite light, and the rich orange glow of sunset had not yet left the sky. The air was warm and sultry, as on that eventful evening when just a year ago he had for the first time seen the figure or the illusion of the figure of Adrian Temple. Since that time he had played the 'Areopagita' many, many times; but there had never been any reappearance of that form, nor even had the once familiar creaking of the wicker chair ever made itself heard. As he sat alone in his room, thinking with a natural melancholy that he had seen the sun set for the last time on his student life, and reflecting on the possibilities of the future and perhaps on opportunities wasted in the past, the memory of that evening last June recurred strongly to his imagination, and he felt an irresistible impulse to play once more the 'Areopagita.' He unlocked the now familiar cupboard and took out the violin, and never had the exquisite gradations of colour in its varnish appeared to greater advantage than in the soft mellow light of the fading day. As he began the _Gagliarda_ he looked at the wicker chair, half expecting to see a form he well knew seated in it; but nothing of the kind ensued, and he concluded the 'Areopagita' without the occurrence of any unusual phenomenon. It was just at its close that he heard some one knocking at the outer door. He hurriedly locked away the violin and opened the 'oak.' It was Mr. Gaskell. He came in rather awkwardly, as though not sure whether he would be welcomed. 'Johnnie,' he began, and stopped. The force of ancient habit sometimes, dear nephew, leads us unwittingly to accost those who were once our friends by a familiar or nick-name long after the intimacy that formerly justified it has vanished. But sometimes we intentionally revert to the use of such a name, not wishing to proclaim openly, as it were, by a more formal address that we are no longer the friends we once were. I think this latter was the case with Mr. Gaskell as he repeated the familiar name.\"",
            "\"Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening, his only leisure time?' 'No, but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend.' 'I think you could, dear, and I think you ought. May I speak quite freely, and will you remember that it's Mother who blames as well as Mother who sympathizes?' 'Indeed I will! Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything.' Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and with a little interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever. 'You have only made the mistake that most young wives make--forgotten your duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways, for children should draw you nearer than ever, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and John had nothing to do but support them. I've seen it for some weeks, but have not spoken, feeling sure it would come right in time.' 'I'm afraid it won't. If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm jealous, and I wouldn't insult him by such an idea. He doesn't see that I want him, and I don't know how to tell him without words.' 'Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away. My dear, he's longing for his little home, but it isn't home without you, and you are always in the nursery.' 'Oughtn't I to be there?' 'Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you are unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something to John as well as to the babies. Don't neglect husband for children, don't shut him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it. His place is there as well as yours, and the children need him. Let him feel that he has a part to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be better for you all.' 'You really think so, Mother?' 'I know it, Meg, for I've tried it, and I seldom give advice unless I've proved its practicability. When you and Jo were little, I went on just as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless I devoted myself wholly to you. Poor Father took to his books, after I had refused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone. I struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me. I nearly spoiled her by indulgence.\""

He was twenty years old and suffered from aspirations. I met him in a public billiard-saloon where the marker called him by his given name, and he called the marker 'Bulls-eyes.' Charley explained, a little nervously, that he had only come to the place to look on, and since looking on at games of skill is not a cheap amusement for the young, I suggested that Charlie should go back to his mother. That was our first step toward better acquaintance. He would call on me sometimes in the evenings instead of running about London with his fellow-clerks; and before long, speaking of himself as a young man must, he told me of his aspirations, which were all literary. He desired to make himself an undying name chiefly through verse, though he was not above sending stories of love and death to the drop-a-penny-in-the-slot journals. It was my fate to sit still while Charlie read me poems of many hundred lines, and bulky fragments of plays that would surely shake the world. My reward was his unreserved confidence, and the self-revelations and troubles of a young man are almost as holy as those of a maiden. Charlie had never fallen in love, but was anxious to do so on the first opportunity; he believed in all things good and all things honorable, but, at the same time, was curiously careful to let me see that he knew his way about the world as befitted a bank clerk on twenty-five shillings a week. He rhymed 'dove' with 'love' and 'moon' with 'June,' and devoutly believed that they had never so been rhymed before. The long lame gaps in his plays he filled up with hasty words of apology and description and swept on, seeing all that he intended to do so clearly that he esteemed it already done, and turned to me for applause. I fancy that his mother did not encourage his aspirations, and I know that his writing-table at home was the edge of his washstand. This he told me almost at the outset of our acquaintance; when he was ravaging my bookshelves, and a little before I was implored to speak the truth as to his chances of 'writing something really great, you know.' Maybe I encouraged him too much, for, one night, he called on me, his eyes flaming with excitement, and said breathlessly: 'Do you mind--can you let me stay here and write all this evening? I won't interrupt you, I won't really. There's no place for me to write in at my mother's.' 'What's the trouble?' I said, knowing well what that trouble was.\"\n  choice: \"He was going to find Sea Cow, if there was such a person in the sea, and he was going to find a quiet island with good firm beaches for seals to live on, where men could not get at them. So he explored and explored by himself from the North to the South Pacific, swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day and a night. He met with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly escaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark, and the Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up and down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet spotted scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow very proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and he never found an island that he could fancy. If the beach was good and hard, with a slope behind it for seals to play on, there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon, boiling down blubber, and Kotick knew what that meant. Or else he could see that seals had once visited the island and been killed off, and Kotick knew that where men had come once they would come again. He picked up with an old stumpy-tailed albatross, who told him that Kerguelen Island was the very place for peace and quiet, and when Kotick went down there he was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked black cliffs in a heavy sleet-storm with lightning and thunder.

Not exactly a beauty, but accomplished and well-bred, which is better for one of her class.' 'Some tea, Sir John?' said a soft voice at his elbow, and there was Miss Muir, offering cups to the gentlemen. 'Thank you, thank you,' said Sir John, sincerely hoping she had overheard him. As Coventry took his, he said graciously, 'You are very forgiving, Miss Muir, to wait upon me, after I have caused you so much pain.'

'What are you doing here, son?' Block asked. 'Scaring rooks for Farmer Topp,' was the answer. 'Have you got a charge of powder to spare?' said Elzevir, showing his pistol. 'I want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper, and have dropped my flask. Maybe you've seen a flask in walking through the furrows?' He whispered to me to lie still, so that it might not be perceived my leg was broken; and the boy replied: 'No, I have seen no flask; but very like have not come the same way as you, being sent out here from Lowermoigne; and as for powder, I have little left, and must save that for the rooks, or shall get a beating for my pains.' 'Come,' said Elzevir, 'give me a charge or two, and there is half a crown for thee.' And he took the coin out of his pocket and showed it. The boy's eyes twinkled, and so would mine at so valuable a piece, and he took out from his pocket a battered cowskin flask. 'Give flask and all,' said Elzevir, 'and thou shalt have a crown,' and he showed him the larger coin. No time was wasted in words; Elzevir had the flask in his pocket, and the boy was biting the crown. 'What shot have you?' said Elzevir. 'What! have you dropped your shot-flask too?' asked the boy. And his voice had something of surprise in it. 'Nay, but my shot are over small; if thou hast a slug or two, I would take them.' 'I have a dozen goose-slugs, No. 2,' said the boy; 'but thou must pay a shilling for them. My master says I never am to use them, except I see a swan or buzzard, or something fit to cook, come over: I shall get a sound beating for my pains, and to be beat is worth a shilling.' 'If thou art beat, be beat for something more,' says Elzevir the tempter. 'Give me that firelock that thou carriest, and take a guinea.' 'Nay, I know not,' says the boy; 'there are queer tales afloat at Lowermoigne, how that a Posse met the Contraband this morning, and shots were fired, and a gauger got an overdose of lead--maybe of goose slugs No. 2. The smugglers got off clear, but they say the hue and cry is up already, and that a head-price will be fixed of twenty pound. So if I sell you a fowling-piece, maybe I shall do wrong, and have the Government upon me as well as my master.' The surprise in his voice was changed to suspicion, for while he spoke I saw that his eye had fallen on my foot, though I tried to keep it in the shadow; and that he saw the boot clotted with blood, and the kerchief tied round my leg.\"\n  choice: \"They have bound him and taken him to Nottingham Town, and ere I left the Blue Boar I heard that he should be hanged tomorrow day.' 'He shall not be hanged tomorrow day,' cried Robin; 'or, if he be, full many a one shall gnaw the sod, and many shall have cause to cry Alack-a-day!' Then he clapped his horn to his lips and blew three blasts right loudly, and presently his good yeomen came running through the greenwood until sevenscore bold blades were gathered around him. 'Now hark you all!' cried Robin. 'Our dear companion Will Stutely hath been taken by that vile Sheriff's men, therefore doth it behoove us to take bow and brand in hand to bring him off again; for I wot that we ought to risk life and limb for him, as he hath risked life and limb for us. Is it not so, my merry men all?' Then all cried, 'Ay!' with a great voice. So the next day they all wended their way from Sherwood Forest, but by different paths, for it behooved them to be very crafty; so the band separated into parties of twos and threes, which were all to meet again in a tangled dell that lay near to Nottingham Town. Then, when they had all gathered together at the place of meeting, Robin spoke to them thus: 'Now we will lie here in ambush until we can get news, for it doth behoove us to be cunning and wary if we would bring our friend Will Stutely off from the Sheriff's clutches.' So they lay hidden a long time, until the sun stood high in the sky. The day was warm and the dusty road was bare of travelers, except an aged palmer who walked slowly along the highroad that led close beside the gray castle wall of Nottingham Town. When Robin saw that no other wayfarer was within sight, he called young David of Doncaster, who was a shrewd man for his years, and said to him, 'Now get thee forth, young David, and speak to yonder palmer that walks beside the town wall, for he hath come but now from Nottingham Town, and may tell thee news of good Stutely, perchance.' So David strode forth, and when he came up to the pilgrim, he saluted him and said, 'Good morrow, holy father, and canst thou tell me when Will Stutely will be hanged upon the gallows tree? I fain would not miss the sight, for I have come from afar to see so sturdy a rogue hanged.' 'Now, out upon thee, young man,' cried the Palmer, 'that thou shouldst speak so when a good stout man is to be hanged for nothing but guarding his own life!'

Then he clapped his horn to his lips and blew three blasts right loudly, and presently his good yeomen came running through the greenwood until sevenscore bold blades were gathered around him. 'Now hark you all!' cried Robin. 'Our dear companion Will Stutely hath been taken by that vile Sheriff's men, therefore doth it behoove us to take bow and brand in hand to bring him off again; for I wot that we ought to risk life and limb for him, as he hath risked life and limb for us. Is it not so, my merry men all?' Then all cried, 'Ay!' with a great voice. So the next day they all wended their way from Sherwood Forest, but by different paths, for it behooved them to be very crafty; so the band separated into parties of twos and threes, which were all to meet again in a tangled dell that lay near to Nottingham Town. Then, when they had all gathered together at the place of meeting, Robin spoke to them thus: 'Now we will lie here in ambush until we can get news, for it doth behoove us to be cunning and wary if we would bring our friend Will Stutely off from the Sheriff's clutches.' So they lay hidden a long time, until the sun stood high in the sky. The day was warm and the dusty road was bare of travelers, except an aged palmer who walked slowly along the highroad that led close beside the gray castle wall of Nottingham Town. When Robin saw that no other wayfarer was within sight, he called young David of Doncaster, who was a shrewd man for his years, and said to him, 'Now get thee forth, young David, and speak to yonder palmer that walks beside the town wall, for he hath come but now from Nottingham Town, and may tell thee news of good Stutely, perchance.' So David strode forth, and when he came up to the pilgrim, he saluted him and said, 'Good morrow, holy father, and canst thou tell me when Will Stutely will be hanged upon the gallows tree? I fain would not miss the sight, for I have come from afar to see so sturdy a rogue hanged.' 'Now, out upon thee, young man,' cried the Palmer, 'that thou shouldst speak so when a good stout man is to be hanged for nothing but guarding his own life!' And he struck his staff upon the ground in anger.\"",
            "\"In the contemplation of its perfection I experienced a curious mental sensation, which I can only compare to the physical oppression produced on some persons by the heavy and cloying perfume of a bouquet of gardenias or other too highly scented exotics. In my brother's room was a medieval reproduction in mellow alabaster of a classic group of a dolphin encircling a Cupid. It was, I think, the fairest work of art I ever saw, but it jarred upon my sense of propriety that close by it should hang an ivory crucifix. I would rather, I think, have seen all things material and pagan entirely, with every view of the future life shut out, than have found a medley of things sacred and profane, where the emblems of our highest hopes and aspirations were placed in insulting indifference side by side with the embodied forms of sensuality. Here, in this scene of magical beauty, it seemed to me for a moment that the years had rolled back, that Christianity had still to fight with a _living_ Paganism, and that the battle was not yet won. It was the same all through the house; and there were many other matters which filled me with regret, mingled with vague and apprehensive surmises which I shall not here repeat. At one end of the house was a small library, but it contained few works except Latin and Greek classics. I had gone thither one day to look for a book that John had asked for, when in turning out some drawers I found a number of letters written from Worth by my lost Constance to her husband. The shock of being brought suddenly face to face with a handwriting that evoked memories at once so dear and sad was in itself a sharp one; but its bitterness was immeasurably increased by the discovery that not one of these envelopes had ever been opened. While that dear heart, now at rest, was pouring forth her love and sorrow to the ears that should have been above all others ready to receive them, her letters, as they arrived, were flung uncared for, unread, even unopened, into any haphazard receptacle. The days passed one by one at the Villa de Angelis with but little incident, nor did my brother's health either visibly improve or decline. Though the weather was still more than usually warm, a grateful breeze came morning and evening from the sea and tempered the heat so much as to render it always supportable. John would sometimes in the evening sit propped up with cushions on the trellised balcony looking towards Baia, and watch the fishermen setting their nets. We could hear the melody of their deep-voiced songs carried up on the night air. 'It was here, Sophy,' my brother said, as we sat one evening looking on a scene like this,--'It was here that the great epicure Pollio built himself a famous house, and called it by two Greek words meaning a 'truce to care,' from which our name of Posilipo is derived.\""

'He didn't appear to be.' Now then, he arrived, you say, about three o'clock?' 'Yes, about that.' 'Who was in the house then?' 'Mark and myself, and some of the servants. I don't know which. Of course, you will ask them directly, no doubt.' 'With your permission. No guests?' 'They were out all day playing golf,' explained Cayley. 'Oh, by the way,' he put in, 'if I may interrupt a moment, will you want to see them at all? It isn't very pleasant for them now, naturally, and I suggested--' he turned to Antony, who nodded back to him. 'I understand that they want to go back to London this evening. There's no objection to that, I suppose?' 'You will let me have their names and addresses in case I want to communicate with them?' 'Of course. One of them is staying on, if you would like to see him later, but they only came back from their golf as we crossed the hall.' 'That's all right, Mr. Cayley. Well, now then, let's go back to three o'clock. Where were you when Robert arrived?' Cayley explained how he had been sitting in the hall, how Audrey had asked him where the master was, and how he had said that he had last seen him going up to the Temple. 'She went away, and I went on with my book. There was a step on the stairs, and I looked up to see Mark coming down. He went into the office, and I went on with my book again. I went into the library for a moment, to refer to another book, and when I was in there I heard a shot. At least, it was a loud bang, I wasn't sure if it was a shot. I stood and listened. Then I came slowly to the door and looked out. Then I went back again, hesitated a bit, you know, and finally decided to go across to the office, and make sure that it was all right. I turned the handle of the door and found it was locked. Then I got frightened, and I banged at the door, and shouted, and--well, that was when Mr. Gillingham arrived.' He went on to explain how they had found the body. The inspector looked at him with a smile. 'Yes, well, we shall have to go over some of that again, Mr. Cayley. Mr. Mark, now.

        "inputs": "Q: Choose the text that has been written by the same author as: \"Swarms of boys seemed to be out of employment, and it was not unusual to find from fifty to a hundred applicants for a single place. There was another difficulty. It was generally desired that the boy wanted should reside with his parents. When Fosdick, on being questioned, revealed the fact of his having no parents, and being a boy of the street, this was generally sufficient of itself to insure a refusal. Merchants were afraid to trust one who had led such a vagabond life. Dick, who was always ready for an emergency, suggested borrowing a white wig, and passing himself off for Fosdick's father or grandfather. But Henry thought this might be rather a difficult character for our hero to sustain. After fifty applications and as many failures, Fosdick began to get discouraged. There seemed to be no way out of his present business, for which he felt unfitted. 'I don't know but I shall have to black boots all my life,' he said, one day, despondently, to Dick. 'Keep a stiff upper lip,' said Dick. 'By the time you get to be a gray-headed veteran, you may get a chance to run errands for some big firm on the Bowery, which is a very cheerin' reflection.' So Dick by his drollery and perpetual good spirits kept up Fosdick's courage. 'As for me,' said Dick, 'I expect by that time to lay up a colossal fortun' out of shines, and live in princely style on the Avenoo.' But one morning, Fosdick, straying into French's Hotel, discovered the following advertisement in the columns of 'The Herald,'-- 'WANTED--A smart, capable boy to run errands, and make himself generally useful in a hat and cap store. Salary three dollars a week at first. Inquire at No. -- Broadway, after ten o'clock, A.M.' He determined to make application, and, as the City Hall clock just then struck the hour indicated, lost no time in proceeding to the store, which was only a few blocks distant from the Astor House. It was easy to find the store, as from a dozen to twenty boys were already assembled in front of it. They surveyed each other askance, feeling that they were rivals, and mentally calculating each other's chances. 'There isn't much chance for me,' said Fosdick to Dick, who had accompanied him. 'Look at all these boys. Most of them have good homes, I suppose, and good recommendations, while I have nobody to refer to.' 'Go ahead,' said Dick. 'Your chance is as good as anybody's.' While this was passing between Dick and his companion, one of the boys, a rather supercilious-looking young gentleman, genteelly dressed, and evidently having a very high opinion of his dress and himself turned suddenly to Dick, and remarked,-- 'I've seen you before.' 'Oh, have you?' said Dick, whirling round; 'then p'r'aps you'd like to see me behind.' At this unexpected answer all the boys burst into a laugh with the exception of the questioner, who, evidently, considered that Dick had been disrespectful.\"\n  choice: \"'Ye had better land here,' said the lad, 'for the surf's running high at the Shellicoat Stane, and there will no be a dry thread amang us or we get the cargo out. Na! na! (in answer to an offer of money) ye have wrought for your passage, and wrought far better than ony o' us. Gude day to ye; I wuss ye weel.' So saying, he pushed oil in order to land his cargo on the opposite side of the bay; and Brown, with a small bundle in his hand, containing the trifling stock of necessaries which he had been obliged to purchase at Allonby, was left on the rocks beneath the ruin. And thus, unconscious as the most absolute stranger, and in circumstances which, if not destitute, were for the present highly embarrassing, without the countenance of a friend within the circle of several hundred miles, accused of a heavy crime, and, what was as bad as all the rest, being nearly penniless, did the harassed wanderer for the first time after the interval of so many years approach the remains of the castle where his ancestors had exercised all but regal dominion. CHAPTER XII Yes ye moss-green walls, Ye towers defenceless, I revisit ye Shame-stricken! Where are all your trophies now? Your thronged courts, the revelry, the tumult, That spoke the grandeur of my house, the homage Of neighbouring barons? Mysterious Mother. Entering the castle of Ellangowan by a postern doorway which showed symptoms of having been once secured with the most jealous care, Brown (whom, since he has set foot upon the property of his fathers, we shall hereafter call by his father's name of Bertram) wandered from one ruined apartment to another, surprised at the massive strength of some parts of the building, the rude and impressive magnificence of others, and the great extent of the whole. In two of these rooms, close beside each other, he saw signs of recent habitation. In one small apartment were empty bottles, half-gnawed bones, and dried fragments of bread. In the vault which adjoined, and which was defended by a strong door, then left open, he observed a considerable quantity of straw, and in both were the relics of recent fires. How little was it possible for Bertram to conceive that such trivial circumstances were closely connected with incidents affecting his prosperity, his honour, perhaps his life! After satisfying his curiosity by a hasty glance through the interior of the castle, Bertram now advanced through the great gateway which opened to the land, and paused to look upon the noble landscape which it commanded. Having in vain endeavoured to guess the position of Woodbourne, and having nearly ascertained that of Kippletringan, he turned to take a parting look at the stately ruins which he had just traversed. He admired the massive and picturesque effect of the huge round towers, which, flanking the gateway, gave a double portion of depth and majesty to the high yet gloomy arch under which it opened.\"\n  choice: \"'I wonder if I aint dreamin',' said Dick, once more surveying himself doubtfully in the glass. 'I'm afraid I'm dreamin', and shall wake up in a barrel, as I did night afore last.' 'Shall I pinch you so you can wake here?' asked Frank, playfully. 'Yes,' said Dick, seriously, 'I wish you would.' He pulled up the sleeve of his jacket, and Frank pinched him pretty hard, so that Dick winced. 'Yes, I guess I'm awake,' said Dick; 'you've got a pair of nippers, you have. But what shall I do with my brush and blacking?' he asked. 'You can leave them here till we come back,' said Frank. 'They will be safe.' 'Hold on a minute,' said Dick, surveying Frank's boots with a professional eye, 'you aint got a good shine on them boots. I'll make 'em shine so you can see your face in 'em.' And he was as good as his word. 'Thank you,' said Frank; 'now you had better brush your own shoes.' This had not occurred to Dick, for in general the professional boot-black considers his blacking too valuable to expend on his own shoes or boots, if he is fortunate enough to possess a pair. The two boys now went downstairs together. They met the same servant who had spoken to Dick a few minutes before, but there was no recognition. 'He don't know me,' said Dick. 'He thinks I'm a young swell like you.' 'What's a swell?' 'Oh, a feller that wears nobby clothes like you.' 'And you, too, Dick.' 'Yes,' said Dick, 'who'd ever have thought as I should have turned into a swell?' They had now got out on Broadway, and were slowly walking along the west side by the Park, when who should Dick see in front of him, but Johnny Nolan? Instantly Dick was seized with a fancy for witnessing Johnny's amazement at his change in appearance. He stole up behind him, and struck him on the back. 'Hallo, Johnny, how many shines have you had?' Johnny turned round expecting to see Dick, whose voice he recognized, but his astonished eyes rested on a nicely dressed boy (the hat alone excepted) who looked indeed like Dick, but so transformed in dress that it was difficult to be sure of his identity. 'What luck, Johnny?' repeated Dick. Johnny surveyed him from head to foot in great bewilderment. 'Who be you?' he said. 'Well, that's a good one,' laughed Dick; 'so you don't know Dick?' 'Where'd you get all them clothes?' asked Johnny. 'Have you been stealin'?' 'Say that again, and I'll lick you. No, I've lent my clothes to a young feller as was goin' to a party, and didn't have none fit to wear, and so I put on my second-best for a change.' Without deigning any further explanation, Dick went off, followed by the astonished gaze of Johnny Nolan, who could not quite make up his mind whether the neat-looking boy he had been talking with was really Ragged Dick or not.\"\nA:",

'Where'd you get all them clothes?' asked Johnny. 'Have you been stealin'?' 'Say that again, and I'll lick you. No, I've lent my clothes to a young feller as was goin' to a party, and didn't have none fit to wear, and so I put on my second-best for a change.' Without deigning any further explanation, Dick went off, followed by the astonished gaze of Johnny Nolan, who could not quite make up his mind whether the neat-looking boy he had been talking with was really Ragged Dick or not.\""

            "\"'Ye had better land here,' said the lad, 'for the surf's running high at the Shellicoat Stane, and there will no be a dry thread amang us or we get the cargo out. Na! na! (in answer to an offer of money) ye have wrought for your passage, and wrought far better than ony o' us. Gude day to ye; I wuss ye weel.' So saying, he pushed oil in order to land his cargo on the opposite side of the bay; and Brown, with a small bundle in his hand, containing the trifling stock of necessaries which he had been obliged to purchase at Allonby, was left on the rocks beneath the ruin. And thus, unconscious as the most absolute stranger, and in circumstances which, if not destitute, were for the present highly embarrassing, without the countenance of a friend within the circle of several hundred miles, accused of a heavy crime, and, what was as bad as all the rest, being nearly penniless, did the harassed wanderer for the first time after the interval of so many years approach the remains of the castle where his ancestors had exercised all but regal dominion. CHAPTER XII Yes ye moss-green walls, Ye towers defenceless, I revisit ye Shame-stricken! Where are all your trophies now? Your thronged courts, the revelry, the tumult, That spoke the grandeur of my house, the homage Of neighbouring barons? Mysterious Mother. Entering the castle of Ellangowan by a postern doorway which showed symptoms of having been once secured with the most jealous care, Brown (whom, since he has set foot upon the property of his fathers, we shall hereafter call by his father's name of Bertram) wandered from one ruined apartment to another, surprised at the massive strength of some parts of the building, the rude and impressive magnificence of others, and the great extent of the whole. In two of these rooms, close beside each other, he saw signs of recent habitation. In one small apartment were empty bottles, half-gnawed bones, and dried fragments of bread. In the vault which adjoined, and which was defended by a strong door, then left open, he observed a considerable quantity of straw, and in both were the relics of recent fires. How little was it possible for Bertram to conceive that such trivial circumstances were closely connected with incidents affecting his prosperity, his honour, perhaps his life! After satisfying his curiosity by a hasty glance through the interior of the castle, Bertram now advanced through the great gateway which opened to the land, and paused to look upon the noble landscape which it commanded. Having in vain endeavoured to guess the position of Woodbourne, and having nearly ascertained that of Kippletringan, he turned to take a parting look at the stately ruins which he had just traversed. He admired the massive and picturesque effect of the huge round towers, which, flanking the gateway, gave a double portion of depth and majesty to the high yet gloomy arch under which it opened.\"",
            "\"'I wonder if I aint dreamin',' said Dick, once more surveying himself doubtfully in the glass. 'I'm afraid I'm dreamin', and shall wake up in a barrel, as I did night afore last.' 'Shall I pinch you so you can wake here?' asked Frank, playfully. 'Yes,' said Dick, seriously, 'I wish you would.' He pulled up the sleeve of his jacket, and Frank pinched him pretty hard, so that Dick winced. 'Yes, I guess I'm awake,' said Dick; 'you've got a pair of nippers, you have. But what shall I do with my brush and blacking?' he asked. 'You can leave them here till we come back,' said Frank. 'They will be safe.' 'Hold on a minute,' said Dick, surveying Frank's boots with a professional eye, 'you aint got a good shine on them boots. I'll make 'em shine so you can see your face in 'em.' And he was as good as his word. 'Thank you,' said Frank; 'now you had better brush your own shoes.' This had not occurred to Dick, for in general the professional boot-black considers his blacking too valuable to expend on his own shoes or boots, if he is fortunate enough to possess a pair. The two boys now went downstairs together. They met the same servant who had spoken to Dick a few minutes before, but there was no recognition. 'He don't know me,' said Dick. 'He thinks I'm a young swell like you.' 'What's a swell?' 'Oh, a feller that wears nobby clothes like you.' 'And you, too, Dick.' 'Yes,' said Dick, 'who'd ever have thought as I should have turned into a swell?' They had now got out on Broadway, and were slowly walking along the west side by the Park, when who should Dick see in front of him, but Johnny Nolan? Instantly Dick was seized with a fancy for witnessing Johnny's amazement at his change in appearance. He stole up behind him, and struck him on the back. 'Hallo, Johnny, how many shines have you had?' Johnny turned round expecting to see Dick, whose voice he recognized, but his astonished eyes rested on a nicely dressed boy (the hat alone excepted) who looked indeed like Dick, but so transformed in dress that it was difficult to be sure of his identity. 'What luck, Johnny?' repeated Dick. Johnny surveyed him from head to foot in great bewilderment. 'Who be you?' he said. 'Well, that's a good one,' laughed Dick; 'so you don't know Dick?' 'Where'd you get all them clothes?' asked Johnny. 'Have you been stealin'?' 'Say that again, and I'll lick you. No, I've lent my clothes to a young feller as was goin' to a party, and didn't have none fit to wear, and so I put on my second-best for a change.'
