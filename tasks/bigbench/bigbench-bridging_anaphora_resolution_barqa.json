        "inputs": "Context: Magazine publishers are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles. But even a raft of recent failures isn't stopping them from launching new publications. At the American Magazine Conference here, publishers are plenty worried about the industry's woes. But they are also talking about new magazines. For example, Toronto-based Telemedia Inc. will publish Eating Well, a new food and health magazine due out next summer. New York-based Hearst Corp. this fall plans to publish its first issue of 9 Months, a magazine for expectant mothers, and has already launched American Home. And Time Warner Inc. is developing a spinoff of Time magazine aimed at kids, on the heels of its successful Sports Illustrated for Kids. Over the past four years, the number of consumer magazines has increased by an average of 80 magazines annually, according to Donald Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of America. \"This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry,\" said Mr. Kummerfeld. \"Entrepreneurs don't rush to get into a stagnant or declining industry.\" And despite the recent tough advertising climate, industry figures released at the meeting here indicate things may be turning around. For the first nine months, advertising pages in consumer magazines tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau increased 4% from the same period last year, to 125,849 pages. Total magazine ad revenue for the same period increased 12% to $4.6 billion. Though for some magazines categories a tough advertising climate persists, the industry in general is doing well compared with the newspaper industry. Though some magazines are thriving, the magazine publishing industry remains a risky business. Within the same nine months, News Corp. closed down In Fashion, a once-promising young woman's fashion magazine, Drake Publications Inc. has folded the long-troubled Venture magazine, and Lang Communications has announced Ms. magazine, after 17 years, will no longer carry advertising as of January. Lang is cutting costs and will attempt to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue. Meanwhile, American Health Partners, publisher of American Health magazine, is deep in debt, and Owen Lipstein, founder and managing partner, is being forced to sell the magazine to Reader's Digest Association Inc. Mr. Lipstein's absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble. Mr. Lipstein said in a telephone interview from New York that the sale was proceeding as planned. \"The magazine is strong. It's simply the right time to do what we are doing,\" Mr. Lipstein said. \"Magazines can no longer be considered institutions,\" said James Autry, president of Meredith Corp.'s magazine group. \"Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die,\" he added. \"Magazines could, like other brands, find that they have only a limited life.\" There are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs, traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-ups, are dwindling. More than ever, independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups, such as American Express Publishing Corp., a unit of American Express Co., and Conde Nast Publications Inc., a unit of Advance Publications Inc., which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers. Some entrepreneurs are still active, though.\nQuestion: Some entrepreneurs of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant, architect William McDonough seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting. He is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts. \"Look how much air is moving around!\" he says. \"The ventilation here is great!\" You may be hearing more about the 38-year-old Mr. McDonough and his preoccupation with clean air. After years of relative obscurity, he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture. Mr. McDonough believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution, tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues, and avoiding mahogany, which comes from endangered rain forests. He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant--\"architecturally impeccable,\" Progressive Architecture magazine called it--and his remodeling of Paul Stuart, the Madison Avenue clothing store. He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space. He is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts. What really stirs his muse, though, is aerobic architecture. Now the question is: Is Poland ready for it? Mr. McDonough is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet, the proposed Warsaw Trade Center in Poland, the first such center in Eastern Europe. The project has already acquired a certain New York cachet. Bloomingdale's plans to sell a foot-tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays. Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS. A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby's in December. If Mr. McDonough's plans get executed, as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum, steel and glass recycled from Warsaw's abundant rubble. A 20-story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space. Solar-powered batteries will make the spire glow. The windows will open. The carpets won't be glued down, and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes. To the extent that the $150 million budget will allow it, Mr. McDonough will rely on solid wood, rather than plywood or particle board, to limit the emission of formaldehyde. If Mr. McDonough has his way, the Poles will compensate for the trade center's emissions of carbon dioxide, a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear. The Poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $150,000, with the center's developer footing the bill. The news hasn't exactly moved others in Mr. McDonough's profession to become architectural Johnny Appleseeds. All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work, says John Burgee, whose New York firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square, \"but we can't all carry it to that extreme.\" Karen Nichols, senior associate at Michael Graves's architecture firm in Princeton, N.J., says: \"We're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily.\" Mr. McDonough responds: \"I'm asking people to broaden their agendas.\" The son of a Seagram's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world, Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights, Ohio, before entering Dartmouth College. He earned a master's degree in architecture from Yale. His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth. He and his father still spend time each summer fly-fishing for salmon in Iceland. Living in Hong Kong, he says, made him sensitive to the limits on food, power and water supplies. At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers. He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont. At Yale, he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in Ireland. Mr. McDonough's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York. The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big, operable windows. Since the 1970s energy crisis, some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect: high indoor pollution. To reduce it at the fund's building, workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director's office. Jute, rather than a synthetic material, lies under the tacked-down carpets, and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic. The budget was only $400,000. \"Athens with Spartan means,\" Mr. McDonough says. The fund's lawyers work in an Athenian grove of potted trees. Economists and administrators sit along a \"boulevard\" with street lamps and ficus trees. In offices, triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight. Offices with outside windows have inside windows, too, to let in more real daylight. \"We proved a healthy office doesn't cost more,\" says Frederic Krupp, executive director of the fund. It \"really looks beautiful and is very light,\" says Ann Hornaday, a free-lance writer who has visited the office for lunch meetings. But, she says, \"I guess I didn't really notice the trees. Maybe they were hidden by all the people.\" Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the Paul Stuart renovation reflects much of Mr. McDonough's environmental concern. The restaurant was conceived as a sparkling, crystalline \"geode.\" It makes extensive use of stainless steel, silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors. To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used for paneling at Paul Stuart, however, Mr. McDonough and friends planted 1,000 acorns around the country. The ambitious Warsaw project still awaits approval by city officials. Its developer is a Polish American, Sasha Muniak. He had worked with Mr. McDonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center.\nQuestion: an earlier project of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: Yet another political scandal is racking Japan. But this time it's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members. And as it unfolds, it's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society. Already, ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month. But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone. \"The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast,\" says Shigezo Hayasaka, former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst. But, he adds, \"We can't tell where it will go at all because we're still in the middle of it.\" This time, the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry. Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling. The donations so far appear to be small, especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year. But the implications could be great. Pachinko is slightly on the shady side, often linked to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders. Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions, and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe. Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners are Korean, many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents' organizations, and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan. To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory. Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country. Devotees pass hours, watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping, as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts. At 500 yen ($3.60) for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II. But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen (almost $92 billion), or nearly the size of Japan's vaunted automobile industry. And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion, some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen. If that money were being taxed, it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen. In 1984, an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions. Then, in 1988, a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament. The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin: North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral. In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members. The magazine alleged that in making the donations, the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren. The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report. And at first, neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue. But the press kept it alive; as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people who had received money. Within a matter of weeks, less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations. So far, though, there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members received amounted to bribes. Then the two camps upped the ante: Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members. The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization, and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ($880,000) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen. On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry, including 450,000 yen ($3,175) by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal. Direct donations from either of the residents' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign, but both groups deny making direct donations. They say it s possible some of their members may be donating privately. The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents, those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese.\nQuestion: Korean residents of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: Federal health officials are expected today to approve a program granting long-deferred access to the drug AZT for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Announcement of the approval is expected to be made by Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services. The clearance by the Food and Drug Administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of AIDS to the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease. The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status, a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval. The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection. Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the drug's usage for adults in March 1987. But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children, the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients. As a result, many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and, for the few exceptions, insurance carriers won't cover its cost of $6,400 a year. So far, AIDS has stricken 1,859 children under age 13, with many times that number believed to carry the infection without symptoms. To date, 1,013 of those children have died, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. Mothers of young AIDS patients expressed somber satisfaction. \"Thank goodness it's happening. It should have happened sooner,\" said Elizabeth Glaser, a Los Angeles mother and activist who contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion, and transmitted it to two of her children. One of them, a daughter Ariel, died a year ago at age seven after her parents unsuccessfully pleaded for the drug. \"I could get AZT,\" says Mrs. Glaser, who bears her infection without any symptoms. \"But my daughter couldn't, until she was too ill to take it. To watch your child die is an inhuman experience.\" Her son, healthy and symptom-free, currently takes no medication. The delay in getting AZT to children has been blamed on a combination of factors. Traditionally, the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses, because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape. Secondly, critics have charged AZT's maker Burroughs Wellcome Co. with corporate inertia because children account for just 1% of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market.\nQuestion: critics of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: Early this century, diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic Ocean was a day at the beach. Men would crawl in the sand looking for shiny stones. It was as easy as collecting sea shells at Malibu. Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes, searching for that unusual glint. But only after a fleet of 336 gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's diamond kingpins, do their work. Last year, 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover 934,242 carats, which comes to 46 tons of sand per carat, or one-fifth gram. Oh yes, the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards. \"If there's diamonds out there, we'll get to them,\" says Les Johns, De Beers's engineering manager. Here, wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world's most inhospitable diamond dig, lies the earth's most precious jewel box. Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature--first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa's interior, then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert--98% of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality. While other mines might yield more carats, a higher percentage of them go to industrial use. Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault, it has been turned into one. Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert--about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic--a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations. When the Germans lost World War I, they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers. Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers's stingy approval. The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa. Ghost towns dot the Namib dunes, proving diamonds aren't forever. Oranjemund, the mine headquarters, is a lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents. Jackals roam the streets at night, and gemsbok, hardy antelope with long straight horns, wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers. On most days, the desert's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag. The wind, stinging with sand, never seems to stop. Still, miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers's head offices in South Africa and London keep coming. And Oranjemund boasts attractions besides diamonds. There are six video rental shops, three restaurants, one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling. The pride of Oranjemund is the 18-hole golf course--with the largest sand trap in the world. Last year, when the rising Orange River threatened to swamp the course, the same engineers who are pushing back the Atlantic rushed to build a wall to hold back the flood. \"Nothing is too good for our golf course,\" says Tony George, a mining engineer. Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government following next month's elections freeing the country from South African control, De Beers engineers are working to extend the mine's productive life for another 25 years, from the current estimate of 10. Huge machines that look as though they came from the Star Wars desert-battle scene lumber among the dunes. Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator, with buckets instead of seats, chews through layers of compacted sand; tracks and conveyor belts, shuttling sand to the screening plants, criss-cross the beach. Then there is the artifical sea wall, 600 yards long and 60 yards thick, jutting into the ocean. Made of sand, it receives around-the-clock maintainence against the battering waves. When the mining in front of the wall is complete, it is moved northward. A companion jetty that helps hold back the sea looks like a rusting junkyard. Engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier, but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood. Then someone decided to try broken-down earthmoving equipment that, inexplicably, held against the waves. \"The Caterpillar people aren't too happy when they see their equipment used like that,\" shrugs Mr. George. \"They figure it's not a very good advert.\" Despite all these innovations, most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes--the ignominiously named \"bedrock sweepers\" who toil in the wake of the excavators.\nQuestion: the diamonds of what?\nAnswer:",

Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out. But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if OPEC doesn't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters. As a result, the effort by some oil ministers to get OPEC to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency. The organization is scheduled to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25. So far this year, rising demand for OPEC oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others. But that could change if demand for OPEC's oil softens seasonally early next year as some think may happen. OPEC is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day, sharply above its nominal, self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million, according to OPEC and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune. At that rate, a majority of OPEC's 13 members have reached their output limits, they said. But it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day--and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day--of spare capacity still exists within OPEC. Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries, including his own, Issam Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, told the conference Friday. He puts OPEC's current capacity at 28 million to 29 million barrels a day. That's higher than some other estimates. Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels a day. Either way, the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge. Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves, such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq, could upset the market. The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market. However, in interviews later, both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member. Under that approach, countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC's production ceiling than they would under the current system. \"If you are already producing at 95% or 100% of your capacity, what's the good to be told you can produce at 105% of capacity?\" asked Mr. Al-Chalabi. At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month, OPEC's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling. They doled it out using the existing formula, however, which meant that even those countries that couldn't produce more received higher official allotments. The main effect of the ceiling boost was to \"legitimize\" some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters. Still, there was a breakthrough at Geneva. Previously, no OPEC member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group's total output target, or ceiling. But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity, advanced there in an Iranian proposal, was generally endorsed by the ministers.\nQuestion: those of what?\nAnswer:",

Who'd have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like that would be school superintendents? Chicago's new school chief is the hard-nosed Ted Kimbrough. At his old job in Compton, Calif., he took a bitter teachers' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board member. At his first Chicago press conference, he berated the reporters. In New York City, the new Chancellor, Joseph Fernandez, has landed like a 16-inch shell in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform. Both men fit the mood of the times--the mood being one of a public fed up with officials' rationalizations for why their schools don't work. Former Patterson, N.J., principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator. The subject of the movie \"Lean on Me,\" Mr. Clark controlled his school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat. He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline, but isn't it interesting that some of the country's biggest, most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold? Elena Scambio, the woman assigned to run the Jersey City school system that was taken over by the state, says her top priority will be to \"cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy.\" Mr. Fernandez doesn't take control in New York until January, but already he's roiling the waters. He's attacked the concept of \"building tenure,\" one of the most disgraceful institutions in American public schools. It means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent principals. Once they are in the building, they stay. One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years, despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work. He was finally given leave when he was arrested for allegedly buying crack. Naturally, the principals' union loves building tenure, and tenure has withstood previous challenge. We suggest that Mr. Fernandez find an incompetent principal, toss him out of the building and let the forces of the status quo explain to the parents whatever it is they're defending.

        "inputs": "Context: The Polish rat will eat well this winter. Tons of delectably rotting potatoes, barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state's buyers away. Many a piglet won't be born as a result, and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop. But with inflation raging, grain in the barn will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank. Once again, the indomitable peasant holds Poland's future in his hands. Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system, even Solidarity's sympathetic new government won't win him over. In coming months, emergency food aid moving in from the West will be the one buffer between a meat-hungry public and a new political calamity. Factory workers on strike knocked Poland's Communist bosses off balance last year; this year, it was the farmers who brought them down. In June, farmers held onto meat, milk and grain, waiting for July's usual state-directed price rises. The Communists froze prices instead. The farmers ran a boycott, and meat disappeared from the shops. On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls, and food prices leaped. Without buffer stocks, inflation exploded. That was when the tame old Peasants' Party, desperate to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the Communists and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc's first liberated government. But by the time Solidarity took office in September, the damage was done. \"Shortageflation,\" as economists have come to call it, had gone hyper. The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one. The farmers stayed angry. They still are. At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw, hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell. Here, they are searching for a higher price. In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field, Andrzej Latowski wrestles a screeching, overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher's Polish Fiat. \"Of course it's better to sell private,\" he says, as the butcher trundles away. \"Why should anybody want to sell to them?\" The young farmer makes money on the few hogs he sells here. He won't for long, because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up. \"There's no feed,\" he says. \"You can't buy anything nowadays. I don't know why.\" Edward Chojnowski does. His truck is parked across the field, in a row of grain sellers. Like the others, it is loaded with rye, wheat and oats in sacks labeled \"Asbestos. Made in U.S.S.R.\" The farmer at the next truck shouts, \"Wheat! It's nice! It won't be cheaper! We sell direct!\" A heavy, kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers, and counts him out a pile of zlotys. \"Country people breed pigs,\" says Mr. Chojnowski, leaning against the back of his truck. \"They can't buy feed from the state. There isn't enough. Some state middlemen come to buy from me. I sell--a little. I am waiting. I have plenty more at home.\" On this morning, he doesn't sell much in Radzymin, either. At closing time, farmers cart out most of what they carted in. A private market like this just isn't big enough to absorb all that business. The hulk of Stalinism, it seems, will not quickly crumble away. State monopolies will keep on stifling trade, \"free\" prices or not, until something else replaces them. Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement, processing and distribution--plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors, pesticides, fertilizers and feed. The Communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here. Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job that Solidarity has barely started. But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already: the private farmer. \"We are dealing with real entrepreneurs,\" says Antoni Leopold, an economist who advises Rural Solidarity, the union's countryside offshoot. \"There are a lot of them, and they have property.\" Polish peasants, spurning the collectivizers, were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists. Now, among Communist reformers, they are objects of envy. Food is the reformer's top priority, the key to popular support. As the Chinese have shown and the Soviets are learning, family farms thrive where collectives fail. Ownership, it seems, is the best fertilizer. The Poles have had it all along. Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try. A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms. Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz owns 30 acres in 14 scattered scraps. He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens, five cows and 25 piglets. In patched pants and torn shoes, he stands in his barnyard eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic.\nQuestion: the ground of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to keep the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment and enable Southern blacks to go to the polls, unhindered by literacy tests and other exclusionary devices. Twenty-five years later, the Voting Rights Act has been transformed by the courts and the Justice Department into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities--Hispanics, Asians and native Americans--holding elective office. In the 1980s, the Justice Department and lower federal courts that enforce the Voting Rights Act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of \"safe\" minority election districts--districts where minorities form between 65% and 80% of the voting population. The program has even been called upon to create \"safe\" white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority. Although Section 2 of the act expressly disclaims requiring that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices, few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the Justice Department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they carve out as many solidly minority districts as possible. The new goal of the Voting Rights Act--more minorities in political office--is laudable. For the political process to work, all citizens, regardless of race, must feel represented. One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency. As is, blacks constitute 12% of the population, but fewer than 2% of elected leaders. But racial gerrymandering is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal. It is a quick fix for a complex problem. Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black, white, Hispanic and other minority voters, drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter's and the candidate's most important trait. Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person, and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one. Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities--New York and Birmingham, Ala. When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census, every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue. New York City: Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970, when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern states. In 1972, the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes, despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts. This year, a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York's system of government completed a new charter, expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members. Sometime in 1991, as soon as the 1990 census becomes available, a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district lines. The Charter Revision Commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the Justice Department and the commission's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership, the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts. Blacks and Hispanics currently make up 38% of the city's population and hold only 25% of the seats on the council. Several of the city's black leaders, including Democratic mayoral nominee David Dinkins, have spoken out for racial gerrymandering to accord blacks and Hispanics \"the fullest opportunity for representation.\"\nQuestion: Democratic mayoral nominee of what?\nAnswer:",

Estimates of damage in the six-county San Francisco Bay area neared $5 billion, excluding the cost of repairing the region's transportation system. The Bay Bridge, the main artery into San Francisco from the east, will be closed for at least several weeks. Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. The bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day. Also, most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south, the 101 freeway, have been closed for repairs. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which runs subway trains beneath the bay, is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000. BART has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for the onslaught. Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the East Bay towns of Oakland and Berkeley. For the first time in 32 years, ferry service has been restored between the East Bay and San Francisco. The Red and White Fleet, which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County, and tourist tours of the bay, is offering East Bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $10 round-trip. That tariff is too stiff for some Financial District wage earners. \"I'll stay with BART,\" said one secretary, swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube. Officials expect the Golden Gate Bridge to be swamped with an extra load of commuters, including East Bay residents making a long detour. \"We're anticipating quite a traffic crunch,\" said one official. About 23,000 people typically travel over the Golden Gate Bridge during commute hours. About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period. Meetings canceled by Apple Computer Inc.'s European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants. It also raised hackles of the city's tourism boosters. \"Other cities are calling -LCB- groups booked here for tours and conferences -RCB- and--not to be crass--stealing our booking list,\" said Scott Shafer, a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos. City officials stuck by their estimate of $2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city. The other five Bay area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $2.8 billion. All estimates exclude highway repair, which could exceed $1 billion. Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in San Francisco that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage. The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the Embarcadero Freeway. Until it was closed Tuesday, it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the Financial District. Engineers say it will take at least eight months to repair the Embarcadero structure.
