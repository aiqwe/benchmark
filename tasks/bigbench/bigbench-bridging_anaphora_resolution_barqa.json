        "inputs": "Context: Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant, architect William McDonough seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting. He is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts. \"Look how much air is moving around!\" he says. \"The ventilation here is great!\" You may be hearing more about the 38-year-old Mr. McDonough and his preoccupation with clean air. After years of relative obscurity, he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture. Mr. McDonough believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution, tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues, and avoiding mahogany, which comes from endangered rain forests. He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant--\"architecturally impeccable,\" Progressive Architecture magazine called it--and his remodeling of Paul Stuart, the Madison Avenue clothing store. He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space. He is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts. What really stirs his muse, though, is aerobic architecture. Now the question is: Is Poland ready for it? Mr. McDonough is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet, the proposed Warsaw Trade Center in Poland, the first such center in Eastern Europe. The project has already acquired a certain New York cachet. Bloomingdale's plans to sell a foot-tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays. Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS. A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby's in December. If Mr. McDonough's plans get executed, as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum, steel and glass recycled from Warsaw's abundant rubble. A 20-story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space. Solar-powered batteries will make the spire glow. The windows will open. The carpets won't be glued down, and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes. To the extent that the $150 million budget will allow it, Mr. McDonough will rely on solid wood, rather than plywood or particle board, to limit the emission of formaldehyde. If Mr. McDonough has his way, the Poles will compensate for the trade center's emissions of carbon dioxide, a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear. The Poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $150,000, with the center's developer footing the bill. The news hasn't exactly moved others in Mr. McDonough's profession to become architectural Johnny Appleseeds. All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work, says John Burgee, whose New York firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square, \"but we can't all carry it to that extreme.\" Karen Nichols, senior associate at Michael Graves's architecture firm in Princeton, N.J., says: \"We're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily.\" Mr. McDonough responds: \"I'm asking people to broaden their agendas.\" The son of a Seagram's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world, Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights, Ohio, before entering Dartmouth College. He earned a master's degree in architecture from Yale. His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth. He and his father still spend time each summer fly-fishing for salmon in Iceland. Living in Hong Kong, he says, made him sensitive to the limits on food, power and water supplies. At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers. He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont. At Yale, he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in Ireland. Mr. McDonough's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York. The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big, operable windows. Since the 1970s energy crisis, some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect: high indoor pollution. To reduce it at the fund's building, workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director's office. Jute, rather than a synthetic material, lies under the tacked-down carpets, and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic. The budget was only $400,000. \"Athens with Spartan means,\" Mr. McDonough says. The fund's lawyers work in an Athenian grove of potted trees. Economists and administrators sit along a \"boulevard\" with street lamps and ficus trees. In offices, triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight. Offices with outside windows have inside windows, too, to let in more real daylight. \"We proved a healthy office doesn't cost more,\" says Frederic Krupp, executive director of the fund. It \"really looks beautiful and is very light,\" says Ann Hornaday, a free-lance writer who has visited the office for lunch meetings. But, she says, \"I guess I didn't really notice the trees. Maybe they were hidden by all the people.\" Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the Paul Stuart renovation reflects much of Mr. McDonough's environmental concern. The restaurant was conceived as a sparkling, crystalline \"geode.\" It makes extensive use of stainless steel, silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors.\nQuestion: a gray terrazzo of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: The Polish rat will eat well this winter. Tons of delectably rotting potatoes, barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state's buyers away. Many a piglet won't be born as a result, and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop. But with inflation raging, grain in the barn will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank. Once again, the indomitable peasant holds Poland's future in his hands. Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system, even Solidarity's sympathetic new government won't win him over. In coming months, emergency food aid moving in from the West will be the one buffer between a meat-hungry public and a new political calamity. Factory workers on strike knocked Poland's Communist bosses off balance last year; this year, it was the farmers who brought them down. In June, farmers held onto meat, milk and grain, waiting for July's usual state-directed price rises. The Communists froze prices instead. The farmers ran a boycott, and meat disappeared from the shops. On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls, and food prices leaped. Without buffer stocks, inflation exploded. That was when the tame old Peasants' Party, desperate to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the Communists and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc's first liberated government. But by the time Solidarity took office in September, the damage was done. \"Shortageflation,\" as economists have come to call it, had gone hyper. The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one. The farmers stayed angry. They still are. At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw, hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell. Here, they are searching for a higher price. In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field, Andrzej Latowski wrestles a screeching, overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher's Polish Fiat. \"Of course it's better to sell private,\" he says, as the butcher trundles away. \"Why should anybody want to sell to them?\" The young farmer makes money on the few hogs he sells here. He won't for long, because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up. \"There's no feed,\" he says. \"You can't buy anything nowadays. I don't know why.\" Edward Chojnowski does. His truck is parked across the field, in a row of grain sellers. Like the others, it is loaded with rye, wheat and oats in sacks labeled \"Asbestos. Made in U.S.S.R.\" The farmer at the next truck shouts, \"Wheat! It's nice! It won't be cheaper! We sell direct!\" A heavy, kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers, and counts him out a pile of zlotys. \"Country people breed pigs,\" says Mr. Chojnowski, leaning against the back of his truck. \"They can't buy feed from the state. There isn't enough. Some state middlemen come to buy from me. I sell--a little. I am waiting. I have plenty more at home.\" On this morning, he doesn't sell much in Radzymin, either. At closing time, farmers cart out most of what they carted in. A private market like this just isn't big enough to absorb all that business. The hulk of Stalinism, it seems, will not quickly crumble away. State monopolies will keep on stifling trade, \"free\" prices or not, until something else replaces them. Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement, processing and distribution--plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors, pesticides, fertilizers and feed. The Communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here. Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job that Solidarity has barely started. But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already: the private farmer. \"We are dealing with real entrepreneurs,\" says Antoni Leopold, an economist who advises Rural Solidarity, the union's countryside offshoot. \"There are a lot of them, and they have property.\" Polish peasants, spurning the collectivizers, were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists. Now, among Communist reformers, they are objects of envy. Food is the reformer's top priority, the key to popular support. As the Chinese have shown and the Soviets are learning, family farms thrive where collectives fail. Ownership, it seems, is the best fertilizer. The Poles have had it all along. Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try. A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms. Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz owns 30 acres in 14 scattered scraps. He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens, five cows and 25 piglets. In patched pants and torn shoes, he stands in his barnyard eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic. \"It's bad soil,\" he says. Until 1963, it was good soil. Then the state put in a reservoir to supply the area with drinking water. Farmers lay down before the bulldozers. Their protest was ignored. The dam caused the water level to drop in Zalubice. Mr Pyszkiewicz smiles and his brow furrows. He expected as much. In his lifetime, 47 years, the Communists brought electricity to his village and piped in drinking water from the reservoir. No phones. No gas. \"We wanted them to build a road here,\" he says. \"They started, and then abandoned it.\" A tractor, his only mechanized equipment, stands in front of the pigsty. \"It's Russian. Good for nothing. Parts are a tragedy. Even if I had a lot of money, I couldn't buy what I need.\" The farmer can say the same for coal, cement, saw blades. In Poland, only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want; in the West, it is closer to 20%. The few big state farms take first crack at what does get made. They use 60% more fertilizer per acre, twice the high-grade feed. Yet their best boast is that they produce 32% of Polish pork. \"I've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized,\" Mr. Pyszkiewicz says as his wife, Wieslawa, sets some chairs out in the sun. \"We have one near here. There is a lot of waste. A private farmer never wastes anything.\" The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain. A private farmer in Poland is free to buy and sell land, hire help, decide what to grow and how to grow it. He is free to invest in chickens, and to fail for lack of chicken wire. He has plenty of freedom--but no choices. \"I'm on my own land,\" Mr. Pyszkiewicz says. \"I don't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do.\" \"Sometimes,\" says his wife, \"we're happy about that.\" By starving the peasant, the Communists have starved Poland. Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors. Farm income is 15% below the average. The young leave, especially girls who won't milk cows by hand. Some men stay, their best friend a bottle of vodka, but two million acres have gone fallow. Without machines, good farms can't get bigger. So the potato crop, once 47 million tons, is down to 35 million. Meat consumption is at 1979's level, pork production at 1973's, milk output at 1960's. If a food crisis undid the Communists, a food revolution will make Solidarity. The potential is displayed along every road into Warsaw: row upon row of greenhouses, stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners' wealth. Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland, the pickles and sauerkraut sublime, the state monopolies long broken. Grain, milk and meat come next. A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare, although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast. Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale. Solidarity wants it from the West. Maria Stolzman, one of its farm experts, lays it on the line: \"The World Bank will be brought in to help us destroy the old system.\"\nQuestion: the old system of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: In Poland's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative, environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy, cut cumbersome bureaucracies, and democratize local politics. Initial steps were taken at Poland's first international environmental conference, which I attended last month. The conference, held in Lower Silesia, was co-sponsored by the Environment Ministry, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the Polish Ecological Club, and was attended by 50 Poles from government and industry, as well as Hungarians, Czechs, Russians, Japanese and Americans. The conference was entitled \"Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection,\" a significant departure from East Bloc usage, which recognizes only one economic mechanism--central planning--to direct industrial behavior. Even more remarkably, it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution, notwithstanding Poland's lack of functioning markets. Why did East Bloc participants unanimously endorse market-based pollution approaches? The answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation. Like other East Bloc countries, Poland possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance. According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey Institute, 27 areas containing a third of Poland's population are regarded as \"ecological hazards\" due to multiple violations of standards. Norms are consistently exceeded at 60% of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80% of those for dust and soot emissions. Four-fifths of Poland's soils have become highly acidified; 70% of its southern forests are projected to die by century's end. Between 1965 and 1985, Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33% to 6% of all surface waters, while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled. Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe. Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50% higher than West Germany's, and 50% higher in hazard areas than the national average. Since 1978, average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP. Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from (a) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources, which are not produced by labor; (b) planned economies' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government; and (c) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development, producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West. They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership, genuine competition based on market factors, and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions. The solutions they formally proposed included lead / sulfur taxes, conservation and recycling incentives, reforestation offsets, transferable pollution permits, an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits, and debt-for-environment swaps. But their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state, making it fully accountable for pollution control. A revolution takes more than conference manifestos. Indeed, skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by Poles at the conference: \"The world must be coming to an end. The Russians are talking peace. The Palestinians are talking elections. And the Poles are engaged in commerce.\" But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution, or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year. Those implications include:--Privatization. Faced with a $40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation, Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance. Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries. But it could also accelerate \"marketization\" by reinforcing industrial accountability, breaking up state monopolies, giving managers a stake in solutions, and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects.--Least-cost solutions. As conferees noted, scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms. That means simple, clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction, deferring more complex issues such as risk.\nQuestion: reduction of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: Yet another political scandal is racking Japan. But this time it's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members. And as it unfolds, it's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society. Already, ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month. But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone. \"The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast,\" says Shigezo Hayasaka, former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst. But, he adds, \"We can't tell where it will go at all because we're still in the middle of it.\" This time, the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry. Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling. The donations so far appear to be small, especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year. But the implications could be great. Pachinko is slightly on the shady side, often linked to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders. Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions, and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe. Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners are Korean, many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents' organizations, and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan. To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory. Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country. Devotees pass hours, watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping, as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts. At 500 yen ($3.60) for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II. But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen (almost $92 billion), or nearly the size of Japan's vaunted automobile industry. And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion, some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen. If that money were being taxed, it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen. In 1984, an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions. Then, in 1988, a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament. The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin: North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral. In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members. The magazine alleged that in making the donations, the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren. The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report. And at first, neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue. But the press kept it alive; as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people who had received money. Within a matter of weeks, less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations. So far, though, there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members received amounted to bribes. Then the two camps upped the ante: Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members. The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization, and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ($880,000) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen. On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry, including 450,000 yen ($3,175) by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.\nQuestion: the chief cabinet secretary of what?\nAnswer:",

IBM, which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here, said it invited many other companies to participate as well, including some from Europe. Jack Kuehler, IBM's president, said IBM is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific. IBM, which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work, has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally U.S. industry to head off the Japanese, who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips. While IBM, Armonk, N.Y., makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses, it doesn't make the equipment needed to produce those chips. And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market, too, unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy. Failure of U.S. equipment makers, IBM fears, would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market. IBM also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that Motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing. IBM already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques. IBM said it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive.

Although the half-hour situation comedy seen Mondays at 9:30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time isn't a candidate for cancellation, it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may announce \"Teddy Z\" is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot, replacing \"The People Next Door,\" which became the first network show to be canceled this season. \"Teddy Z,\" which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a Hollywood talent agency, was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow \"Murphy Brown,\" a situation comedy about a television news magazine, starring Candice Bergen. \"Teddy Z\" was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with K mart Corp. It was promoted on cable services, including MTV, Nick at Night and VH-1, and premiered as the No. 22-rated show for the week. But five weeks after the premiere, the series has floundered. In figures released yesterday by A.C. Nielsen Co. \"Teddy Z,\" produced by the television unit of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., was in 37th place. Worse, every week it suffers audience drop-off from \"Murphy Brown\" and viewership on CBS picks up again once \"Teddy Z\" is over and is followed by \"Designing Women.\" \"There is strong indication that'Teddy Z' is not compatible with the shows it is surrounding,\" said John Sisk, senior vice president at J. Walter Thompson Co., a unit of WPP Group PLC. Last week, \"Murphy Brown\" was viewed by 14.1% of the available television households, while the number dropped to 12.6% for \"Teddy Z\" and rose to 14.2% for \"Designing Women.\" CBS executives said the program is also slated to undergo some plot changes. Creator Hugh Wilson, for example, included the lead character's Greek family in the cast, \"but that is not the right focus anymore,\" said one CBS executive. Instead, CBS hopes the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent. \"We're making adjustments on the show, yes, but nothing radical,\" said Craig Nelson, the story consultant on \"Teddy Z.\" \"But we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family.\" The opening credits are being redone, Mr. Nelson said, \"to make Teddy's situation clear to viewers who have not been with us since the beginning.\nQuestion: viewers of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: When Robert McDuffie was 14, he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in Macon, Ga. Unfortunately, his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night, and she was adamant about his attending. \"I threw such a fit,\" says Mr. McDuffie, who had begun violin studies at the age of six. \"But once Perlman started playing, I didn't give a damn about basketball.... Afterwards, I went home and practiced for three hours.\" Today, it's obvious that the brawny, six-foot, one-inch musician made the right choice. At 31, Mr. McDuffie has a rich, full-bodied tone, an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule. He's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia, with stops including Charleston, S.C. (Oct. 25), Sarasota, Fla. (Oct. 28), Tampa, Fla. (Oct. 29) and Miami (Oct. 31). Later this season he gives a recital at Washington's Kennedy Center, and appears as soloist with several major orchestras. Yet Mr. McDuffie's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries. During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical \"brat pack\"--a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay. His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz, a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student; Cho-Liang Lin, who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition. \"I thought I was over the hill at 22,\" recalls Mr. McDuffie, an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl. \"But I wasn't ready for a career at that time.\" Young McDuffie's first violin teacher was Henrik Schwarzenberger, a Hungarian refugee who taught in the Macon public school system. \"He taught me how to play like a gypsy,\" jokes the musician. \"I didn't learn to count until I got to Juilliard.\" After studies at that conservatory's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian, he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay, Mr. Galamian's longtime assistant and, ultimately, his rival. \"I think I had to prove myself to her,\" says Mr. McDuffie. \"But she was always encouraging. She only put her foot down twice,\" he continues. \"In my freshman year, my roommate was known as a party animal. She thought I wasn't getting my practicing done.\" As the violinist tells it, his grandmotherly looking teacher \"put her hands on her hips, stomped her foot and said,'You've just got to get the -LCB- expletive deleted -RCB- out of there.'\" The second incident took place after Mr. McDuffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself. Miss DeLay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital. \"We listened to the Chausson'Poeme,'\" he recalls, \"and she said,'You hear the first note, that B-flat? That's the only note that's truly in tune...'.\" \"That's the most important experience I've had with any teacher,\" he says, \"because she taught me how to listen. Now, when I play with orchestras, the musicians often compliment me on my intonation.\" It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative, 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber. After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter's \"Violin Concerto,\" Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer, who was dying of cancer. \"Barber was seated by the fireplace looking very pale,\" recalls the violinist, who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer's apartment. \"He didn't say much, but what he said was important because it's not in the score. There's a beautiful, Coplandesque motif--he'd kill me if he heard me say that--throughout the first movement... The only time the violin has it is right at the end. It's written'marcato' in the score, and I played it that way, kind of gigue-like. And he yelled out'dolce! dolce!' -LCB-'sweet! sweet!' -RCB-.\" \"So we did it over,\" he adds. \"I played very transparently, with the tip of the bow. If a conductor is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra -LCB- volume -RCB- at that point, it makes the piece magical. I don't know why Barber never told anybody else. On Isaac Stern's recording it's very biting.\" Since leaving Juilliard, Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones. His guest appearance on the NBC soap opera \"Another World,\" scandalized musical elitists. By contrast, he's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman's \"Violin Concerto,\" which he recently recorded for Angel / EMI along with Leonard Bernstein's engaging \"Serenade for Violin Solo, Strings and Percussion.\" Mr. McDuffie's sweet tone, heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works. Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin's direction, this \"Serenade\" really swings. Mr. Schuman's \"Violin Concerto,\" which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment, meanders until the propulsive \"Agitato, fervente.\" But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist, brass and timpani. At Avery Fisher Hall here, Mr. McDuffie was heard recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare--Bruch's overwrought \"Violin Concerto in G Minor.\" His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed. The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big, lush sound that belied its size. Whatever he plays, Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself--\"something greater out there than me,\" as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment he shares with wife, Camille, a literary publicist. \"A normal person did not write the Beethoven'Violin Concerto,'\" he declares. \"Even when I hear it played badly, I'm still humbled by the piece. If I could ever feel I've contributed to it in some way, then all the hard work has been worth it.\"\nQuestion: all the hard work of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: When the Trinity Repertory Theater named Anne Bogart its artistic director last spring, the nation's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow. Ms. Bogart, an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"South Pacific,\" is decidedly downtown. Trinity Rep meanwhile is one of the nation's oldest and most respected regional theaters, still hosting an annual \"A Christmas Carol.\" How would this bastion of traditional values fare in Ms. Bogart's iconoclastic hands? She held her fire with her first production at the Trinity earlier this season. It was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-Broadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht's theoretical writings, called \"No Plays, No Poetry.\" Now, with the opening of Maxim Gorky's bourgeois-bashing \"Summerfolk,\" Ms. Bogart has laid her cards on the table. Hers is a hand that will test the mettle of her audiences. For Ms. Bogart, who initially studied and directed in Germany (and cites such European directors as Peter Stein, Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine as influences) tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor--whether the text demands it or not. And Gorky, considered the father of Soviet socialist realism, did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques. Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism. And \"Summerfolk,\" penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov's \"Cherry Orchard,\" is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers. Along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances. Wisely Ms. Bogart has kept Gorky's time and place intact. Despite the absence of samovars (and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down), the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton, with boaters and fishing poles aplenty. But beyond this decorative nod to tradition, Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms Gorky's naturalistic drama into something akin to, well, farce. The director's attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered. Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them, but they often literally stand on their heads. Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls, sprawling them on staircases, dangling them off tables, even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do. There are moments in this \"Summerfolk\" when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house (which looks like a parody of Frank Lloyd Wright and is designed by Victoria Petrovich) spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of \"Laugh In.\" \"Talk hurts from where it spurts,\" one of them says. The clash of ideologies survives this treatment, but the nuance and richness of Gorky's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle. As for the humor that Gorky's text provides, when repainted in such broad strokes (particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble) it looks and sounds forced. Ms. Bogart does better with music than with words when she wants, as she so often does want, to express herself through Gorky's helpless play. Here she has the aid of her longtime associate Jeff Helpern, whom she appointed Trinity's first-ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new $60,000 sound system and recording studio. For Gorky, Mr. Helpern provided an aural collage of Debussy and Rachmaninoff, which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view. Like Brecht, and indeed Ezra Pound, Ms. Bogart has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to \"make it new.\" Indeed, during a recent post-production audience discussion, the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" so that the song's \"original beauty comes through,\" surmounting the cliche. The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation, a vision so at odds with the playwright's that the two points of view nullify, rather than illuminate, each other. Ms. Bogart's cast is part and parcel of the problem. Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish, idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna. Cynthia Strickland as the long-suffering Varvara is a tiresome whiner, not the inspirational counterrevolutionary Gorky intended. Better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse. Janice Duclos, in addition to possessing one of the evening's more impressive vocal instruments, brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of Olga, everybody's favorite mom.

Explosions shook a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near Pasadena, Texas, hurling debris and causing a fire visible from 10 miles away. More than 100 people were injured, and a number of workers were missing. Parts of the Houston Ship Channel were closed. The White House said Bush is conferring with leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee to ease differences over guidelines for CIA agents. The statement came after officials said Bush complained at a private meeting last week that a strict interpretation of a policy requires the U.S. to notify foreign dictators of certain coup plots.\nQuestion: a policy of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: When Robert McDuffie was 14, he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in Macon, Ga. Unfortunately, his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night, and she was adamant about his attending. \"I threw such a fit,\" says Mr. McDuffie, who had begun violin studies at the age of six. \"But once Perlman started playing, I didn't give a damn about basketball.... Afterwards, I went home and practiced for three hours.\" Today, it's obvious that the brawny, six-foot, one-inch musician made the right choice. At 31, Mr. McDuffie has a rich, full-bodied tone, an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule. He's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia, with stops including Charleston, S.C. (Oct. 25), Sarasota, Fla. (Oct. 28), Tampa, Fla. (Oct. 29) and Miami (Oct. 31). Later this season he gives a recital at Washington's Kennedy Center, and appears as soloist with several major orchestras. Yet Mr. McDuffie's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries. During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical \"brat pack\"--a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay. His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz, a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student; Cho-Liang Lin, who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition. \"I thought I was over the hill at 22,\" recalls Mr. McDuffie, an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl. \"But I wasn't ready for a career at that time.\" Young McDuffie's first violin teacher was Henrik Schwarzenberger, a Hungarian refugee who taught in the Macon public school system. \"He taught me how to play like a gypsy,\" jokes the musician. \"I didn't learn to count until I got to Juilliard.\" After studies at that conservatory's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian, he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay, Mr. Galamian's longtime assistant and, ultimately, his rival. \"I think I had to prove myself to her,\" says Mr. McDuffie. \"But she was always encouraging. She only put her foot down twice,\" he continues. \"In my freshman year, my roommate was known as a party animal. She thought I wasn't getting my practicing done.\" As the violinist tells it, his grandmotherly looking teacher \"put her hands on her hips, stomped her foot and said,'You've just got to get the -LCB- expletive deleted -RCB- out of there.'\" The second incident took place after Mr. McDuffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself. Miss DeLay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital. \"We listened to the Chausson'Poeme,'\" he recalls, \"and she said,'You hear the first note, that B-flat? That's the only note that's truly in tune...'.\" \"That's the most important experience I've had with any teacher,\" he says, \"because she taught me how to listen. Now, when I play with orchestras, the musicians often compliment me on my intonation.\" It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative, 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber. After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter's \"Violin Concerto,\" Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer, who was dying of cancer. \"Barber was seated by the fireplace looking very pale,\" recalls the violinist, who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer's apartment. \"He didn't say much, but what he said was important because it's not in the score. There's a beautiful, Coplandesque motif--he'd kill me if he heard me say that--throughout the first movement... The only time the violin has it is right at the end. It's written'marcato' in the score, and I played it that way, kind of gigue-like. And he yelled out'dolce! dolce!' -LCB-'sweet! sweet!' -RCB-.\" \"So we did it over,\" he adds. \"I played very transparently, with the tip of the bow. If a conductor is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra -LCB- volume -RCB- at that point, it makes the piece magical. I don't know why Barber never told anybody else. On Isaac Stern's recording it's very biting.\" Since leaving Juilliard, Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones. His guest appearance on the NBC soap opera \"Another World,\" scandalized musical elitists. By contrast, he's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman's \"Violin Concerto,\" which he recently recorded for Angel / EMI along with Leonard Bernstein's engaging \"Serenade for Violin Solo, Strings and Percussion.\" Mr. McDuffie's sweet tone, heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works. Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin's direction, this \"Serenade\" really swings. Mr. Schuman's \"Violin Concerto,\" which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment, meanders until the propulsive \"Agitato, fervente.\" But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist, brass and timpani. At Avery Fisher Hall here, Mr. McDuffie was heard recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare--Bruch's overwrought \"Violin Concerto in G Minor.\" His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed. The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big, lush sound that belied its size. Whatever he plays, Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself--\"something greater out there than me,\" as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment he shares with wife, Camille, a literary publicist. \"A normal person did not write the Beethoven'Violin Concerto,'\" he declares. \"Even when I hear it played badly, I'm still humbled by the piece. If I could ever feel I've contributed to it in some way, then all the hard work has been worth it.\"\nQuestion: all the hard work of what?\nAnswer:",
