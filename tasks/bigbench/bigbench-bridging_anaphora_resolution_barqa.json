        "inputs": "Context: Yet another political scandal is racking Japan. But this time it's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members. And as it unfolds, it's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society. Already, ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month. But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone. \"The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast,\" says Shigezo Hayasaka, former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst. But, he adds, \"We can't tell where it will go at all because we're still in the middle of it.\" This time, the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry. Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling. The donations so far appear to be small, especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year. But the implications could be great. Pachinko is slightly on the shady side, often linked to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders. Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions, and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe. Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners are Korean, many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents' organizations, and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan. To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory. Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country. Devotees pass hours, watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping, as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts. At 500 yen ($3.60) for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II. But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen (almost $92 billion), or nearly the size of Japan's vaunted automobile industry. And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion, some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen. If that money were being taxed, it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen. In 1984, an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions. Then, in 1988, a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament. The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin: North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral. In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members. The magazine alleged that in making the donations, the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren.\nQuestion: the North Korean residents of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: The Polish rat will eat well this winter. Tons of delectably rotting potatoes, barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state's buyers away. Many a piglet won't be born as a result, and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop. But with inflation raging, grain in the barn will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank. Once again, the indomitable peasant holds Poland's future in his hands. Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system, even Solidarity's sympathetic new government won't win him over. In coming months, emergency food aid moving in from the West will be the one buffer between a meat-hungry public and a new political calamity. Factory workers on strike knocked Poland's Communist bosses off balance last year; this year, it was the farmers who brought them down. In June, farmers held onto meat, milk and grain, waiting for July's usual state-directed price rises. The Communists froze prices instead. The farmers ran a boycott, and meat disappeared from the shops. On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls, and food prices leaped. Without buffer stocks, inflation exploded. That was when the tame old Peasants' Party, desperate to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the Communists and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc's first liberated government. But by the time Solidarity took office in September, the damage was done. \"Shortageflation,\" as economists have come to call it, had gone hyper. The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one. The farmers stayed angry. They still are. At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw, hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell. Here, they are searching for a higher price. In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field, Andrzej Latowski wrestles a screeching, overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher's Polish Fiat. \"Of course it's better to sell private,\" he says, as the butcher trundles away. \"Why should anybody want to sell to them?\" The young farmer makes money on the few hogs he sells here. He won't for long, because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up. \"There's no feed,\" he says. \"You can't buy anything nowadays. I don't know why.\" Edward Chojnowski does. His truck is parked across the field, in a row of grain sellers. Like the others, it is loaded with rye, wheat and oats in sacks labeled \"Asbestos. Made in U.S.S.R.\" The farmer at the next truck shouts, \"Wheat! It's nice! It won't be cheaper! We sell direct!\" A heavy, kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers, and counts him out a pile of zlotys. \"Country people breed pigs,\" says Mr. Chojnowski, leaning against the back of his truck. \"They can't buy feed from the state. There isn't enough. Some state middlemen come to buy from me. I sell--a little. I am waiting. I have plenty more at home.\" On this morning, he doesn't sell much in Radzymin, either. At closing time, farmers cart out most of what they carted in. A private market like this just isn't big enough to absorb all that business. The hulk of Stalinism, it seems, will not quickly crumble away. State monopolies will keep on stifling trade, \"free\" prices or not, until something else replaces them. Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement, processing and distribution--plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors, pesticides, fertilizers and feed. The Communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here. Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job that Solidarity has barely started. But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already: the private farmer. \"We are dealing with real entrepreneurs,\" says Antoni Leopold, an economist who advises Rural Solidarity, the union's countryside offshoot. \"There are a lot of them, and they have property.\" Polish peasants, spurning the collectivizers, were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists. Now, among Communist reformers, they are objects of envy. Food is the reformer's top priority, the key to popular support. As the Chinese have shown and the Soviets are learning, family farms thrive where collectives fail. Ownership, it seems, is the best fertilizer. The Poles have had it all along. Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try. A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms. Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz owns 30 acres in 14 scattered scraps. He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens, five cows and 25 piglets. In patched pants and torn shoes, he stands in his barnyard eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic. \"It's bad soil,\" he says. Until 1963, it was good soil. Then the state put in a reservoir to supply the area with drinking water. Farmers lay down before the bulldozers. Their protest was ignored. The dam caused the water level to drop in Zalubice. Mr Pyszkiewicz smiles and his brow furrows. He expected as much. In his lifetime, 47 years, the Communists brought electricity to his village and piped in drinking water from the reservoir. No phones. No gas. \"We wanted them to build a road here,\" he says. \"They started, and then abandoned it.\" A tractor, his only mechanized equipment, stands in front of the pigsty. \"It's Russian. Good for nothing. Parts are a tragedy. Even if I had a lot of money, I couldn't buy what I need.\" The farmer can say the same for coal, cement, saw blades. In Poland, only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want; in the West, it is closer to 20%. The few big state farms take first crack at what does get made. They use 60% more fertilizer per acre, twice the high-grade feed. Yet their best boast is that they produce 32% of Polish pork. \"I've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized,\" Mr. Pyszkiewicz says as his wife, Wieslawa, sets some chairs out in the sun. \"We have one near here. There is a lot of waste. A private farmer never wastes anything.\" The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain. A private farmer in Poland is free to buy and sell land, hire help, decide what to grow and how to grow it. He is free to invest in chickens, and to fail for lack of chicken wire. He has plenty of freedom--but no choices. \"I'm on my own land,\" Mr. Pyszkiewicz says. \"I don't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do.\" \"Sometimes,\" says his wife, \"we're happy about that.\" By starving the peasant, the Communists have starved Poland. Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors. Farm income is 15% below the average. The young leave, especially girls who won't milk cows by hand. Some men stay, their best friend a bottle of vodka, but two million acres have gone fallow. Without machines, good farms can't get bigger. So the potato crop, once 47 million tons, is down to 35 million. Meat consumption is at 1979's level, pork production at 1973's, milk output at 1960's. If a food crisis undid the Communists, a food revolution will make Solidarity. The potential is displayed along every road into Warsaw: row upon row of greenhouses, stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners' wealth. Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland, the pickles and sauerkraut sublime, the state monopolies long broken. Grain, milk and meat come next. A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare, although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast. Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale. Solidarity wants it from the West. Maria Stolzman, one of its farm experts, lays it on the line: \"The World Bank will be brought in to help us destroy the old system.\" Felix Siemienas is destroying it now. He packs pork. A law went on the books in January that let him smoke bacon without breeding pigs. He cashed in. Poland is short on enterprises, not enterprise. \"I pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees,\" he says. He is in Warsaw to open a shop. \"I hire transportation, and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day. I don't subsidize anyone. Everyone around me lives well. Yes, my prices are high. If nobody buys, I bring my prices down. That's the rule. That's the market.\" Mr. Siemienas is making a fortune--$10,000 a month, he says. He has bought some trendy Western clothes, and a green Mercedes with an American flag in the window. But the meat-processing machines he picked up are 50 years old. \"I don't want expensive machines. If the situation changes, I'll get stuck with them.\" That's politics. By taking power in a deal with the Peasant Party's onetime Communist stooges, Solidarity has spooked the rural entrepreneur. Rural Solidarity objected, to no avail, when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa accepted the Peasants' support. It objected again in September when Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki reluctantly named a Peasant Party man as his agriculture minister.\nQuestion: Prime Minister of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant, architect William McDonough seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting. He is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts. \"Look how much air is moving around!\" he says. \"The ventilation here is great!\" You may be hearing more about the 38-year-old Mr. McDonough and his preoccupation with clean air. After years of relative obscurity, he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture. Mr. McDonough believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution, tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues, and avoiding mahogany, which comes from endangered rain forests. He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant--\"architecturally impeccable,\" Progressive Architecture magazine called it--and his remodeling of Paul Stuart, the Madison Avenue clothing store. He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space. He is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts. What really stirs his muse, though, is aerobic architecture. Now the question is: Is Poland ready for it? Mr. McDonough is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet, the proposed Warsaw Trade Center in Poland, the first such center in Eastern Europe. The project has already acquired a certain New York cachet. Bloomingdale's plans to sell a foot-tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays. Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS. A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby's in December. If Mr. McDonough's plans get executed, as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum, steel and glass recycled from Warsaw's abundant rubble. A 20-story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space. Solar-powered batteries will make the spire glow. The windows will open. The carpets won't be glued down, and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes. To the extent that the $150 million budget will allow it, Mr. McDonough will rely on solid wood, rather than plywood or particle board, to limit the emission of formaldehyde. If Mr. McDonough has his way, the Poles will compensate for the trade center's emissions of carbon dioxide, a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear. The Poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $150,000, with the center's developer footing the bill. The news hasn't exactly moved others in Mr. McDonough's profession to become architectural Johnny Appleseeds. All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work, says John Burgee, whose New York firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square, \"but we can't all carry it to that extreme.\" Karen Nichols, senior associate at Michael Graves's architecture firm in Princeton, N.J., says: \"We're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily.\" Mr. McDonough responds: \"I'm asking people to broaden their agendas.\" The son of a Seagram's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world, Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights, Ohio, before entering Dartmouth College. He earned a master's degree in architecture from Yale. His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth. He and his father still spend time each summer fly-fishing for salmon in Iceland. Living in Hong Kong, he says, made him sensitive to the limits on food, power and water supplies. At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers. He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont. At Yale, he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in Ireland. Mr. McDonough's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York. The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big, operable windows. Since the 1970s energy crisis, some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect: high indoor pollution. To reduce it at the fund's building, workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director's office. Jute, rather than a synthetic material, lies under the tacked-down carpets, and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic. The budget was only $400,000.\nQuestion: The budget of what?\nAnswer:",

Japanese domestic motor-vehicle sales rose 12% in September, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said earlier this month. The manufacturers' association will issue statistics on vehicle exports later this month. Production of cars rose to 801,835 units in September, a 5.5% increase from a year earlier.

        "inputs": "Context: The neighborhood around Alexander Haagen Co.'s Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center in the Watts section of Los Angeles resembles the crime-ridden, deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly isn't the sort of area one would choose to visit. But turn into the shopping center's parking lot, and one could be in the safe, busy mall of a prosperous suburb. Only it is safer, and busier. Over the past year there have been only one burglary, three thefts of or from autos, no purse-snatchings, and one attempted robbery in the mall, which opened in late 1981. A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would, per year, be expected to have eight burglaries, 70 thefts of or from autos, and four robberies. The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $350 per leasable square foot; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $200. Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are doing almost as well. A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern, in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth, gangs, and the criminal element, with an erosion of the customer base, development capital, and insurability. Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices. Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents. Thus there is even more to the Vermont-Slauson Center than a good place to shop. This defensible commercial zone becomes, for the residents, a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape, evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible. The center improves the community image to outsiders as well, and may help to arrest, or even reverse, the exodus of capital and investment. An additional benefit is the creation of jobs. This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers. It continues through the life of the center; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $2,500 per job. As many of these jobs are filled by local residents, who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls, the $2,500-per-job public investment should repay itself in a few years. And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales, real estate, licenses and the like. Profits are also plowed back into the community; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60% of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community--now running into the hundreds of units--as well as commercial and industrial development projects. Bradford Crowe, director of the mayor's City Economic Development Office, says: \"There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood. What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock, thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont-Slauson yields.\" Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women. In the Grand Boulevard Plaza developed by Matanky Realty Group in Chicago's Third Ward, opposite the Robert Taylor Homes, 29% of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14% to members of other minority groups. Children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins. So what's the catch? Primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time, patience, breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess. Security costs are also quite high. One of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies, local political leaders, and citizen groups, and with prospective tenants and sources of financing. Suburban deals are not without their delays and complications--inner-city deals just have more of them. Security at a typical Haagen inner-city center is impressive, but unobtrusive. The entire site is enclosed by a 6-to-8-foot-high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote-controlled gates. Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance. Infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the entire center; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard.\nQuestion: lighting levels of what?\nAnswer:",

Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out. But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if OPEC doesn't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters. As a result, the effort by some oil ministers to get OPEC to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency. The organization is scheduled to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25. So far this year, rising demand for OPEC oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others. But that could change if demand for OPEC's oil softens seasonally early next year as some think may happen. OPEC is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day, sharply above its nominal, self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million, according to OPEC and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune. At that rate, a majority of OPEC's 13 members have reached their output limits, they said. But it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day--and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day--of spare capacity still exists within OPEC. Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries, including his own, Issam Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, told the conference Friday. He puts OPEC's current capacity at 28 million to 29 million barrels a day. That's higher than some other estimates. Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels a day. Either way, the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge. Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves, such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq, could upset the market. The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market. However, in interviews later, both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member. Under that approach, countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC's production ceiling than they would under the current system. \"If you are already producing at 95% or 100% of your capacity, what's the good to be told you can produce at 105% of capacity?\" asked Mr. Al-Chalabi. At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month, OPEC's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling. They doled it out using the existing formula, however, which meant that even those countries that couldn't produce more received higher official allotments.\nQuestion: the existing formula of what?\nAnswer:",

The group, which has held half a dozen seminars so far, also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers. \"People in this business have been insulated,\" says Josh Pons, a horse breeder from Bel Air, Md. \"But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses.\" At the Laurel race track, the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings, a beer packaging plant worker.

Mihalek, a Lexington attorney and former Kentucky state securities commissioner. \"You have to go into it firmly believing that it's the kind of investment where you can lose everything.\" And many have done just that. Consider Spendthrift Farm, a prominent Lexington horse farm that went public in 1983 but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year. A group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of Spendthrift, hoping to rebuild it. Other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred racehorses or stallion breeding rights. One big problem has been the thoroughbred racehorse market. From 1974 to 1984, prices for the best yearlings at the summer sales rose 918% to an average of $544,681.\nQuestion: the best yearlings of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: Early this century, diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic Ocean was a day at the beach. Men would crawl in the sand looking for shiny stones. It was as easy as collecting sea shells at Malibu. Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes, searching for that unusual glint. But only after a fleet of 336 gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's diamond kingpins, do their work. Last year, 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover 934,242 carats, which comes to 46 tons of sand per carat, or one-fifth gram. Oh yes, the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards. \"If there's diamonds out there, we'll get to them,\" says Les Johns, De Beers's engineering manager. Here, wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world's most inhospitable diamond dig, lies the earth's most precious jewel box. Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature--first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa's interior, then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert--98% of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality. While other mines might yield more carats, a higher percentage of them go to industrial use. Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault, it has been turned into one. Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert--about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic--a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations. When the Germans lost World War I, they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers. Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers's stingy approval. The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa. Ghost towns dot the Namib dunes, proving diamonds aren't forever. Oranjemund, the mine headquarters, is a lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents. Jackals roam the streets at night, and gemsbok, hardy antelope with long straight horns, wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers. On most days, the desert's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag. The wind, stinging with sand, never seems to stop. Still, miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers's head offices in South Africa and London keep coming. And Oranjemund boasts attractions besides diamonds. There are six video rental shops, three restaurants, one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling. The pride of Oranjemund is the 18-hole golf course--with the largest sand trap in the world. Last year, when the rising Orange River threatened to swamp the course, the same engineers who are pushing back the Atlantic rushed to build a wall to hold back the flood. \"Nothing is too good for our golf course,\" says Tony George, a mining engineer. Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government following next month's elections freeing the country from South African control, De Beers engineers are working to extend the mine's productive life for another 25 years, from the current estimate of 10.\nQuestion: the current estimate of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: This city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last week's earthquake. Estimates of damage in the six-county San Francisco Bay area neared $5 billion, excluding the cost of repairing the region's transportation system. The Bay Bridge, the main artery into San Francisco from the east, will be closed for at least several weeks. Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. The bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day. Also, most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south, the 101 freeway, have been closed for repairs. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which runs subway trains beneath the bay, is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000. BART has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for the onslaught. Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the East Bay towns of Oakland and Berkeley. For the first time in 32 years, ferry service has been restored between the East Bay and San Francisco. The Red and White Fleet, which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County, and tourist tours of the bay, is offering East Bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $10 round-trip. That tariff is too stiff for some Financial District wage earners. \"I'll stay with BART,\" said one secretary, swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube. Officials expect the Golden Gate Bridge to be swamped with an extra load of commuters, including East Bay residents making a long detour. \"We're anticipating quite a traffic crunch,\" said one official. About 23,000 people typically travel over the Golden Gate Bridge during commute hours. About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period. Meetings canceled by Apple Computer Inc.'s European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants. It also raised hackles of the city's tourism boosters. \"Other cities are calling -LCB- groups booked here for tours and conferences -RCB- and--not to be crass--stealing our booking list,\" said Scott Shafer, a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos. City officials stuck by their estimate of $2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city. The other five Bay area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $2.8 billion. All estimates exclude highway repair, which could exceed $1 billion. Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in San Francisco that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage. The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the Embarcadero Freeway. Until it was closed Tuesday, it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the Financial District. Engineers say it will take at least eight months to repair the Embarcadero structure. As part of the quake recovery effort, the city Building Department has surveyed about 3,000 buildings, including all of the Financial District's high-rises. The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that \"we were incredibly lucky,\" said Lawrence Kornfield, San Francisco's chief building inspector. While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage, little of that involved major structural damage. City building codes require construction that can resist temblors. In England, Martin Leach, a spokesman for Lloyd's of London, said the insurance market hasn't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster. \"The extent of the claims won't be known for some time,\" Mr. Leach said. On Friday, during a visit to California to survey quake damage, President Bush promised to \"meet the federal government's obligation\" to assist relief efforts. California officials plan to ask Congress for $3 billion or more of federal aid, in the form of grants and low-interest loans. The state has a $1 billion reserve, and is expected to add $1 billion to that fund in the next year. Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid, but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief. However, state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum.\nQuestion: a statewide referendum of what?\nAnswer:",

Some scenes:--Saturday morning, a resident was given 15 minutes to scurry into a sagging building and reclaim what she could of her life's possessions. Saturday night she dined in an emergency shelter on salmon steaks prepared by chefs from one of the city's four-star restaurants.--Mayor Art Agnos stands in the glare of television lights trying to explain for the 20th time why the city is severely restricting access to badly damaged structures. A couple in fashionable spandex warm-up suits jogs by, headphones jauntily in place, weaving their way along a street of fractured and fallen houses. At a nearby corner, they swerve perilously close to a listing apartment house, oblivious to any danger. A policeman shakes his head in amazement as he steers them away.--A young woman who has been out of town shows up at the Marina Middle School to learn that her apartment is on the condemned list. She is told she can't enter unless she is accompanied by an inspector. She bursts into tears and walks away. Nearby, five temporary residents of the school shelter sit on stools, having their necks and backs kneaded by volunteer masseuses. The Marina rescue center offered a very San Franciscan response to the disaster. In addition to free massages, there was free counseling, phone calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club, which offered up its showers, saunas and hot tubs. The cafeteria offered donated croissants and brie for breakfast, and for dinner, pasta salad and chocolate mousse torts along with the salmon. \"This has been a 15-pound earthquake for me,\" said resident Joan O'Shea, who works in an acupuncturist's office. She and some friends are considering offering earthquake victims free yoga classes and \"aroma therapy\"--massages with scented oils. She finds the response of Marina residents--primarily yuppies and elderly people--to the devastation of their homes \"incredible. People have been very respectful of each other. I don't know if this would have happened somewhere else.\" Out on the streets, some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions. \"It's so weird to have to decide what's really important to you,\" said Barbara May. She went first for personal mementos. In post-earthquake parlance, her building is a \"red.\" After being inspected, buildings with substantial damage were color-coded. Green allowed residents to re-enter; yellow allowed limited access; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes. Reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness. Some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases, others threw goods out windows. It didn't help that on Saturday, after three days of sunshine, it rained. \"The guys are going for their skis, their stereos, their personal computers,\" said Frank Fitzgerald, who helped others empty their apartments. \"The women wanted photo albums, a certain brooch, kind of sentimental things.\" He showed an unbroken, still-ticking pocket watch that he retrieved for one woman. It belonged to her grandfather. Some residents defied orders and returned to \"red\" buildings to retrieve goods. One building was upgraded to red status while people were taking things out, and a resident who wasn't allowed to go back inside called up the stairs to his girlfriend, telling her to keep sending things down to the lobby. A policewoman had to be called in to make her leave; the policewoman helped carry out one last load.\nQuestion: one last load of what?\nAnswer:",

The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, a Lexington, Ky.-based trade group, has launched \"seminars\" for \"potential investors\" at race tracks around the country. The group, which has held half a dozen seminars so far, also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers. \"People in this business have been insulated,\" says Josh Pons, a horse breeder from Bel Air, Md. \"But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses.\" At the Laurel race track, the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings, a beer packaging plant worker. Right now, Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program, cheering for Karnak on the Nile, a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch. Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13, and he is using the money to help buy a 45-acre horse farm. \"Just imagine how exciting that would be if that's your horse,\" he says.

But that's for the best horses, with most selling for much less--as little as $100 for some pedestrian thoroughbreds. Even while they move outside their traditional tony circle, racehorse owners still try to capitalize on the elan of the sport. Glossy brochures circulated at racetracks gush about the limelight of the winner's circle and high-society schmoozing. One handout promises: \"Pedigrees, parties, post times, parimutuels and pageantry.\" \"It's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves,\" says Headley Bell, a fifth-generation horse breeder from Lexington. Maybe it's not that simple. For starters, racehorse buyers have to remember the basic problem of such ventures: These beasts don't come with warranties. And for every champion, there are plenty of nags. Katherine Voss, a veteran trainer at the Laurel, Md., track, offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn, noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses.

If that money were being taxed, it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen. In 1984, an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions. Then, in 1988, a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament. The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin: North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral. In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members. The magazine alleged that in making the donations, the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren. The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report. And at first, neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue. But the press kept it alive; as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people who had received money. Within a matter of weeks, less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations. So far, though, there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members received amounted to bribes. Then the two camps upped the ante: Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members. The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization, and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ($880,000) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen. On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry, including 450,000 yen ($3,175) by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal. Direct donations from either of the residents' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign, but both groups deny making direct donations.\nQuestion: Direct donations of what?\nAnswer:",

After years of relative obscurity, he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture. Mr. McDonough believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution, tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues, and avoiding mahogany, which comes from endangered rain forests.

        "inputs": "Context: Maggie Thatcher must be doing something right; her political enemies are screaming louder than ever. Mrs. Thatcher, who was practicing the read-my-lips school of politics years before Mr. Bush encountered it, has made clear her opposition to refashioning Britain's free-market policies to suit the bureaucrats in Brussels. In return, Mrs. Thatcher is excoriated from Fleet Street to Paris as an obstructionist. Well, it now turns out that Mrs. Thatcher had to travel across the globe to the 49-member Commonwealth summit in Kuala Lumpur to discomfit the Holy Order of Consensus Builders. \"A disastrous farce in Malaysia,\" screamed the Manchester Guardian. \"She can no longer be trusted to behave in a civilised--that is unflaky--fashion when abroad.\" Egad. Canada's Brian Mulroney and Australia's Bob Hawke, the paper said, were \"enraged.\" The London Times said she had \"contravened protocol.\" As usual, her sin was saying what she thought. She issued a separate statement, separating herself from a Commonwealth document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against South Africa. While supporting the Commonwealth \"in utterly condemning apartheid,\" her statement urged it to \"encourage change\" rather than inflict further punishment on the country's black population. Actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions: In May a Gallup Poll found that most South African blacks, 85%, oppose economic sanctions. Still, Mrs. Thatcher had once again gone against the grain. Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sniffed, \"If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot, you are out of step.\"\nQuestion: step of what?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Context: If bluebloods won't pay high prices for racehorses anymore, who will? Breeders are betting on the common folk. The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, a Lexington, Ky.-based trade group, has launched \"seminars\" for \"potential investors\" at race tracks around the country. The group, which has held half a dozen seminars so far, also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers. \"People in this business have been insulated,\" says Josh Pons, a horse breeder from Bel Air, Md. \"But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses.\" At the Laurel race track, the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings, a beer packaging plant worker. Right now, Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program, cheering for Karnak on the Nile, a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch. Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13, and he is using the money to help buy a 45-acre horse farm. \"Just imagine how exciting that would be if that's your horse,\" he says. But experts caution that this isn't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet. \"It's a big-risk business,\" warns Charles C. Mihalek, a Lexington attorney and former Kentucky state securities commissioner. \"You have to go into it firmly believing that it's the kind of investment where you can lose everything.\" And many have done just that. Consider Spendthrift Farm, a prominent Lexington horse farm that went public in 1983 but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year. A group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of Spendthrift, hoping to rebuild it. Other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred racehorses or stallion breeding rights. One big problem has been the thoroughbred racehorse market. From 1974 to 1984, prices for the best yearlings at the summer sales rose 918% to an average of $544,681. Since then, prices have slumped, to an average of $395,374 this summer. But that's for the best horses, with most selling for much less--as little as $100 for some pedestrian thoroughbreds. Even while they move outside their traditional tony circle, racehorse owners still try to capitalize on the elan of the sport. Glossy brochures circulated at racetracks gush about the limelight of the winner's circle and high-society schmoozing. One handout promises: \"Pedigrees, parties, post times, parimutuels and pageantry.\" \"It's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves,\" says Headley Bell, a fifth-generation horse breeder from Lexington. Maybe it's not that simple. For starters, racehorse buyers have to remember the basic problem of such ventures: These beasts don't come with warranties. And for every champion, there are plenty of nags. Katherine Voss, a veteran trainer at the Laurel, Md., track, offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn, noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses. One brown two-year-old filly was wheezing from a cold, while another had splints on its legs, keeping both animals from the racetrack. \"You can see the highs and lows of the business all under one roof,\" she tells the group. \"There aren't too many winners.\" Perhaps the biggest hurdle owners face is convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business. Some badly managed partnerships have burned investors, sometimes after they received advice from industry \"consultants.\" So owners have developed a \"code of ethics,\" outlining rules for consultants and agents, and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest. But some are skeptical of the code's effectiveness. \"The industry is based on individual honesty,\" says Cap Hershey, a Lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought Spendthrift. Despite the drop in prices for thoroughbreds, owning one still isn't cheap. At the low end, investors can spend $15,000 or more to own a racehorse in partnership with others.\nQuestion: investors of what?\nAnswer:",
