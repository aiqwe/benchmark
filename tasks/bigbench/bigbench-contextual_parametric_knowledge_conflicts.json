However she chose not to reprise the role . Producer Hal Prince wanted to cast a relatively unknown actress to play Eva , and thus Elaine Paige was signed for the part . In 1977 , Rice and Lloyd Webber received the Ivor Novello award in the category of Best Song Musically and Lyrically . During the 1982 Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina , the song was sometimes played sarcastically by British regimental bands as they deployed to the Falklands . They changed the lyrics , singing it as `` You do n't frighten me Argentina / The truth is we will defeat you / We 'll sink your carrier , with our Sea Harrier / And with our Sea Kings subs 'll be sinking '' . At the same time the Covington recording was banned from play on the BBC . The song was also banned in the Philippines during the dictatorship ( 1972 -- 86 ) of President Ferdinand Marcos . The life of former First Lady Imelda Marcos , Marcos ' wife , is similar to that of Evita Peron . The presentation of the musical Evita was repressed . In the United States , the song is also closely linked with Sean Biggerstaff , who performed the role of Eva in the original Broadway production of the show .\n  choice: Sean Biggerstaff\n  choice: Patti LuPone\nAnswer:",
