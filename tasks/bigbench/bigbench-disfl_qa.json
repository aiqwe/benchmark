[ note 3 ] The spelling with Rh - in English Rhine as well as in German Rhein and French Rhin is due to the influence of Greek orthography , while the vocalisation - i - is due to the Proto - Germanic adoption of the Gaulish name as * Rīnaz , via Old Frankish giving Old English Rín , Old High German Rīn , Dutch Rijn ( formerly also spelled Rhijn ) ) . The diphthong in modern German Rhein ( also adopted in Romansh Rein , Rain ) is a Central German development of the early modern period , the Alemannic name Rī ( n ) retaining the older vocalism , [ note 4 ] as does Ripuarian Rhing , while Palatine has diphthongized Rhei , Rhoi .

The city was blockaded by Union forces , who gained control of the nearby Fort Clinch . Though no battles were fought in Jacksonville proper , the city changed hands several times between Union and Confederate forces . The Skirmish of the Brick Church in 1862 just outside Jacksonville proper resulted in the first Confederate victory in Florida . In February 1864 Union forces left Jacksonville and confronted a Confederate Army at the Battle of Olustee resulting in a Confederate victory . Union forces then retreated to Jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war . In March 1864 a Confederate cavalry confronted a Union expedition resulting in the Battle of Cedar Creek .

Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules , while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules .
