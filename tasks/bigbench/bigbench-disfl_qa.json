They are divided into four classes ( Type I – IV ) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction . Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction , often associated with allergy . Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death . Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE , which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross - linked by antigen . Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient ' s own cells , marking them for destruction . This is also called antibody - dependent ( or cytotoxic ) hypersensitivity , and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies . Immune complexes ( aggregations of antigens , complement proteins , and IgG and IgM antibodies ) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions . Type IV hypersensitivity ( also known as cell - mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity ) usually takes between two and three days to develop . Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases , but may also involve contact dermatitis ( poison ivy ) . These reactions are mediated by T cells , monocytes , and macrophages . \nAnswer:",

In favorable circumstances , ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day . Only 100 – 150 species have been validated , and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named . The textbook examples are cydippids with egg - shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla ( \" little tentacles \" ) that are covered with colloblasts , sticky cells that capture prey . The phylum has a wide range of body forms , including the flattened , deep - sea platyctenids , in which the adults of most species lack combs , and the coastal beroids , which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large , stiffened cilia that act as teeth . These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area , because they specialize in different types of prey , which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use . \nAnswer:",

The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians . When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues , religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \" popery \" ; the Act maintained French Civil law , including the seigneurial system , a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution . \nAnswer:",

The individual is the final judge of right and wrong . More than this , since only individuals act , only individuals can act unjustly . When the government knocks on the door , it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood . Before Thoreau ’ s imprisonment , when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay , Thoreau had advised , “ Resign . ” If a man chose to be an agent of injustice , then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice . But if government is “ the voice of the people , ” as it is often called , shouldn ’ t that voice be heeded ? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians . Even a good form of government is “ liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it . ” Moreover , even if a government did express the voice of the people , this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said . The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right . What , then , is the proper relationship between the individual and the government ? \nAnswer:",

Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites , which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time . Others are sequential hermaphrodites , in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times . Fertilization is generally external , although platyctenids ' eggs are fertilized inside their parents ' bodies and kept there until they hatch . The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids , gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow . The exceptions are the beroids , whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles , and the platyctenids , whose young live as cydippid - like plankton until they reach near - adult size , but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form .

Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor ( as in the Carnot cycle ) .
