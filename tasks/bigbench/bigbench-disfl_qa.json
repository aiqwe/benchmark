This decreed that it would be occupied by the allies , until 1935 and after that , it would be a demilitarised zone , with the German army forbidden to enter . The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision , in general , caused much resentment in Germany and is often cited as helping Adolf Hitler ' s rise to power . The allies left the Rhineland , in 1930 and the German army re - occupied it in 1936 , which was enormously popular in Germany . Although the allies could probably have prevented the re - occupation , Britain and France were not inclined to do so , a feature of their policy of appeasement to Hitler . \nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Question: What does each packet label include in connectionless mode or rather each packet ?  \ncontext: In connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information . The packets are routed individually , sometimes resulting in different paths and out - of - order delivery . Each packet is labeled with a destination address , source address , and port numbers . It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet . This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination , but means that much more information is needed in the packet header , which is therefore larger , and this information needs to be looked up in power - hungry content - addressable memory . Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes ; potentially , the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection - oriented system has to do in connection set - up , but with less information as to the application ' s requirements . At the destination , the original message / data is reassembled in the correct order , based on the packet sequence number . Thus a virtual connection , also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end - user by a transport layer protocol , although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service . \nAnswer:",

This means that for a closed system , the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system . The force , therefore , is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space , and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area . \nAnswer:",

Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 % to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes . During the acute phase of inflammation , particularly as a result of bacterial infection , neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis , and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection . Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1 . Macrophages also act as scavengers , ridding the body of worn - out cells and other debris , and as antigen - presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system . \nAnswer:",
