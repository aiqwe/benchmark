Which of the following is an explanation of why the councilman’s argument is incorrect?\n  option: Everyone who didn’t wear a seatbelt has been arrested.\n  option: The town’s seatbelt mandate had yet to go into effect.\n  option: Not all cars were equipped with seatbelts.\n  option: All people, both injured and not, are wearing seatbelts.\n  option: People who don’t wear seatbelts don’t report their accidents.\nAnswer:",

Part of Mark’s conviction is based on his expertise in LIDAR technology, which forms an integral part of the computer-vision systems in most self-driving cars.  Immediately after taking the bet, Mark attends a conference displaying the latest research in LIDAR technology, after which Mark tells his friend that he regrets taking the bet.  Which of the following is a reasonable inference?\n  option: Mark invested in a self-driving car company at the LIDAR conference.\n  option: Mark still believes that self-driving cars will not work in this century.\n  option: Mark learned something at the conference suggesting that LIDAR technology would not work.\n  option: Mark did not change his beliefs on the feasibility of self-driving technology at the conference.\n  option: Mark learned something at the conference that gave him more confidence in LIDAR technology.\nAnswer:",
