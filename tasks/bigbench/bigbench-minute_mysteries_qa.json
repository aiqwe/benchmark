        "inputs": "Story: It was one of those nasty March days, full of winter bluster and cold early spring rain, and I was feeling out of sorts. Sherlock Holmes was, as far as I then knew, a victim of his tussle with Professor Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland. (You will note that this was before his reappearance as I, Dr. James Watson, have written elsewhere.) I was sadly going through the papers of his cases, hoping to recapture something of the spirit and excitement of his companionship during our days of working on his cases. Or rather, I should put it more modestly, and just say how thrilled I had been to work alongside Holmes, at his unfailing direction. Mrs. Hudson, the housekeeper at 221B Baker Street, had served me delicious hot tea with scones and jam, and I then settled in to reading some old files. A number of them were not yet chronicled, and perhaps I sought to make Holmes come alive for an hour or so while I wrote notes about a case that he and I had worked on together. That was when a knock on the door interrupted my thoughts, and before Mrs. Hudson could introduce the visitor, I saw a charming, rather breathless young woman, about twenty, fashionably dressed, almost bursting through the door, so hurried was she. “You must help me, Mr. Holmes!” She nearly shouted. I tried to set her right, I really did. But each time I opened my mouth, she began again, cutting off speech with her cries for urgent action. “You must come and help! Even now it might be too late,” she cried. In the end, not knowing what I was doing or where we were going, I grabbed my overcoat and, for the sake of the image, an old deerstalker cap that Holmes had abandoned on a hook near the door, rushed out the door with her, leaving an astonished Mrs. Hudson in our wake. “We’ll go to Euston Station, and I’ll explain everything on the train,” she said. And it was with a sense of relief that, good as her word, as soon as we were on the suburban train line, she took a deep breath, prepared to speak and then looked at me closely for the first time. “Odd, you don’t look anything like Sherlock Holmes,” she sputtered. “That’s because I am not Sherlock Holmes,” I said. “I am Dr. James Watson at your service. Holmes and I have explored many cases together, and in his unfortunate absence (for I was still unwilling, despite the evidence, to admit to myself that Holmes might be dead), I will be glad to assist you in any way that I can.” That seemed to comfort her. “Please begin,” I said. “My name is Sheila Ingalls,” she said. “I am the daughter of the Reverend Martin Ingalls of Camden Parish, our destination today. I thought that today was going to be the happiest day of my life, for the announcement of my engagement to Wallace Anders was to be announced this morning.” “I gather it was not announced?” “No. Imagine my feelings when I arrived at the church, following a short morning walk from the parsonage where my father and I reside, and looking at the bulletin board where announcements of intending marriage are posted, saw that Wallace Anders was not listed as engaged to be married to myself!” She then started to cry and pulled from her handbag an enormous handkerchief, which was soon put to strenuous use. “But that isn’t the end of it!” She said. “No?” “No, indeed!” For looking at the notice more closely, I saw that Wallace Anders was engaged to marry Georgette Pelham instead!” “This seems to be nothing more than clerical error,” I said, trying to calm the young woman. “Surely, there is a logical explanation for this mistake?” “If only it were that simple,” she wistfuly replied. Resisting my attempts to question her further, we rode in grim silence for the short distance of the commute to Camden Station, where we were met by her father, the Reverend Marvin Ingalls. He confirmed her story, and soon we were at the church, where I could see for myself what had been made public. Locked behind glass, the bulletin board displayed just one listing, Georgette Pelham to marry Wallace Anders. “Who makes these listings and posts them?” I asked the Reverend Ingalls. “In the absence of a clerk, I do,” he said. “It doesn’t help that I don’t see all that well. The procedure is that a donation is usually given, and then I open the bulletin board box with a key, pin the notice, and then lock the box once again.” “Does anyone else have another key that opens the notice board?” “No. This is the only one, from my office.” He waggled it like a badge of office, which perhaps in a way it was, in that small parish community. “Come to think of it,” he added, “I have a duplicate key at home, in the parsonage.” “When did all this happen?” “It was late last night. Wallace Anders came to the parish office and asked to post the engagement. He was generous, and so I gave him the notice paper to fill out, which he did.” “Did you look at the paper before posting it?” “Only a glance, for I must confess, my eyes are not what they were.” “But that wasn’t your only caller yesterday?” That was a nice note, I thought. Holmes could hardly have done better himself, in anticipating a line of inquiry. “No. Georgette Pelham also came, half an hour later. She came to see the announcement, she said.” “She didn’t want to make an announcement herself?” “That isn’t possible. Only men are permitted to make the announcements, either the prospective bridegroom, or the father of the bride.” “And you had made no announcement?” “None whatever.” “Was Georgette Pelham emotionally distressed?” “No, she was not upset in the least - she seemed quite happy. And that rather surprised me.” “Why, Reverend Ingalls?” “Well, it has long been known in this little town that she wanted to marry Wallace Anders - most people assumed that they would be married one day.” I turned to Sheila Ingalls. “When did Wallace Anders propose?” “It was one week ago. We were playing whist, and he was in a playful mood. I had just played a very skillful hand, if I do say so myself. He said that anyone who played that well should be his partner for life!” “Really?” “Yes, indeed, and everyone heard it. I assented and told Father immediately, of course. And then I said that Wallace should post the engagement. He was somewhat reluctant, saying that his business wasn’t quite self-sufficient, some nonsense of that sort. And finally, last night he told me that he would be posting the engagement announcement which I could not wait to see this morning. And we have this forgery instead!” “Can you help us, Dr. Watson?” “I believe that I can. You did well, Miss Ingalls, to bring it to my personal attention. For I can tell you not only who posted the announcement, but what was the intention in doing so.” Who forged the engagement?\n  choice: Reverend Marvin Ingalls\n  choice: Wallace Anders\n  choice: Georgette Pelham\n  choice: Sheila Ingalls\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: When Merv Weiss called me in on the Great Candy Cane Caper, I wasn’t exactly striped with enthusiasm. His sons, the Weiss boys, or the Three Weiss Men as they were other wise known in the neighborhood, had a well-earned reputation for being a cantankerous lot. But their father was an old friend, and I’d shopped at his hardware store for over forty years. So, I put my other cases on hold for a day, while I looked into the theft of Merv’s giant candy cane. “Hello, Ronald,” I said, as I pushed through the front doors of the store. “Uh-huh,” the oldest of Merv’s three sons grumbled in reply. Ronald was manager of the Outdoors department, and presently he was having one heck of a time lifting an elf garden gnome off the floor. His over-ample stomach kept getting in the way, his woefully thin arms trembling with the effort of hefting the cast-concrete weight. “Let me give you a hand with that,” I volunteered. Ronald heaved to his feet and watched as I easily scooped up the fifty-pound elf and deposited him in a nearby wheelbarrow for safe and easy transport. The man grunted something like thanks, and then trundled off in the direction of his department with his cargo. “Don’t tell me my father hired you to ‘investigate’ the disappearance of that stupid candy cane of his?” That was Michael Weiss, youngest of the Three Weiss Men. He came limping up to me with a look as unfriendly as his brother’s. “Yes,” I replied, “I’m-” “What a waste of money!” the man exclaimed, throwing up his hands. “If he’d let me light up the outside of the store like I’d asked, we wouldn’t have this problem.” Michael was in charge of the store’s Electrical department – lights, fixtures and all things conductive wire-related. He was just as tall as Ronald, but much thinner. “You wanted to string some Christmas lights?” I said. He snorted. “I could’ve made this place brighter than the North Star! But Dad insisted on blowing the Christmas promotional budget on a twenty-foot-long candy cane.” “Okay, that’ll be enough, son.” That was my old friend, Merv, emerged from his office to greet me. Michael tossed his hands into the air in another display of exasperation and limped off down an aisle towards his department. “Is his leg still bothering him, Merv?” I asked. “Yes, it hasn’t fully healed since he got tangled up in that spool of wire a month ago and pulled a hamstring.” I glanced out the door, just as Merv’s third son, Frank, drove up and parked at the curb in front of the store. “Frank’s got a new car, I see.” Merv looked that way, and nodded. “Yes, a hybrid. It is environmentally friendly. How he fits all of his family in there, I have no idea.” The father of six managed the store’s Power Tools department. He nodded curtly at his dad and me as he came through the doors, then walked off in the direction of his section of the store. “Let’s go into my office,” Merv said. “I’ve got something to show you.” Merv’s office was little more than a cubbyhole, jammed full of stuff like his store was. A computer monitor sat on a pile of papers on his desk, and he directed my attention to the screen. “This is the surveillance video from last night – when the candy cane was stolen. I only have the one camera at the front of the store.” He shrugged his shoulders. “It’s all I can afford. And besides, this is still a pretty good neighborhood.” We stared at a black and white picture of the dimmed store interior, long after closing time. A huge candy cane was clearly visible at the front of the store, lying on its side, elevated at the curly end, like some giant Christmas bandy stick. “Kids loved it,” Merv said, shrugging again. “I was going to have a drawing for it on Christmas Eve.” Everything appeared calm and quiet in the store, like the night before Xmas. Until, suddenly, a man strode briskly into camera range – a man dressed in a Santa suit, complete with furry cap, black boots, white beard and overstuffed stomach. “Clever disguise,” I commented. “There’s no way to make out his face or true physique in that costume.” Merv nodded, as the not-so-jolly Saint Nick shoved the curly end of the giant cane off its platform and onto the floor. He then picked up the kids’ candy dream by its curl and dragged it off out of the picture. “That’s it?” “That’s it,” Merv said. “Not much to go on, is it?” Brent Pearson stuck his head into the office. “Okay if I order those sinks we were talking about, Merv?” Brent was in charge of the Plumbing department. That, and the fact he was younger and a half-inch shorter than the Three Weiss Men, led them to call him ‘the little plumber boy’. “Sure,” Merv replied. “Great. I’ll drive over and pick them up in my van later today.” “Want a mint?” I said, pulling a roll out of my pocket and offering one to Brent. “No, thanks. I’m diabetic, remember?” “Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.” Brent went about his business and Merv and I walked to the back of the store, out onto the loading dock. “That thieving Claus must have dragged my candy cane out here, loaded it into something big enough to haul a twenty-foot, hundred-pound treat away,” Merv commented. “I’m guessing Father Christmas didn’t come down the chimney. So how’d he get in?” Merv looked down. “That’s the thing. The store was locked up tight, and there is no sign of a forced entry.” I whistled. “So, it is an inside job.” Merv nodded disconsolately. “That’s why I haven’t called in the police. All of my boys and Brent have keys to the store, and individual keys to their own departments. They shutter off their sections of the store at the end of the day and lock them, and then I lock the store itself.” I mulled that over, staring down at the cement-loading platform myself. I noticed something, and kneeled down, ran a wetted fingertip over a thin line of red and white shavings, tasted them. “Sweet.” I stood up and looked at Merv. “Well, old friend, I know who played bad Santa – took, instead of gave. And I know how he got away with the candy cane, too. It wasn’t with the help of eight tiny reindeer.” Who stole the candy cane?\nAnswer:",
        "targets": [
            "“Who? How?” Merv asked, astonished that I could wrap up the case so quickly.\n\n“Your son, Frank,” I stated bluntly. “As the man with the power tools, he simply power-sawed the giant candy cane into manageable pieces and then stacked them in his car and drove away. There’re still a few shavings around that he missed in his clean-up.”\n\n“But any one of the four could have done that, couldn’t they? How do you know for sure it was Frank?”\n\n“Simple. The man on the surveillance tape walked into camera range; he didn’t limp. That lets Michael off the hook. And there’s no way Ronald could’ve dragged that heavy candy cane around like the man in the video. He just doesn’t have the strength. So, he’s innocent. And Brent Pearson is diabetic. He’s got about as much use for a hundred pounds of cane sugar as Santa has for another plate of cookies.”\n\nMerv nodded, convinced. “But why did Frank do it?”\n\nIt was my turn to shrug. “I guess six kids can put an awful strain on a family’s candy budget this time of year.”"

        "inputs": "Story: \"Ghosts,\" said Dillon, sadly. \"A thief!\" I replied. \"Why would you think it was ghosts who stole your saxophone?\" \"It started 30 years ago,\" Dillon sighed. \"There were four of us, then, playing an alto sax and a baritone, plus a low 'contrabass' and a high 'soprano'.\" His eyes were lost in memory, and he smiled happily. \"Our band had a sound like no other. We were this city's biggest saxophone quartet!\" Dillon walked to a tall bookcase, which was stuffed with vinyl records, and ran a tired finger along their edges. He settled on worn-out cover, and soon the needle on his phonograph had found the record's groove. His tiny room filled with 30-year-old music, fast saxophones rollicking while a bass and a drum kept the beat. \"I didn't know it then,\" Dillon explained, \"but my saxophone also had its own legend.\" The quartet's producer had been a notorious music promoter named Shorty Jenkins. \"Rumor had it Shorty created the careers of some famous musicians -- but then later, destroyed them!\" After twenty years of working the music business, Shorty had the right connections to help acts succeed. But was he also a powerful enemy? \"We did whatever Shorty said,\" Dillon laughed. \"And we did it happily. He picked our songs, wrote our arrangements, and he even lined up the other saxophonists. Within four weeks, somehow Shorty had gotten our record into the stores.\" But then reading a newspaper, Dillon had spotted a disturbing article. \"Shorty was bragging that he'd used the instruments of dead musicians for his new saxophone quartet. Without telling us, he'd given us each the saxophone of a famous jazz artist he'd worked with decades before. Dark whispers spread throughout the clubs. Were we exploiting the artists who came before - or preserving what made them special?\" Dillon stared thoughtfully for a moment. \"That Christmas, our alto saxophonist got real sick. And within two weeks, the baritone saxophonist disappeared. We couldn't continue with just two of us, but Shorty promised he'd find the group a replacement. We found out later he was stuck in a big legal fight with a trumpeter he'd discovered years before. Eventually our third saxophonist found another gig instead. And I never heard from any of them again.\" The vinyl record reached the end of its last song, circling through the static in its final groove until Dillon lifted the needed. \"But now, even my saxophone's gone.\" I'd known about Dillon for years -- he was a local legend in our neighborhood, though his glory days had passed. I'd only met him recently, so I was honored that he requested my help. But I had to know one thing first. \"Do you really think ghosts stole your saxophone?\" \"I've played it every afternoon for the last 30 years, riffing and improvising, while imagining that our band might somehow get back together. And every day, for 30 years, I've left it on that saxophone stand.\" He pointed to empty clasps which had always held his instrument. \"Today an hour after I finished, it was gone.\" Could someone have broken into his apartment? \"The window was closed,\" Dillon insisted, \"and my only door was locked! I live on the second floor, high above the street.\" Did anyone have a key? \"Well, obviously the manager of this apartment building has a key, but we never see him around. But you know who else has a key? The boy at the grocery store on the corner,\" Dillon said casually. \"Every Friday he brings around my groceries, so I don't have to visit his store.\" I got his name, but also took a look at Dillon's window. It was covered with dirt, but the window lifted easily, and opened onto a fire escape. But the fire escape stopped on the second floor, its ladder to the street broken off many years before. It seemed impossible, but I asked Dillon one more question. Had he spoken to anyone before the saxophone disappeared? \"That morning I gave an interview,\" Dillon said proudly. \"A college student was recording the history of music in this neighborhood, and he'd wanted to get my story.\" Dillon gave me his number, and I began my investigation. The grocery store was easy to find, with its stands of fruit on the sidewalk and a busy father/son team who were putting customer orders in bags. It was the son who was Dillon's delivery boy -- a skinny teenager named Lenny. He was struggling to put six tomatoes into a sack. I asked Lenny if he delivered groceries to Dillon. \"Yeah, but mostly because I feel sorry for him,\" he said, weighing the sack of tomatoes on a scale. \"After thirty years, that man has nothing.\" I pointed out Dillon had a valuable antique saxophone. \"A saxophone's nothing in this neighborhood,\" Lenny laughed. \"We haven't had a club with live music here for years.\" As he stacked bundles of carrots into a tall pile, Lenny asked his father if just this once he could take a break, but his father sternly shouted back the family motto -- \"Work all day with no breaks ever!\" It seemed sad that the music scene was dying, so I was even more determined to find the legendary saxophone. I placed a phone call to a college student named Eric, who'd phoned Dillon that morning. \"It's certainly a valuable saxophone,\" his eager voice insisted, \"more valuable than most people know!\" I asked him what he meant. \"Those four saxophones really did come from famous jazz men,\" he said with excitement. \"The group's producer, Shorty Jenkins had worked with the greatest musicians of the century. There are historic photographs of the quartet's saxophones that prove it. And now the instruments are ten times more valuable than they were 30 years ago, at least $30,000 apiece! Every morning while he played, Dillon had no idea how wealthy he could've been.\" \"I began thinking about the legend after visiting a local music store called Red's,\" Eric continued with excitement. \"Red knows the history of the neighborhood. He's the one who had given me Dillon's phone number so I could do the interview!\" I wondered if Eric's visit had inadvertently tipped off a saxophone thief. Or if maybe the greedy thief could be Eric himself. Red's seemed like a likely place to investigate. He spoke in a voice that was mellow and relaxed, remembering the talented saxophone quartet and the neighborhood's glory days. \"Now I give music lessons from noon to five,\" he laughed jovially. \"But music is music!\" Red remembered Eric's visit. \"An excitable young kid, that's for sure,\" he laughed, \"but he's right about Dillon's saxophones. There are collectors who'd be willing to pay a lot of money for them.\" Was anyone in the store during Eric's visit? \"There was one customer, but he didn't buy anything. Oldest guy I've ever seen. No hair, bristly moustache, about five feet tall.\" Who was he? \"He owns a lot of buildings in this neighborhood, but he almost never comes around.\" I had one last theory. Back at Dillon's place, I asked the residents about the fire escape. They all agreed that it hadn't worked in years, and couldn't even be lowered to the ground. I searched the ground below the fire escape - a patch of dirt which now contained a small flower bed. It was clear that no one had dropped here from the fire escape, or placed a ladder here to climb up. Had they asked their building manager to repair the fire escape? No one had ever seen him. He holed himself up in his fancy apartment, presumably counting all the money that they'd paid him for rent. After reviewing all the clues, I knocked on Dillon's door, and told him the news. \"Ghosts didn't steal your saxophone. But I know who did.\" Who stole the saxophone?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: Eleanor Hall would soon be 97 years old. Her body was failing but with the assistance of her beloved grandson Nick and his wife Nance, she was able to live in the house she and her late husband Harry had purchased in 1946, shortly after the war ended. Eleanor pondered this one morning while sipping her morning coffee. Sadly, the neighborhood had deteriorated in the last few years. Not too long ago, it was well maintained and the neighbors quiet and friendly. But, in the last dozen years or so, Eleanor had seen the last of her old friends pass away and a new criminal element move in. Now, drug abuse and other crime, mostly thievery, had made the street she lived on unsafe. This was especially true for a 96-year old widow, but Nick had been unable to convince her to move into a retirement center. “No,” she would reply, forcefully, whenever Nick and Nance broached the subject, “this has been my home for 64 years and will be until the day I die.” Sadly, her death was coming soon. Unknown to anyone besides herself and Doctor Murphy, she had terminal stomach cancer and had only a few weeks to live. The state of the neighborhood and her health were not the only things on her mind this morning. Last night, the same thief in the night who had stolen into her home several times in recent weeks struck again, this time taking the $20.00 bill Eleanor had left for him to find on the living room coffee table. Eleanor had heard her unwanted intruder and the digital alarm clock on her nightstand told her it was 3:22 a.m. when he opened the unlocked front door a bit too noisily. The thief was not overly greedy and was careful not to disturb Eleanor, but she had studied him quietly more than once and noticed he was not a large man but he did carry a knife and gun. The thick-soled boots he wore made him appear taller than he was. She also noticed that he always wore a ski mask so it was impossible to identify who the thief was and that was the way things would stay, for Eleanor certainly did not plan on introducing herself to him in the wee hours of the morning when he would break in to her home. It would not do for a terminally ill 96-year old woman to challenge him. Eleanor smiled to herself and chuckled bitterly. The thief, whoever he was, did not know whom he was dealing with. In her youth, Eleanor had traveled with a depression era gang of bank robbers. Her boyfriend had been killed in a shootout with J. Edgar Hoover’s G-Men and she had served several years in a Federal prison. Eleanor knew no fear and was no stranger to violence, but luckily for this punk who kept robbing her, she was far past her physical prime. As far as she could tell, the robber was one of four boys who lived nearby and whom, she knew, would be familiar with her house and personal habits. As she emptied her coffee cup, the contents of which did not sit well on her diseased stomach, Eleanor pondered the four boys seriously for the first time Todd Summers was the most violent and dangerous of the four. Todd had been in prison for armed robbery and assault. He was out on parole and considered by the local police to be very dangerous, for Todd, as Eleanor in her youth, knew no fear and enjoyed confrontation. Jon Shaw was dangerous only because he was feeble-minded and stupid. Jon looked up to the other tough guys in the neighborhood and had become their lackey. Jon was neither bright nor mean enough to commit serious crime, but he had been in and out of the local jail various times for minor offenses. Eleanor’s friend on the local police force, Sgt. Rick Daniel, often laughed and commented that, “the Shaw kid gets into trouble when he’s with his pals. He’s not smart enough to get into trouble on his own.” Next, Eleanor considered Max Reinke. She frowned as she considered what Max had given up. Max was well over six feet in height, a star basketball player on the local high school team and was headed to the state university on scholarship before he started getting into trouble. The word from her friend Sgt. Daniel was that his problems began when he developed a fondness for alcohol. Last on Eleanor’s suspect list was Zac Coulson. Eleanor knew Zac’s mother and was aware of how broken-hearted she was on her son becoming a thug and overall ne’er-do well. Zac was very rude to all who knew him and a bully to boot. He was always picking on younger, smaller boys and teasing little girls. Eleanor smiled as she remembered the day Marty Clayton caught up with him in her front yard. Marty’s sister had come running home in tears, claiming it was Zac who had tormented her. Marty found him and bloodied his nose. Like most bullies, Zac could not take what he could dish out to persons weaker than himself. He screamed and ran away from Marty before more blows were delivered. The feisty Eleanor had invited Marty in for a cool drink and they had been friends ever since. Eleanor lit a cigarette. It won’t kill me, she thought, stomach cancer is taking care of that. But, after thinking this through, I think I know who my robber is. I’ll be ready for him next time and I’ll know for sure. Grimly, she thought, I have nothing to lose. If he hurts me, I’m not long for this world anyway. I’ve had almost 97 very full years. The strong-willed Eleanor was determined not to die before the thief in the night was dealt with. Eleanor had to wait a couple of weeks, but the thief finally returned, entering as usual through the unlocked front door. Eleanor, whose clock read 2:50 a.m. when he heard the soft sounds of the familiar intruder in the living room, was ready for him. As he stooped to take the now usual $20.00 from the living room coffee table, Eleanor thought bitterly of the tacit arrangement she had made with this two bit amateur hood. She stepped into the room and aimed a pistol into his masked, startled face. Taking care not to get too close, she said, evenly, “I’m tired of paying you not to hurt me. This ends tonight.” The thief was shocked and scared. The thief, raising his hands, said pleadingly, “Don’t shoot me!” Eleanor had a keen suspicion regarding the thief’s identity. Evenly, she said, “Take off your mask. I want to see you before Sgt. Daniel arrives, which should be shortly as I speed dialed him before leaving my bedroom!” The thief removed his mask. Eleanor, still being very careful with her startled, unwanted guest, said simply, “I thought so!” It was barely two minutes before Sgt. Rick Daniel was standing in the small living room of Eleanor’s home. As he handcuffed the thief, he asked Eleanor if she was OK. “Oh, for heaven’s sake, yes!” was her reply. Rick Daniel chuckled, as he was aware of his elderly friend’s past. He asked, “Did you know who he was before he took his mask off?” “I was pretty certain,” was her answer. Rick smiled and asked her to explain. Who is the thief?\n  choice: Max Reinke\n  choice: Zac Coulson\n  choice: Jon Shaw\n  choice: Todd Summers\nAnswer:",

All others in the Kairns household slept late that day, so they would say, and did not notice Melody’s absence from the kitchen until Nancy, the last person to arise, voiced her concern. It fell to Vernon, Melody’s husband of twenty-four years, to return to the bedroom and check on his wife. He found Melody, a handsome woman of forty-four years, dead and mostly unmarked.

She looked like she was peacefully asleep, which Vernon considered was quite unlike her, as she was usually a noisy, restless sleeper. Vernon, before allowing himself to go into panic, felt her cold wrist. There was no pulse—it was evident she had been dead for several hours. The coroner would later say that she had been dead for approximately seven hours, placing the murder at sometime around two in the morning. Mercifully, the murder weapon, later discovered to be an ice pick, missing from the kitchen, killed her quickly. There was no blood on Melody’s body or bed sheets. But the case stumped the family and police. Several weeks passed, and spring gave way to a hot summer. Vernon invited his sister-in-law Constance, a widow who lived in Texas, to visit for the first time since her sister had been murdered. Constance had been vacationing, staying with the Kairns family, the week that her sister died. She was nearly inconsolable, and Vernon sent her home soon after Melody’s funeral. Constance had little use for Vernon, whom she suspected of womanizing and felt didn’t apply himself to his career and family as he should, but she appreciated the chance to see her niece and nephew again, her last connections to her sister. She and Melody had been close when they were children, even with a seven-year age difference. They had shared a bedroom in their family’s small, east Texas farmhouse when growing up, and also shared all of their hopes, dreams and secrets. Constance recalled those days with fondness but did not entirely miss them, for Melody suffered lifelong sinus trouble and snored loudly, making sound sleep impossible for her until the day she was murdered. That Constance had extremely sensitive hearing only made matters worse, as she, too, experienced lifelong sleeping problems. Still, they had been more than sisters; they were soul mates. Melody’s death had been extremely hard on her. The morning she arrived, just after breakfast, Vernon gathered all of the family into the spacious den. It was the first time since that horrible day they had all been together in one room. After a few minutes of awkward small talk, Vernon cleared his throat and stated, “One of us murdered Melody.” He could barely utter the words and hated what the children must be thinking and going through. But, the police were stumped by the case, and it was apparent that they would get nowhere in the investigation unless one of the family remembered a detail about the night they’d previously forgotten. Vernon explained that the police had encouraged him to bring them together to talk about Melody’s murder again, with Constance present this time. He was not really confident any of them would remember something previously overlooked, but wanted to give it a try. He then asked, “Did anyone see or hear anything out of the ordinary the night she died?” The Kairns house was a big two story and well insulated. Sound did not carry well in it and Vernon was not surprised when nobody replied in the affirmative. John said, “I came home around midnight; I had been out with friends. All the lights were out and I assumed everyone was in bed. I went to the den and watched TV. It must have been three or so before I went upstairs to bed.” Nancy offered, “I was on the phone in my room, with the door closed. Beth and I didn’t quit talking until two-thirty or so.” Nancy gave her father a guilty look, as she knew he disapproved of her late night calls with her talkative best friend Beth Jameson. Vernon then turned to Constance. Barely hiding his animosity, he asked, “And what about you?” Constance smiled thinly, and answered, “I went to bed before midnight and didn’t see or talk to anyone again until next morning. She paused, and then said to John, “I thought about coming downstairs to watch television with you, but I could tell that you were watching one of those Friday the 13th-type movies. You all know how I hate violence with guns and knives.” Turning to Vernon, she said, “I didn’t hear anything from your room all night long.” Constance and Vernon looked at each other. Icily, she asked, “So what about you?” Vernon replied, “I went to bed at eleven-thirty. I vaguely recall hearing John come in downstairs as I was drifting off to a deep sleep. That’s the last thing I remember before awaking the next morning.” He shook, and his voice cracked when saying, “I didn’t notice anything wrong when I got up. I’m always groggy before morning coffee.” Nancy asked her father, “You don’t really believe John or I killed Mom, do you? She nervously glanced at Constance and said, “Sorry. I didn’t mean to imply you killed Mom.” Nancy’s cheeks were rosy red from embarrassment. Constance answered, softly, “Don’t worry about it, dear. I know what you are going through.” Vernon appreciated his sister-in-law’s gentling handling of his troubled daughter, but that did not stop him from saying, “You are the only one who cannot account for your presence during the window of time Melody … left us.” He could not bring himself to use the word “murder” again. Constance thought a long moment, sadness washing over her as she looked at Vernon and Melody’s sweet children. Before speaking, she silently cursed, “Oh, how I hate it’s come to this!” But then she spoke, saying to all of them, “No, I cannot account for my time. I don’t have to because it doesn’t make any difference. The game is up.” Who is the murderer?\n  choice: John\n  choice: Vernon\n  choice: Constance\n  choice: Nancy\nAnswer:",

He was accused of sending the following note found in the murdered man’s pocket: <blockquote> <i>sir john when i last seen you i sed i will kill you if the muney ain’t here by mundy; all of it</i> <span class=\"center\"><i>yurs truly,</i></span> <span class=\"jr\"><i>XX</i></span> </blockquote> ‘When Wellington, the Chief Constable, asked my opinion, I told him the writer of the note, and therefore probably the murderer, was obviously an educated man. After explaining why I was sure of that, he agreed with me. ‘An odd sort of case. The murderer was found to be an extremely wealthy American whose sister had married the murdered man’s brother.’ ‘Well,’ laughed Bill Cargo to whom Fordney had been speaking. ‘It’s getting too involved for me.

Can you tell where he is Dad knew that the boys liked to play games with him and their mother. He also knew that Andy expected some questions. He started by asking, “I suppose you know where he is?” Andy, who expressed himself quite well for a five year old, replied, “Yes, I’ve been with him all afternoon. I know where he is but we want you to find him.” “OK. Tell me where you’ve been.” Andy started speaking hurriedly, causing Dad to have to remind him to slow down. Andy started again, forcing himself to speak more slowly. “Well, we’ve been in Matthew’s room, my room, the garage, the tree house and the hall closet.” Andy grinned, laughed, and said, “I bet you can’t find him!” Dad chuckled. This wouldn’t be too hard. At least, he did not think it would be. Three-year-old Matthew had an advanced way of losing things – and himself! Dad took a long look at his oldest son, as he often did. There were grass stains on his feet and the remnants of a chocolate bar around his lips. A typical five year old, he thought, before saying, “OK, but after we find him, you need a bath!” Almost shouting, Andy pleaded, “Tell me where he is!” Dad answered, “First, let’s takes a look around The first thing they inspected was the hall closet. The hall closet was right off of the entrance to the den. Dad had seen them open the closet door and shut it earlier in the afternoon before they headed upstairs. Next, they went upstairs to Andy’s room. There was a big water spill right at the entrance. Andy had brought an uncovered glass of water upstairs against his mother’s wishes earlier that morning and dropped it when opening the door to his room. Dad noticed with irritation the puddle was just as he had seen it several hours ago as nobody had bothered to wipe up the puddle. Andy was grinning and giggling. He was certain he and his little brother were putting one over on Dad. Dad said nothing but motioned for them to journey next to Matthew’s room. Matthew’s room was unusual. The closet was directly opposite the room entrance and had no door. The slide doors had been removed long ago and one could easily see everything in the closet. Looking over at Matthew’s crib bed, he realized he and Mom were going to have to get him a “big boy” bed soon. Mom was going to have to find another place to store the short pile of books, which were underneath the crib. Interestingly enough, the room had no other furniture. Dad and Mom could and, usually, did inventory everything in the room just by a quick scan from the hall when something of Matthew’s was missing, which was often. Next, Dad and Andy went outside to survey the tree house, which sat in the middle of the large back yard. Dad frowned as he remembered that Mom had chided him for watering the yard earlier. Now, he couldn’t mow until tomorrow. He looked down and saw his shoes were damp from the still wet grass. He silently berated himself for wearing his new house shoes outside. He could already see a green tinge on one of them. Finally, they went to the garage, departing through the kitchen. Andy was a little hesitant to go there. He knew Dad and Mom got mad if he or Matthew went to the garage without one of them, although that did not stop either of them from doing it occasionally. Not only did Dad have a room full of tools and chemicals that were not kid friendly, but the garage floor had many years of grime on it. Invariably, when Matthew or Andy would venture there alone, they would track oily grime onto the kitchen floor upon returning back into the house. Dad looked around for a moment and said, “OK, Andy, let’s go back into the house.” Back in the den, Andy became excited again, asking, “Where is he, where is he?” Dad grinned and said, gently, “I know where he is. Let’s go get him.” Where is Matthew?\n  choice: Matthew's bedroom\n  choice: The tree house\n  choice: The garage\n  choice: Andy's bedroom\n  choice: The hall closet\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: Steve Clairborne stretched his long arms up over his head and yawned. Another morning of tedious audit work had at last gone by the wayside. “How ‘bout lunch, guys?” the pencil-thin, red-topped young man asked. As senior accountant in charge of the audit staff, he set the pace. “Let’s do it!” Shel Jonas yelped, slamming his pencil down onto his desk. The rotund first-year staff assistant liked his food. Tro Nguyen and Steve laughed. Anything to break the tension of the grueling ten-hour workdays that were the norm for public accounting staffs at their clients’ businesses during the fiscal year-end ‘busy season’. Cynthia Kirwan, a born accountant in both appearance and attitude, didn’t share in the laughter. Tro carefully placed the gold-trimmed mechanical pencil his parents had given him as a university graduation present down on his desk. “You can lock up the room, can’t you, Steve?” he asked. “Don’t sweat it, Tro,” Steve replied. “I got a key from Benjamin a couple of hours ago, so you won’t have to take your pencil out to lunch with you.” “Yeah, but I’ve kind of had my eye on that expensive writing instrument,” Shel winked. “I doubt it,” Tro retorted, smiling at his colleague. The size-large auditor laughed. Clumsy and heavy-handed, he was still an ace when it came to his accounting and auditing work. “Yeah,” he admitted, “those mechanical jobbies are way too delicate for me – I keep breaking the lead. Just give me a fistful of #4’s and a good sharpener and a big eraser and I’m ready to tick and bop the books ‘til the end of busy season.” “Graphite smears,” Cynthia sniffed, “and gets on my fingers; that’s why I always use my mini-computer to take notes or a ballpoint pen to make notations.” “Fascinating,” Shel teased. “Okay everybody,” Steve said, “let’s get out of this walk-in closet and get some lunch.” Benjamin Trodger, the controller at the company Steve and his staff were auditing, had allowed the auditors to use the company mail/supply room as their base of operations. It was a small, narrow room, and the five desks brought in for Steve’s team had to be lined up one after the other single file-style, like a school classroom row. Tro’s desk was the one closest the door, Steve’s the furthest one back. It was a tight fit, and there wasn’t much room between and on either of the side of the desks. But at least the auditors had ready access to the company accounting staff housed in the one-storey office building. “Is Dan still grilling Benjamin about those over 90 days receivables?” Steve asked, after everyone had arisen and moved towards the door. “Or vise versa,” Tro cracked from the doorway. Dan Skinner, a wry, wiry guy with unkempt brown hair, was the other student on the staff working under Steve’s direction. He’d been given the assignment of examining the client company’s revenue and accounts receivable systems and reported results for the year. As company controller, Benjamin Trodger bore the brunt of the questioning from the auditors. But the sour, middle-aged man liked to give as good as he got, constantly asking his inquisitors: What’s the point of that question? Why do you need that, anyway? When are you going to finish the audit and leave? Steve followed Tro, Shel and Cynthia out the door. Then Tro peeked his head back into the room, looking at his mechanical pencil lying on his desk. Steve moved the young man aside and locked the door. “See,” he said, holding up the key, “all secure.” They walked along the outer edge of the cubicle farm that was home to most of the company’s accounting staff and found Dan flipping through a delinquent accounts ledger he’d propped up on top of a filing cabinet. “Lunch?” he said, looking hopefully at the group. “Lunch!” Shel responded, slapping the guy on the back. “What happened to your Q&A session with Benjamin?” Steve asked. Dan grunted. “Mr. Seldon happened. He called Benjamin into his office for a ‘lunch conference’ just as I was getting going with the guy. Benjamin grabbed up a brown bag and ran out of his own office so fast I almost got a windburn.” Mr. Seldon was the company president. He ran the steelmaking operation with an iron fist. Dan made a quick note on a piece of green 7-column paper, and the lead in his mechanical pencil snapped. “Cheap piece of junk,” he growled, pumping the end of the pencil with his thumb to get some more lead out the tip. But the lead jammed inside of the pencil, rendering it useless until it could be disassembled and fixed. “Let’s go,” Dan said, shrugging. He folded the paper and stuck it in his pants pocket, then clipped the pencil to his shirt pocket. The auditors walked down an office-lined hallway towards the rear doors of the building which opened out onto the company parking lot. They all caught a brief glimpse of Benjamin Trodger inside Mr. Seldon’s office. The controller was perched on a chair next to the company president’s desk, a cheese sandwich and apple laid out in front of him. It sounded like Mr. Seldon was giving the accounting man a rather rough interpretation of what he saw in the company’s most recent monthly revenue and expense report. The controller cast a sour glance at the auditors as they trooped by. Shel inhaled a medium meat lover’s pizza for lunch, while Tro, Steve and Dan downed cheeseburgers. Cynthia picked over a mandarin orange salad, which she’d almost insisted on showing the cook at the local restaurant how to prepare. With their stomachs topped up and their sixty minutes of budgeted lunch time over, the auditors headed back to their client’s building down the street. They walked past the president’s office again and saw that Benjamin was still in conference with Mr. Seldon. The controller was perched in exactly the same position as before, the only change being that his sandwich and apple were now gone. “They’ve been at it for over an hour non-stop,” Mary Thomason, Mr. Seldon’s secretary, whispered to Steve, shaking her head. “Here, you open up the audit room, Dan,” Steve said, once they were back on the outskirts of the accounting cubicle farm out front. “I’ve got to go to the bathroom.” He tossed the key to the young man at the head of the column of auditors. Dan caught the key and briskly strode on to the audit room door, opened it up and entered the narrow, cramped room, followed shortly thereafter by Tro, Cynthia and Shel. “My pencil’s gone!” Tro cried, loud enough for Steve to hear just as he was rounding a corner for the bathroom. He ran back to the audit room, closing the door behind him so that the client staff didn’t hear any more. “You sure?” he asked Tro. “Yes! It was lying right on my desk at the front when we left. You saw it. Now it’s gone!” “Someone must’ve swiped it while we were out to lunch,” Shel said. “You sure you have the only key to this room, Steve?” Steve ruefully rubbed his chin. “I said I had a key. Not the only one. Benjamin has another.” Tro’s eyebrows shot up. “You think-” “Yes, I think I know exactly who took your mechanical pencil,” Steve responded. Who stole the pencil?\nAnswer:",

He was trying desperately to scratch the back of his itchy green elf costume. \"We're supposed to be elves,\" whispered Jimmie, his best friend, “so try to act cheerful!\" Jimmie smiled as the children formed a line to sit on Santa's lap. With his curly red hair, Doug thought, Jimmie actually looked like an elf. It helped that Jimmie was always smiling. He, it would appear, had a better attitude than Doug. Their job was to entertain waiting children with smiles and rhymes — but Doug wasn't smiling. His green cap was hot and uncomfortable, and his head was starting to itch, making it difficult to pretend that he was really a cheerful elf. \"You begged me to get you this job,\" Jimmie teased, \"and we can't find another elf now. So you're stuck here until Christmas!\" Doug was glad their shift would be over at 4:00 p.m., as he wanted desperately to take off his obnoxious pointy shoes with jingling bells, and to finally get back into his quiet sneakers. \"Welcome, kids, to Santa's store! … We're here for an hour more!\" Jimmie grinned at Doug, but slowly his facial expression turned timid, as he nodded in the direction of Mr. Corrigan, the shopping mall's wealthy owner. If Corrigan caught them goofing around, they would be at risk for losing their jobs. Though Mr. Corrigan wore a cheerful red Christmas sweater, he seemed worried. He was talking to a young woman with a clipboard. What she was saying, the boys couldn't tell — but she was moving her hands frantically, and the boys sensed trouble. Mr. Corrigan checked his watch and left in a hurry — still without smiling — and the woman with the clipboard walked over to them, the elves. She seemed very upset, and Doug wanted to help. \"Is there anything wrong?\" he asked. Mrs. Martin glared. She was, apparently, having a bad day, and Doug had just broken the rules. \"Everything you say is supposed to rhyme,\" she shot back sternly. \"It's in the ‘Rules for Elves’ booklet we gave you on your first day here. Didn't you memorize the rules?\" Doug looked to Jimmy for help. Jumping in quickly, Jimmy said, \"Sorry about my friend. He's new!\" Doug, wide-eyed, followed with, \" … I forgot what I should do!\" Mrs. Martin laughed, \"I'm sorry, guys,\" she said wearily, \"I shouldn't be cranky — especially at Christmas time. But I'm in a lot of trouble. I've been robbed — that is, the store has been robbed. Someone stole a lot of money from one of our cash registers. It's the one in back of where Santa sits, behind the giant candy canes.” \"It's Santa's money that they stole? … They deserve a lump of coal!\" Mrs. Martin smiled again at the improvised rhyme. She, now less irritated with the elves, added that policemen were already investigating the crime. But her worried face told Doug the police weren't having any luck. \"I check the cash register every hour, but I always leave it locked,\" she said with concern. \"That means the thief had to be someone who works for the mall.\" Mrs. Martin had another problem. Mr. Corrigan was worried that the mall wasn't earning enough money, and so he had invited a banker to visit them that morning. She still hadn't told him how much it had cost to build Santa's display. \"The giant candy canes were expensive, and he doesn't know that this year I've hired two elves.\" Now the police were investigating Mr. Corrigan — and it was likely that they would question Mrs. Martin, as she was responsible for all of the mall's money. Beside herself, the only people who had a key to the register were Mr. Corrigan, the photographer and Santa Claus. \"Maybe we should take a look. … Santa's not a Christmas crook!\" Mrs. Martin agreed, and the case had begun. Instead of playing elves, they were now playing detectives. And Doug was happy that they'd get to stop working early. Until he heard some very bad news … \"You have to keep your elf costumes on!\" Mrs. Martin shouted after them. At which point, Doug realized this would prove to be one goofy investigation. \"What am I supposed to do?\" he complained to Doug, “Just walk up to a suspect and ask: 'Any hints that we can use? Have you noticed any clues?’\" Jimmie laughed, and added, \"Know when all the money leaves? Did you notice any thieves?\" But his laughter stopped abruptly when a stern new voice commanded, \"We need to talk to you.\" Doug was startled to see a blue police uniform with a large badge, and a serious-looking man with a big moustache. \"You two work outside the room where the cash was stolen. Did you elves ever feel tempted to steal some cookie money out of Santa's cash register?\" Jimmie was surprised at the question, and police officers made him nervous. Looking nervous made him seem guilty, Doug realized, so he did the talking for both of them. \"We just greet the kids as elves. … We wouldn't take their cash ourselves!\" \"Look,\" he said with agitation, \"somebody told me they'd seen two suspicious elves opening the register. And right after the visit, all of Santa's cash disappeared.\" Jimmie was too scared to talk, but Doug knew what to say: \"We just work outside his store. We just jingle! Nothing more!\" The policeman noticed, with annoyance, that Doug was talking in rhymes. He looked at their strange green costumes, and started to issue a warning with his long, pointed finger. Instead, the officer shook his head and walked away. Jimmie started talking fast, \"We didn't steal the money!\" he told Doug excitedly. \"You've been with me the whole time! Who would tell a policeman that we'd been near Santa's register?\" \"The thief!\" Doug answered. \"They're trying to trick the police into arresting us.\" \"I don't want to spend Christmas in jail!\" Jimmie wailed. But Doug was too busy to console Jimmy, as he was staring curiously at Santa Claus. A happy little boy was sharing a list of the toys that he wanted for Christmas. While he sat on Santa's lap, a photographer took his picture. The child’s mother gave $15 to the photographer. In turn, he gave the mother a ticket that would allow her to pick up the pictures later. The photographer was a silent middle-aged man with bags under his eyes. Doug thought he looked too tired to smile, and wondered if the mall also had a “Rules for Photographers” booklet, since the grumpy photographer was wearing a cheerful red hat trimmed with white fur. \"Smile,\" he said to a little girl — while not smiling at all himself. Jimmie motioned to a table beside the photographer. The photographer had already used several dozen rolls of film; the table beside the cash register was cluttered with empty black cylinders. The photographer seemed annoyed, looking at the two elves with an irritated expression. Jimmie tried to launch an explanation, \"Would you notice something funny? … Do you know who stole the money?” \"I already told the police,\" the photographer griped. \"Besides, I don't think they're missing as much money as they think. Corrigan just wants the insurance company to reimburse him for money that was never stolen. I've only shot pictures of 18 kids today.\" Santa Claus laughed a hearty \"Ho! ho! ho!\" The photographer rolled his eyes, and went back to his camera. The little girl struck a pose, smiling like a movie star. She ran to tell her father about Santa Claus. The indifferent photographer waited while the girl's mother searched her purse for $15. Doug decided it was a good time to question their next suspect, \"You seem cheerful, Mr. Claus. … Have you broken any laws?\" Santa laughed, and his dark, shiny eyes seemed to twinkle above his white beard. It was a thoughtful laugh, a slower \"Ho, ho, ho\" as Santa seemed to think carefully about how to answer the elves. \"No, boys, I didn't take the dough. … They won't ever let me go!\" Doug and Jimmie, confused, stared back silently. \"The mall's rule booklet!\" Santa explained, laughing at his rhyme's ineffectiveness. \"Santa has to remain seated at all times — so I never get a bathroom break!\" Santa pointed at the old cash register, which sat on the photographer's table on the opposite side of the room. \"Besides, when you're as fat and jolly as I am — it's hard to stand up! Ho, ho, ho!\" Santa said, as a little boy rushed in to sit on his lap. The photographer nodded silently in agreement. Once an hour the photographer put the money in the cash register, and it was Mrs. Martin who would scoop it up and deliver it to Mr. Corrigan. And so, the elves headed for Mrs. Martin's office. \"Should we skip?\" Jimmie joked. Jimmie had already thought up a rhyme for when they would confront Mrs. Martin: “We must ask you questions, too. With the money, what'd you do?\" But when they got to her office, they spotted the police officer walking in the same direction. When the officer noticed the elves, he displayed an irritated expression. He tried to ignore their costumes, muttering, \"I need to talk to Mrs. Martin. She's the last suspect, and I haven't questioned her yet.\" But Doug suddenly jumped in front of him, put his hands on his hips, and delivered a rhyme in his sassiest, proudest elf voice, \"Wait!

        "inputs": "Story: “It’s hardly murder,” the inspector complained as he kicked at the shredded remains of the scarecrow. “Well that’s just the thing, Inspector Gregson,” Mr. Forbes said. “This is the fourth time it has happened. It will be murder next and it will be me that gets murdered. I am to be knifed in my bed before you think to investigate properly.” “There’s not much for me to investigate,” Gregson said. “Every day you put a scarecrow out on your estate and every night he gets viciously sabotaged.” “You admit it then!” The old man shrieked. “You admit it’s a sabotage!” “The damage was certainly done with a knife of some kind. The tears are not the ragged kind I’d expect to see if a wild animal had done this.” “Probably a gang.” “Mr. Forbes, please. If you can give me some facts then do so, but leave the theorizing to the official forces,” said Inspector Gregson. Mr. Forbes muttered something under his breath about the theories of the official forces. Inspector Gregson decided it was best to pretend he hadn’t heard. He wondered if the old man could have concocted this bizarre case himself in order to get some publicity for his business. Over in the courtyard, Gregson spotted the butler, a skinny but wiry man with an extremely sour expression on his face. “My superior told me you actually saw this supposed gang last night.” Gregson said, continuing his discussion with Forbes. “That’s right. I heard the sound of tearing cloth and looked out of my bedroom window.” “How many were there?” “Well, I couldn’t rightly say. My eyesight isn’t what it was, but I could make out some commotion in the vicinity of the scarecrow. Whoever it was certainly made a brutal attack. The scarecrow came apart as though it were made of paper, destroyed completely in seconds by the ferocious attack.” The attack had certainly been ferocious, the inspector mused. Not only had the scarecrow's clothes been cut up, but the stick propping it up had been cut clean through. “It was then that I phoned the police,” Mr. Forbes said, dramatically. According to his superior, Mr. Forbes had called the police the previous night to report another attack in progress. Gregson had volunteered for the job. The idea of a psychopath incensed at scarecrows to the point of manically ripping them to shreds had been rather appealing to him, at least compared with spending Friday afternoon filling out dreary paperwork. The more time he spent with Mr. Forbes, however, the more he regretted not being back at the station. “Why not just stop putting a scarecrow out?” Gregson asked. “What?! Let them win? I have a business to run here. People come to look around the house. My grandfather was a great explorer and we have some of his things here for visitors to see. There is an amusing idea that he hid treasure somewhere on the grounds. Besides, if I stop putting out a scarecrow, what’s to say it won’t provoke whoever is doing this? What’s to say they won’t come after me that very night?” “All right, all right,” the inspector said wearily, as he raised his hands to stop the tirade. “I’d like to speak to the other people in your household: the cook, the maid and the butler.” The maid, Annie, was a shy girl of twenty who was working at the house for the summer. She gave Gregson the impression that she wasn’t much relishing her job and was outspoken in her dislike of Mr. Forbes. Gregson wondered if Annie would take such extreme measures to frighten her boss. When Gregson questioned her, she told him that she had been too frightened to sleep the previous night. She had tried to calm her nerves by pacing her room and had occasionally glanced out the window towards the figure of the scarecrow. “I felt ever so sorry for him, sir, the poor scarecrow all alone out there in the night. And then the slasher came.” ‘You saw someone!’ The inspector exclaimed. “Not clearly, but I saw a single figure cross the field from the house. The person prowled along, very agile, like a cat, and darted from one shrubbery and potted plant to another, as if trying to stay hidden. When the figure got up to the scarecrow, he – or she, I suppose – seemed to attack it. Then I saw the gleam of a knife, shining silver in the moonlight. It was dreadful.” “Do you recall the time when you saw the slasher?” “Yes, I had looked at the clock just before I looked out the window. It was twenty minutes past eleven.” This matched exactly the time that his superior had said Mr. Forbes had called in the crime. Gregson went to the ground floor to interview the cook, a woman named Mrs. Avery. She met him as he was approaching the kitchens. She had a bad limp that seemed to encumber her movement to a great extent. To the inspector’s surprise, Mrs. Avery produced a large set of keys from her pocket and unlocked the door. “You lock the house kitchen?” Gregson asked. “I have to, sir. The butler has taken it into his head to help himself to provisions and I can’t baby-sit him as well as run this house. I can barely keep up with the work. The maid is too flighty and feeble to even help me with the washing let alone any of the heavy work. The butler seems more interested in loitering in here, probably trying to pinch food, than doing any real work. I even have to make up the scarecrow, only to have it ripped to shreds every night. As if I don’t have enough to do already.” “Philips doesn't look like a man with a large appetite,” the inspector said, laughing. “Perhaps he is developing one.” “Developing, Mrs. Avery? How long have you had to lock him out like this?” “Four days, sir. I remember exactly because he started up this silly behaviour when I sorted out the attic for old clothes to put on that wretched scarecrow. You can see the spare ones over there in the corner.” The inspector nodded. “Thank you, Mrs. Avery. That will be all. Please tell Mr. Philips I wish to see him now.” Mrs. Avery left while Inspector Gregson squatted down and rooted through the spare clothes. After a few moments, he drew his hand out from the pile and wrapped around his fingers was a beautiful, glittering necklace.” “Why do you need to see me?” The butler snapped from the doorway. “I was hoping that you could answer some questions for me,” Gregson said. “Have you seen or heard anything relating to these scarecrow slashings that could shed some light on the matter?” “Seen nothing, heard nothing,” came the curt reply. “Where were you last night between eleven o'clock and midnight?” The inspector asked. “Sleeping in my bed, like any decent person. Is that against the law?” “Not at all,” Gregson said. “And may I ask what has caused your recent increase in appetite? An appetite so intense, it seems, that Mrs. Avery felt it necessary to lock you out of the kitchen?” The butler's face became a scowl. “High and mighty Mrs. Avery. She locks the kitchen because she can. She has a petty position of power and enjoys lording it over me.” “Well, thank you for your co-operation,” the inspector said, dryly. “Perhaps it will interest you to know that I have reached my conclusion as to the identity of the scarecrow slasher.” Who is the scarecrow slasher?\nAnswer:",
        "targets": [
            "“I knew it had to be someone in the house, since the figure of the slasher was seen to cross the field to the scarecrow from the direction of the house,” Gregson explained. “It couldn’t have been Mr. Forbes because he was on the phone with the police when the slasher was spotted by the maid. The maid also told me that the figure was very agile, which rules out the cook; with her bad leg her movement is cumbersome at best.”\n\n“Why believe everything Annie says?” The butler snapped. “She could have done it!”\n\n“No,” said Inspector Gregson. “Mrs. Avery told me that Annie can barely help with the household chores. If she cannot lug piles of sheets around, I doubt that she has the strength to hack scarecrows to pieces with a blade, and she certainly can’t cut wooden poles clean through.\n\n“It's also extraordinary that your sudden burst of appetite started the day of the first scarecrow incident. It’s quite clear to me, Philips, that you wanted to get the scarecrow’s clothes, or rather something in the clothes, since you destroyed them in the process of searching them.”\n\nGregson held up the sparkling necklace for Philips to see.\n\nPhilips wrung his hands together. “I’ve not harmed anyone,” he wailed. “It has often been suggested that the old master of the house concealed something of great value within these walls. Over the years I’ve searched for it and then all of a sudden Mrs. Avery found those old clothes to use for the scarecrow, I’d have looked through them in my own time but she locked me out of the kitchen. I knew that if I destroyed the scarecrows she’d have to make new ones and gradually I’d be able to search all the clothes.”\n\nPhilips hid his face behind his hands and his shoulders started to shake.\n\n“Now Philips,” the Inspector said gently. “I suggest you tell Mr. Forbes that you discovered the necklace during your round of duties and so return it to its rightful owner. If you are yearning for extra funds, I suggest that you write a book. A first-hand account of the terrifying attacks of the Scarecrow Slasher will certainly not be left to gather dust on the shelves.”"

Four of the characters in the story are lying and are “exonerated” from telling the truth. The character who is “incriminated” is telling the truth. Terry Brennan was enjoying a glass of wine before dinner with his wife of over 30 years, Rochelle. The early June evening was perfect and, as they relaxed on the spacious outside patio deck, he was explaining to her how much he had enjoyed finding several long lost friends on one of the internet’s many social networking sites. “Since signing up on E-Friends a couple of weeks ago, I have found several of our old chums from the early 1960s.” Terry and Rochelle had known each other since they met in Mrs. Bowden’s afternoon kindergarten class in the fall of 1955. Neither of them liked to be reminded that was almost 54 years ago. Taking a bite of cheese, Rochelle, asked, “So, who have you found?” Terry replied, “So far I’ve become network friends with Billy Flowers, Jane Neal, Paula Newsome, Jimmy Smith and Larry Gerard.” “Why, I remember them well!” exclaimed Rochelle. “But, I haven’t seen or heard from any of them in almost 50 years. When our family moved across town in the summer of 1961, I lost track of all of them.” Terry chuckled, “Well, our family stayed put and I lost track of them too. Friendships change when you enter junior high school.” “True,” Rochelle replied, thoughtfully, “but tell me about them.” Terry poured another glass of wine. He was in a playful mood. “Well, there is much to tell, but since we are relaxed and in no hurry this evening, allow me to relate some of the emails they have sent me. See if you can figure out which one is telling the whole truth. Four of the five old friends I have mentioned have told me some things that, simply put, cannot be 100% accurate.” There was a twinkle in her husband’s eye. Rochelle knew that whatever Terry was about to say, it would be good. She said, “I’m not certain what you are getting at, but start talking.” Terry grinned. He loved a good story and was in his element. Now, he was about to share several of them with his still lovely wife. Life was good, he thought. He began, “Well, I know you and Jane Neal were friends, so I’ll start with her. By the way, I should say before I forget that I purposefully waited until now to tell you about E-Friends. I want you to enjoy this little brainteaser I’ve prepared for you.” Rochelle smiled at Terry, saying, “I’ve already told you to start talking.” “Smiling back, he said, “OK. Jane was the first of our old childhood pals that I found. I sent her a friendship invitation and she readily accepted. In a couple of subsequent emails, she told me that her life has not been a happy one.  Disillusioned by the Vietnam War, she traveled around the country in an old tour bus with a group of Ken Kesey style merry pranksters after high school graduation. But, she had, and still possesses, a serious side. Jane worked very hard on the Robert Kennedy presidential campaign during the summer of 1968 and voted for him in the general election. Nixon’s election threw her into a several year funk. She has been married and divorced several times and has had ongoing problems with drug abuse. Today, she lives in a commune in Idaho, sort of a throwback, retro lifestyle from the 1960s. To end Jane’s story on a high note, she claims to be more at peace with herself now than she has ever been.” Rochelle and Terry were enjoying the wine, cheese and conversation. Rochelle asked, “Who’s next? “Billy Flowers,” replied Terry. I saw him occasionally when we were in high school, but he, as you, moved to a different neighborhood and I mainly saw him in White’s Grocery Store, where I worked part time to pay for that old car I bought. The last time I saw him, I think, was just before the Spring Prom in 1967. He was surprised and pleased to reunite with me on E-Friends, although we were never close friends. His life has been a bit happier than Jane’s although he’s had his ups and downs. He is happily married, has lived in New York since 1975 and has three grown children and three grandchildren. Since moving to New York, his politics have gone from conservative to liberal. Indeed, in the last presidential election before moving to New York, he voted for Barry Goldwater, and then voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976. Quite a shift in political thinking, but I do recall that Billy was always a bit of an open-minded, free spirit.” Rochelle and Terry were in no hurry for dinner as he continued. “Next is Larry Gerard. Larry was in the US State Department for almost 30 years, spending much time abroad. In fact, his two sons still live in London, his last post before retiring. Since 2003, he and his wife Linda have lived in Texas. He spends much of his time at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Houston, doing research for a book he wishes to write on the Johnson presidency. It appears to me that Larry has had the most professional success and happiest personal life of any of those I am speaking of now.” “What about Paula Newsome?” Rochelle asked. “Paula has an interesting story. She was one of the first of our peer group to get lucky financially. After college, she joined the staff of one of the major television networks. Recall the big hoopla over the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1976. During the years 1974-76, she was instrumental in producing the historical Bicentennial Minutes television segments, which ran up until the end of 1976. The series won an Emmy award and her career and reputation were made. Today, she is retired and lives in Los Angeles. She and her husband Alan had one son, who died of cancer in 1988.” Terry paused to catch his breath and sip a little more wine. He and Rochelle were having fun and there was one more story to go. “Jimmy Smith,” he said, “almost died of injuries suffered in a car accident in 1981. A drunk driver in a brand new Ford Taurus T-boned him running through a red light. He spent several weeks in the hospital and many months in physical rehabilitation. I admire what he has done with his life since. He and his second wife Charlene opened their own rehabilitation center and have been physical therapy instructors in Kansas City for over 20 years.” Terry and Rochelle looked at each other in the mischievous ways they both loved. Terry finished his wine and asked, “So, who is telling the truth? Rochelle told her husband who she thought was telling the truth and why. Terry asked, “Would you care to explain your reasoning?” Who is telling the truth?\nAnswer:",
        "targets": [
            "Rochelle was now a bit light-headed from the wine and eager for dinner, so she spoke quickly. “Jane was lying. Robert Kennedy was shot on June 5 and died a day later on June 6, 1968. She could not have worked on his campaign all summer and then voted for him in the general election. Billy Flowers was lying, too. He’s another one who doesn’t remember his history right. He could not have voted for Barry Goldwater in 1972. Goldwater ran against Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The same goes for Larry Gerard. The Johnson presidential library is in Austin, not Houston. Now, Jimmy Smith’s story is not political, but he too has his facts wrong. If he was injured in 1981, he could not have been hit by a Ford Taurus. They were not introduced until model year 1986.”\n\n“So,” Terry said,’ “that leaves Jane.”\n\n“Yes, it does,” replied Rochelle, who arose from her patio seat to go inside. “She told the truth about the Bicentennial Minutes. They ran from 1974-76 and won an Emmy during the last year. That’s how she became wealthy and well known.”"

He walked past the rows of empty workstations and stopped at the desk of his assistant, Donna Blake. It was 6:30 in the morning and no one else had yet arrived. As was his routine, he asked for his messages and continued toward his office. Instead of entering his normal, tidy work area, he stumbled into a chaotic one where Mr. Wilson’s desk and chair were shoved up against the far wall with papers all over the floor. The safe was blown open and all its contents were missing; at least that’s the way George described it to me, Mike Murphy, the lead detective on the case. When I first arrived at the office suite, I phoned George’s assistant, Donna Blake, to gain access. There was a card reader at the main entrance that prevented unwanted visitors; a turnstile allowed only one person to enter with each card swipe. After her corporate office had remotely disabled the security system, Ms. Blake met me at the door and escorted me back to Mr. Wilson’s office. By the time I made it to the burgled safe, my team had already dusted for prints (none were found) and sent for a squad car to bring the company’s local IT manager in for questioning because he was the closest person the company had for a security expert. In the meantime, I sat down with George Wilson, the office manager. After he described what he found in the office this morning, I asked him to tell me what happened last night before the robbery. “Well, we had a big office party to celebrate the completion of our new computer chip. It represents a new technology that puts us miles ahead of the competition,” he explained. “Since it was just approved for production, I displayed the chip last night to our whole team, and we celebrated its pending release. We shut down just before midnight because I had to be in early today to prepare for a meeting.” He hesitated: “If our rivals get hold of that chip, we are sunk.” Mr. Wilson seemed to have genuine grievances, but I‘ve seen too many good actors in my day to prematurely bank on his honesty. The last time he saw the chip, he explained, was when he put it back in the safe at midnight; moreover, it was right after the party, and in front of several different witnesses who knew he had an early and busy day ahead of him. I next interviewed Ms. Blake, George’s assistant. She seemed friendly enough, but looked very tired. She told me that she had left with everyone else last night, and had returned around 6:00 a.m. to prepare several reports for Mr. Wilson’s teleconference, which was scheduled for this afternoon. She showed me the reports; the bags under her eyes coincided with the stack of papers she juggled in her arms. “I didn’t have time to go into his office today,” she said. “I had to fix a bunch of mistakes. My lack of sleep must be affecting my concentration because I keep putting tomorrow’s date on all his reports. Maybe I subconsciously want this day to end already,” she sarcastically huffed. “I don’t know why they aren’t automatically dated like they usually are. I suppose it’s some computer glitch.” “Who else has been in the office since the party last night?” “Only Mr. Wilson, me and ... the night janitor,” she recounted. “Someone had to clean up the mess we made with our celebration.” I asked an officer to go round up the janitor, a Mr. Pete Thompson. Next I talked to Jeffery Sharp, the computer tech. According to Donna Blake, he’s in charge of the office’s computer system. He looked just as tired as Ms. Blake; apparently, Jeffery had been working overtime lately, trying to wrap up the computer maintenance before he went on a two-week vacation, which started today. Mr. Sharp seemed agitated from the start: “Look, I don’t mean to be disrespectful, but my plane leaves in less than three hours,” he spat. “And I was up all night packing.” “I’ll do my best to get you there on time.” I replied with as much diplomacy as I could muster. “Where is it that you’re headed?” “Aruba.” He answered. “With beautiful beaches, and, best of all, no computers!” “Can you can get me a printout of everyone that has been in this office since the party last night?” I asked. Without answering, he led me over to his workstation, wiped the sleep from his eyes, and began to type. Soon he handed me a printout of a very short list; it showed that only two people had entered the office that morning: Ms. Blake at 6:10 and Mr. Wilson at 6:25. “You can see I wasn’t here after the party. “Send me on my way,” he pleaded. “Let’s get all the facts, and then you can go. Stick around for a bit and we’ll wrap this up.” I said as I exited to question the last suspect. Pete Thompson, the janitor, puzzled me the most, especially because there was no record of him using the access card last night. He said he had come in at 1:00 a.m. to clean up after the party, and that he had left around 4:00 a.m. for his next shift at another location, which ended at 5:30 a.m. He had just gone to bed when the officer arrived to get him. A quick call to Pete’s second job confirmed that he had indeed arrived there at 4:00 this morning. And, from the disheveled description of the office, three hours seemed to be an appropriate estimate of time it would take to clean up. On top of that, I figure it would take at least an hour to break in to the safe. Where would Pete have found the time? I decided to make a call to the chip manufacturer’s corporate offices. Mr. Connelly, the head of security, could not explain how the janitor had entered the building without using his card. If there had been a system malfunction, he assured me that the system would simply shut down all access. I also asked him if someone in Jeffery’s position would be able to tamper with the system. Mr. Connelly said that very limited access is granted to an employee in Jeffery’s position; however, he could adjust the system to synchronize with events like daylight savings and leap years because the company’s security system is directly linked to the rest of their computer system. Jeffery couldn’t have shut the system off without also shutting off all entry — or exit. When I returned to the crime scene, I saw Jeffery complaining that he now only had two hours to make his flight. He waved his tickets around and threw them down on top of the “office access” printout he had given me earlier. I looked at his tickets and the printout again. I told Jeffery he should first meet me in the conference room — before he took to Aruba — so I could explain to him what had happened to the computer chip. Who is the thief?\nAnswer:",

            "Before going into the conference room, I asked Donna to print out the “office access” report for the last two days. I then asked her to report on what she found. She said the reports showed some confusing information. The day of the party showed, impossibly, that only two people entered the office for the entire day: First, Pete, at 1:07 a.m., and then Jeffery, at 4:15 a.m. It was blank after that. She also said that, just like on her morning reports, the dates were wrong: The one with Pete and Jeffery was dated today, and the one with her and Mr. Wilson was actually dated tomorrow.\n\nI explained that, since the security system would shut down office access if anyone local tried to turn it off, the thief had to find another way around it. Jeffery Sharp had been granted access to one small, but important, part of the security system: When he changes the date in the office’s computer system, it also changes it in the security system. So to hide his theft, the night he cracked the safe, he moved the date forward one day the night. He obviously hoped that no one would notice until he was safely out of the country.\n\nFor me, it all came together when I saw that the date on Jeffery’s tickets didn’t match the date on the access report for the day of the robbery."

He had spoken with the governor’s son, Elliot, about a recent academic scandal in which he was accused of cheating on his exams and helping other students to cheat as well. It would end up being a top story for The Printed Voice and he wasn’t leaving work until he had finished a draft. Amy, a childish co-worker, peeked her head in the doorway. “Jack, come out and play!” She hopped in to face him, peering over the large stack of notes that filled his work area. He grabbed two handfuls of paper and held them up. “I’m trying to work. I’ve seen snow before.” “You’ve seen snow, eh? Well, do you see my hand behind my back?” she giggled. Something cold and wet smacked Jack in the face. Recovering from the partially melted snowball, he watched Amy scamper away. As he ran out of his office, he grabbed the door handle and pulled it shut, rattling it with his palm twice to make sure it had locked. Dashing through the lobby in hot pursuit, Jack nearly collided with another reporter, Lucy, while she was coming inside the building. “Excuse you!” Lucy yelled back at him. Lucy was a bitter reporter and the office gossip. Most people tried to steer clear of her. Jack, unfortunately, had bumped right into her. Jack called back a quick apology as he continued the chase. Running outside, he stepped on a patch of ice. He found himself on the ground, looking up at the winter sky. He sat back up and saw Mr. Jenkins, the custodian of the facility, standing on the sidewalk with his trash receptacle. “Glad to see you’re finally having some fun,” he called out to Jack with a grin. “This was not my idea of a break,” Jack groaned back. Mr. Jenkins shook his head again. “Well, I mopped up the mess in front of your office just a moment ago. I feel like I have been attacking wet footprints ever since it started snowing.” Jack gave him a frown of sympathy. “Sorry. That was from Amy, not me.” Mr. Jenkins sighed and gave a shrug before heading inside. Another co-worker, Sarah, stepped out right after him and burst out laughing when she saw Jack still sitting on the ground. “This is a change of scenery for you,” Sarah giggled as she stopped in front of him. “I bet you wish you’d landed Alex’s Sea World story … you’d be enjoying the sunny San Diego weather right about now!” Still dazed, Jack wasn’t exactly paying attention. Sarah adjusted her heavy shoulder bag, and waved her hand in front of his eyes, “Hello? Is anyone in there?” “Sorry,” he said, “I’m just stressed – as usual.” “I know how that is,” she replied. “… If only my name were Lucy, then, I’d be dating the boss’s son. And, then, I’d get to do whatever I wanted.” It looked like Sarah was leaving the office for a month rather than heading home early. She, like Jack, was a self-proclaimed workaholic. “The snow is coming down pretty heavy,” she added, “I have a feeling that if you want to head out, it will be OK.” “Well, I guess I better get back to work so I can go.” Jack stood up and wiped the remaining snow off of his clothes. As he was heading back into the office, a snowball hit him in the back of his head. He whirled around to find Amy sticking her tongue out at him. “Are you going to let her get away with that?” Sarah smiled as she began walking down the sidewalk toward the parking lot; she was leaving for the day. Jack retaliated with two snowball attacks of his own, and after fifteen minutes had passed, he decided it was time to retreat back into the warm building. Amy remained outside, choosing to freeze her toes for a while longer. Jack found himself stepping over miniature puddles of melted snow in front of his office. Mr. Jenkins had already cleaned up the mess left over from Amy’s snowball. Evidently everyone in the building was tracking in messy footprints without worrying about giving the custodian extra work. Jack rolled his eyes and unlocked his door. He stopped in his tracks. His desk was completely clean. Not a single paper remained. Walking inside, he stepped on something. Jack looked down and picked up a bent company ID card. The printed name on the card read: Alex Rebmevon. Alex, the official owner of the ID, was a fellow reporter at The Printed Voice. He was also the boss’s son. Back during his college days, Jack had once locked himself outside of his dorm room and used his student ID to pick the lock. Jack questioned if the door in his office was just as easy to get into. As Jack stood in the middle of the room, puzzled and angry by the intrusion, he heard a long whistle from behind. He turned to find Amy once again standing in the doorway. She nodded her head toward the immaculate desk. “Looks like you decided to get rid of that busy work, after all.” “I didn’t do this,” Jack held up the ID, “he did.” Amy snatched the card from his hand and studied it. “Well, it looks like this is what the culprit used alright. This card is wrecked.” “ … Only one way to find out,” Jack said, as he whipped out his cell phone and dialed Alex’s number. There was no answer. Amy was still standing in front of him. “Do you know who did it?” she asked. He thought back to Sarah and the massive shoulder bag she had been carrying. “Maybe,” he answered. But his eyes narrowed as he weighed in the evidence and ran through a growing list of suspects. Mr. Jenkins had a key to every office in the building. And he had walked back inside shortly before Jack, explaining the puddles at the door. They searched the building for the custodian and found him in the reception area, collecting trash. Jack explained the situation to him and asked about the missing papers. “You really think I would do that?” Mr. Jenkins said, hurt by the accusation. He continued, “Though, I’ll admit, I did use Alex’s ID card to break into the office. Jack replied quickly, “No, I don’t think you’re a suspect at all. You’ve been too busy cleaning all day. But, now that you mention it … why did you use the ID to break into my office?” “Well, I swear I didn’t touch anything on your desk, it was already clean as a whistle when I went in to collect your trash. I used my key to get in the first time, but I accidentally left my keys on your filing cabinet and had shut the locked door before I realized it. I found the ID on the floor earlier and it was already bent up. I figured it couldn’t be used anymore, so what was the harm in using it to get back in?” “So someone used the ID to break into my office before you found it then?” He thought about some of the things that had been taken and remembered his notes from the interview. Even the notes themselves would be something any other reporter at The Printed Voice would love to get his hands on. And one of them had. All of his co-workers were likely suspects. Who took the papers?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: “Quartermaster!” Captain Robert’s bellow was usually loud enough to be heard in the maintop, even in a three-reef gale. Today, with the Jackdaw becalmed and wallowing in the Atlantic swell, the noise was deafening. Elijah Fairfax hastened up the companionway to the quarterdeck. “Captain?” “Someone has broken the Code,” Roberts pointed into the cabin of the recently-captured Jackdaw. “One of those scurvy dogs stole for themselves. Ye know the rules. You steal from one, you steal from all. Root out this vile dog. Root him out, and I’ll make him pay.” Fairfax stepped into the cabin that once belonged to the captain of the Jackdaw. This captain and his crew were to be sold as slaves in Whydah, and his sloop would become the latest addition to Robert’s pirate fleet. After the blazing heat of the equatorial sun, the cabin was dark and cool. Fairfax stood on the threshold, letting his eyes adjust. There was not much to see: a cot, a table and chair to port. To starboard, a chest and a row of shelves with fiddles to stop the contents from sliding around in rough seas. On the chest stood a small casket, its lock prised open and its interior empty and bare. “Pieces of eight!” Fairfax jumped and swore when he cracked his head on the low beams. He reached for the cutlass at his side, eyes searching the source of the cry. He relaxed when he saw an African Grey parrot perched near the head of the cot, which was quite a prize. A talking parrot could fetch a pretty penny in the markets. A strange scent caught his attention. Orange blossom? This far from shore? He wrinkled his nose, turning his head from side to side. There. By the casket. White powder on the floor. And there, scuffed in the dust, a pair of boot prints. Fairfax turned and went back outside. Roberts was pacing the quarterdeck, his dark brows furrowed. The crew busied themselves in the waist, out of earshot of the quarterdeck, desperate to avoid catching the captain’s eye when he was in one of his black moods. “Well, have ye found ‘em yet,” he snapped. “Not yet,” said Fairfax. “Do you know what was in the casket?” “Of course I know. A necklace of diamonds and rubies. Lots of them. And two earrings to match. Made by the very jeweler to Queen Anne herself. Worth a king’s ransom. The fool tried to buy his freedom with those jewels.” Roberts shook his head, “As if we wouldn’t just take what we want anyway.” “And when did you last see them?” asked Fairfax. “Just before I rowed back to the Ranger,” said Roberts. “That was about two hours ago. And in that time, someone’s been a-thievin’. Find out who went into the cabin, and who stole the necklace, Quartermaster. And do it quickly. I ain’t a patient man!” Rapid enquiries amongst the fearful crew revealed that four men had been in the cabin in the captain’s absence. Fairfax sat in the chair in the captain’s cabin and called them in one by one. “I ain’t no thief,” said Mr Arbuthnot, the ship’s carpenter. “I came in ‘ere to check for structural damage from the dustup, so I did. And when I ain’t found none, I left.” “And yet the casket was broken into and a necklace stolen,” said Fairfax. “Child’s play for a man with your skills. And tools.” “I’m tellin’ you, it weren’t me,” bridled Arbuthnot. A shrill squawk rent the air. “Pretty necklace. Pretty necklace.” Both men glanced at the African parrot. “Mine. Mine.” “Will that be all?” asked the carpenter. Fairfax nodded and Arbuthnot levered himself out of the chair and stepped out of the cabin, his wooden leg thumping on the deck with each step. A timid boy, barely fourteen-years-old, took his place. “What were you doing in this cabin, Will?” “Looking for new shirts for the captain, Mr Fairfax, sir.” Will held his neckerchief in his hands and twisted it. “I done nothing wrong.” “New shirts?” “Aye,\" said Will. “The captain, he keeps getting sword cuts in his good silk shirts. I was looking to see if there were any here.” “And did you find any?” “No sir. The captain came back, yelled at me to hurry up or I’d miss the boat back to the Ranger. Startled me something awful, he did.” “And after he startled you, what did you do then?” “Went straight out the door just behind the captain,” said Will. “It ain't wise to keep the captain waiting.” “So you didn’t steal the necklace?” “Oh no sir. I’m a pirate,” said the boy, his chest puffed out. “I would never break the Code.” Feeling thoroughly confused, Fairfax waved Will out of the office. Will ushered in Nehemiah, assistant to the ship’s cook. “So Nehemiah, what were you doing in this cabin?” Nehemiah didn’t say a word. “Please sir, he can’t speak, sir – his tongue was cut out by the Yoruba.” “Of course, Will. Thank you. You may go.” Will left. Fairfax asked his question again. “What were you doing in the cabin? Nehemiah mimed carrying a platter. “You were bringing the captain his dinner?” Nehemiah shook his head, side to side. “No? You were clearing up after his dinner?” Nehemiah nodded. The parrot squawked, “Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly.” “And you didn’t steal the necklace?” Nehemiah shook his head, and moved his hands in an emphatically negative gesture. At a loss for further questions, Fairfax ran his fingers through sun-bleached hair and waved him out of the room. “Elijah!” boomed Bosun Ridley as he came in, stooping low under the beams. “Pretty mess we’ve got here.” “You can say that again,” said Fairfax, “Captain’s riled, crew’s upset, all because of one rotten apple in the barrel.” “Well you can’t think it was me, can you?” laughed the bosun. “Sacrifice my position just for a necklace and a pair of diamond earrings? I’ve got more sense.” “What were you doing in the cabin anyway,” asked Fairfax. “I’d have thought you’d have been busy re-reeving the rigging.” “Captain asked me to sail this ‘ere Jackdaw to Devil’s Island for a refit. Just wanted to check if this lubberly captain carried charts and instruments. Always best to be prepared, that’s my motto.” “So it wasn’t you.” “Swear on me grandma’s grave, gawd bless ‘er,” said Ridley. “Anything else, cos I’ve got to get moving smartly if I’m gonna have Jackdaw ready to sail by dark.” Captain Roberts stormed in. “You found me a man to maroon yet, Fairfax?” “Not quite. I have one question for you. Did Will go over to the Ranger with you?” “Aye. He’s a dullard, that one. I had to come back ‘ere to fetch him. He knocked all that powder on the floor and I had to drag ‘im out with me to make sure he didn’t get left behind.” “Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum,” sang the parrot. And suddenly Fairfax knew who the culprit was. Who stole the necklace?\n  choice: Mr Arbuthnot\n  choice: Will\n  choice: Bosun Ridley\n  choice: Nehemiah\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: The sun rose as George Washington rode by – tall, proud, and respected by his men. Nate rode slowly towards him, delivering an important message from the Virginia militia. In the woods, an owl hooted as the American soldiers passed on their horses, disturbing its sleep. It was early on a hot morning in July, 1780. “The British would split our army into two smaller pieces,” General Washington was saying. “But they can't! They can't travel up the river, since we've fortified the fort at West Point.” Bright sunshine sparkled on a lake as Nate approached with his message. Like everyone, Nate revered General Washington. Nearly 6,000 British soldiers had surrendered to Washington's troops at the battle of Saratoga three years earlier. But now Nate was bringing the General bad news, and as his horse clomped up the muddy farmland road, he nervously hoped that it wouldn't make his leader angry. As Nate approached, he recognized the famous general from his blue coat and three-cornered hat. “What's your name?” the general asked. “Jate Nackson,” he said nervously. “I mean, Nate Jackson.” General Washington smiled and asked if the Virginia militia was sending more troops. “Only 200, sir.” Nate saw little hint of disappointment in the general's face. It seemed Washington's success always depended on his strategy, not his resources. But suddenly, they spotted a messenger galloping towards them on a white horse. “Sir!” the messenger shouted. “The British are planning to attack our West Point fort tonight.” “But how?” “A traitor has given them a detailed map!” General Washington was alarmed, and asked for more information. Panting for breath, the messenger told his story: “It was midnight in the woods when the British major received the map,” he said quickly. “The major hid the map in his boot and disguised himself in American clothing, traveling all night on a secret path through the woods.” A worried silence fell over the group of soldiers. “As the sun rose, he was spotted making his escape on foot. And he's traveling down this very road!” General Washington turned suddenly to Nate. “Did you spend this morning riding towards us on this road?” Nate nodded quickly. “Then you must've passed the British major. We can still capture him – if we know what he looks like!” “But General,” Nate stammered, “I passed four men on the road! Any one of them could've been the British major in disguise.” He hated to disappoint General Washington again, but unfortunately, it was the truth. “There's only one thing to do,” the messenger said. “The fate of the American army depends on it, and maybe the fate of America itself. We must identify and capture the British major – and fast.” Within minutes, Nate was galloping down the road with some of General Washington's best soldiers. But could they locate the traitor's map? Suddenly, they spotted the first traveler on the road. Nate remembered seeing this man. He was traveling fast, and wearing a heavy cotton shirt. “Good morning,” the soldiers called out. “What's good about it?” the old man complained. “This heat brings mosquitoes. I only hope I don't catch a disease!” Sweat had soaked his shirt, and mud covered his humble trousers and bare feet. The soldiers laughed politely at the man's obvious discomfort. The man said his name was Edward, and that he'd been farming the land along the road for 15 years. “And I still don't like this weather!” “Look!” said Nate, pointing to another traveler, just a half mile up the road. They had barely noticed him, since his brown shirt blended with the mud around him. Leaving two soldiers to bring Edward behind them, Nate galloped quickly towards the figure with the rest of the soldiers. They discovered a young man in a thin brown shirt and leather vest. He glared at the soldiers as they arrived, and seemed uninterested in their mission. When they asked him where he was headed, he replied: “What business is it of yours?” He seemed like the wealthy son of a merchant. “What's your name?” Nate asked politely. “Lucius,” he said, sullenly, but he was clearly angry with the soldiers. “How old are you?” “Seventeen, and I hope the British beat your army,” he declared, “and soon!” “You're supporting the British?\" Nate asked. “Lots of people do,” Lucius replied. “About one out of every six people is supporting the British. War disrupts trading. I may be only a teenager, but I know that trading is what feeds my family!” Nate could understand his bitterness. With two soldiers escorting Lucius, the men rode on. The sun was getting even hotter as they passed a wide field of wheat. But soon, far ahead, they spotted a cloud of dust on the road. Nate and the soldiers galloped faster towards the cloud, discovering it came from a trotting grey horse and its shaggy-haired rider. The man's clothes were covered with dust, which had even dirtied his long, shaggy hair. “My name's Benjamin,” the man said. “Can I help you?” he asked politely. Nate was pleased that Benjamin was much more friendly than the last traveler they'd met. Benjamin said he planned to travel the road all the way to Charleston so he could visit his nephew. “It's a long way, but I figured I'd take my time,” he laughed. “I'm going just until I can find a shady tree to eat lunch under!” It did sound like a reasonable plan. But when Nate looked down the road ahead, he thought he'd spotted the fourth traveler. Leaving two soldiers behind, Nate and the others rode their horses up the road. They were soon greeted by a young man in his twenties, walking slowly down the road. Nate eyed him suspiciously, but the man seemed friendly enough. “Hello!” he said as Nate approached. “My name's Nate.” “Well, my name's Jonathan!” He extended his hand for a hearty handshake. Jonathan had short, yellow hair, and he shielded his eyes as he looked up at Nate. The midday sun was bright, as it was now nearly noon; but Jonathan's eyes were also red, and lined with dark circles. Jonathan said he was traveling to the Virginia coast, where he hoped to find work as a sailor. “It's a hard road to travel,” said Jonathan. “But an honest road.” Nate sat on his horse, thinking about the four travelers they'd met. The American army might be destroyed unless he determined which traveler was secretly a major in the British army. As the soldiers gathered the suspects, his eyes lit up with excitement, “I know who has the traitor's map!” Who has the traitor's map?\n  choice: Edward\n  choice: Lucius\n  choice: Benjamin\n  choice: Jonathan\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: The alarm woke Diane to another fabulous New Hampshire day. It was her third summer working as a counselor at Camp Trevya on Lake Winnipesauke, where she spent her days swimming in the lake, hiking in the mountain woods and breathing in the fresh mountain air. Being the senior camp counselor, Diane got first choice of cabins. She always picked the cabin a bit farther from camp because it had the best view of the lake. More important to Diane, it had permanent screens covering the windows, to keep bugs out. Some of the closer cabins had screens that could be opened, which let bugs in (and, let sneaky campers – out). As she looked out the window of the cabin, she could see the sunlight starting to brighten the eastern sky. This morning she was tired. For the third night in a row, Lizzie, one of her campers, had needed to use the bathroom at 3:00 a.m. Diane, being a counselor, had to escort her to the facilities, by the dining hall. At least last night Lizzie hadn’t begged Diane to get her ice for her nightly glass of water. She had finally understood that the ice machine was in the kitchen, and that the kitchen was locked at night. Luckily, Lizzie would only be at camp for one week. Diane had to hurry if she wanted to catch the sunrise before going to blow revelry over the loudspeakers to awaken the camp. Blasting everyone out of bed each morning was always a pleasure to her, for among other things, she was a prankster who loved playing tricks on people. With a smile on her face she headed out the cabin door. “AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!” No need for revelry today. Her scream woke the entire camp. Diane looked around and there was water and ice everywhere. Someone had rigged several large buckets of ice water to dump as soon as she or one of the campers in her cabin walked out the door. Once she got over the shock of being soaked, she laughed, “Does someone want to challenge me to a prank-off!” She would get the upper hand, but first Diane had to figure out who was responsible for the joke. There were only four possibilities. The first being the campers in her cabin. The other three suspects were fellow counselors, occupying the three other cabins. Diane was just starting to think about the suspects when all five of her campers came out of the cabin onto the porch. “What happened?” one of the campers asked. “Simple” said Diane. “Someone rigged all of these buckets so that as soon as the door to our cabin opened, they would dump water onto the person’s head. I was the lucky one to walk out first, so I got soaked.” By this point, everyone else from camp had shown up to see what had caused the scream. Now that everyone could see that no one was hurt, everyone was having a really good laugh looking at Diane standing there like a drowned rat. Diane laughed as well, for she knew that she would eventually get the last laugh. Looking around, Diane noticed that two of the three counselors were not there. “Has anyone seen Tom or Allie?” An answer came from a laughing onlooker in the crowd, “If you weren’t all wet and disheveled, maybe you’d remember that Tom has kitchen duty this week!” Yes, Diane did remember. She also remembered that whoever had kitchen duty had to be at the dining hall by 5:00 a.m. to unlock the kitchen, scrub the floors and to begin preparing breakfast for the campers. Looking right at Danny, she asked “Has anyone seen Allie?” Allie was the other female counselor and someone that Diane had pulled a fantastic prank on two summers ago. Danny just shrugged. One of the campers replied for him. “She had to take Cindy into the ER about midnight last night … she’s not back yet.” “What happened?” “Well, Danny took some of us on a hike yesterday that went almost 20 miles through the mountains. We didn’t get back until fairly late and everyone just went to bed and passed out exhausted. During the night, Cindy got horrible cramps in her calves. Allie tried massaging it, a heating pad and everything else she could think of, but nothing seemed to help. She should be back soon.” That was it. Diane knew who the prankster was. Who is the prankster?\nAnswer:",
        "targets": [
            "It was pretty clear to Diane that none of her campers could have been involved. After all, the door was the only way in or out of their cabin. Since the buckets were on the outside of the cabin, if one of her campers had done it, they could not have gotten back inside.\n\nGiven that Diane had gone to the bathroom with Lizzie at 3:00 a.m., she knew that whoever had done it set it up after 3 in the morning. Allie was in the clear as she had taken her camper to the emergency room about midnight and was not back prior to the prank happening.\n\nThat left Danny and Tom. Danny had lead the 20-mile hike through the mountains yesterday after which all the hikers passed out. He would probably not want to get up early in the morning to pull a prank. He would have waited until he was not as tired.\n\nTom had kitchen duty this week. That meant that he not only had access to the buckets used to scrub the floor of the dining hall, but he was the only one with the key to the kitchen and the ice machine. Thus, it was Tom who would reap his just rewards."

At a loss for further questions, Fairfax ran his fingers through sun-bleached hair and waved him out of the room. “Elijah!” boomed Bosun Ridley as he came in, stooping low under the beams. “Pretty mess we’ve got here.” “You can say that again,” said Fairfax, “Captain’s riled, crew’s upset, all because of one rotten apple in the barrel.” “Well you can’t think it was me, can you?” laughed the bosun. “Sacrifice my position just for a necklace and a pair of diamond earrings? I’ve got more sense.” “What were you doing in the cabin anyway,” asked Fairfax. “I’d have thought you’d have been busy re-reeving the rigging.” “Captain asked me to sail this ‘ere Jackdaw to Devil’s Island for a refit. Just wanted to check if this lubberly captain carried charts and instruments. Always best to be prepared, that’s my motto.” “So it wasn’t you.” “Swear on me grandma’s grave, gawd bless ‘er,” said Ridley. “Anything else, cos I’ve got to get moving smartly if I’m gonna have Jackdaw ready to sail by dark.” Captain Roberts stormed in. “You found me a man to maroon yet, Fairfax?” “Not quite. I have one question for you. Did Will go over to the Ranger with you?” “Aye. He’s a dullard, that one. I had to come back ‘ere to fetch him. He knocked all that powder on the floor and I had to drag ‘im out with me to make sure he didn’t get left behind.” “Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum,” sang the parrot. And suddenly Fairfax knew who the culprit was. Who stole the necklace?\n  choice: Mr Arbuthnot\n  choice: Will\n  choice: Bosun Ridley\n  choice: Nehemiah\nAnswer:",
