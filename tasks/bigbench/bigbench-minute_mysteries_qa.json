        "inputs": "Story: Since losing his wife MaryAnn to cancer last year, fifty-nine-year-old Steven Roby had suffered periodic bouts of absentmindedness. This concerned him, as his awareness was decreasing. In their declining years, both Steven’s grandfather and uncle had suffered from Alzheimer’s disease before anybody understood what it was. Doc Harvey, the Roby family doctor for over forty years, was watching him closely. Because of this, added to the stress and grief he experienced in losing MaryAnn, he did not notice at first what was happening on the kitchen keyboard. Steven had lived in the Roby house most of his life. He inherited it from his parents thirty years ago and, because it was so spacious and well constructed, he and MaryAnn decided to make it their home. It was a decision they never regretted. Steven’s father, Steve Sr., had been a locksmith by trade. Within the comfortable family home, Steve had installed ornate locks on all of the six bedroom doors. All of the locks and keys were different in size and appearance, and there were two sets of keys to each room. One key was for the room’s occupant and the other was kept on the antique brass keyboard in the kitchen. As Steve Sr.’s five grandchildren grew up and moved out of the house and into adult life, a family tradition was started: each child would retain the key to his or her room, while its companion key would remain on the brass keyboard. This was a symbolic gesture particularly dear to the heart of MaryAnn, as she felt that it kept her children emotionally attached to their childhood home. Steven often wished that his parents could have lived to see this tradition commence and continue to this day. What Steven had been slow to notice was that lately, somebody had been tampering with the keys. One morning over breakfast, the sunlight coming through the big bay window by the kitchen table highlighted the keyboard, causing the brass keyboard and old fashioned keys to sparkle—something that happened on infrequent occasions. Steven loved those old keys. The oversize locks and the keys that fit them were works of art and constant reminders of his youth. But that morning, Steven saw that the keys were not hung as normal. He knew his memory and awareness were becoming serious issues but was certain he had not moved the keys himself. The keys usually hung with the smallest to the left, with the progressively larger ones hung to the right. The keys were numbered in sequence of size, starting with number 1 as the smallest. Hung normally, the keyed sides faced to the left with the smooth sides to the right. But today the smallest key, key number 1, was hung upside down and key number 3 was hung backwards, with the smooth side to the left. Key number 2 was to the master bedroom, and keys 4 and 5 fitted the locks in the twins’ downstairs bedrooms. Key 6 fit an upstairs bedroom, as did keys 1 and 3. Steven pondered this at the kitchen table for several minutes. Intense concentration helped him fight the onset of dementia and now he had something to figure out. He recalled mentioning to one of his children that he was as keeping something of great value in one of the kids’ bedrooms, but could remember nothing else about the conversation, or about the item of great value he had hidden somewhere. Steven knew he would have to take extraordinary measures to find who was tampering with the keys. It was obvious that one of his children was entering the home when he was away and searching for what he was already calling in his mind, “The Treasure.” So Steven devised a plan. He would hide in the house and wait for whoever was coming in unannounced. A few days later, Steven stayed home on his bowling night. He decided to hide in the upstairs hall closet and wait, hoping for two things: He hoped somebody would show up, and that he or she would come upstairs, where three of the five children’s bedrooms were. About nine o’clock, one of Steven’s two wishes came true. He heard the back door gently open and the soft footsteps that followed. He heard a faint clinking on the keyboard, but the mystery visitor stayed downstairs. The downstairs bedrooms belonged to his twin daughters April and Kirsten. April’s room was on the side of the house Steven was in now, but Kirsten’s was across on the other side of the living room, near the master bedroom. The darkness and quiet of the old house assisted him in hearing the mystery visitor open a door, but the sound seemed to come from far away. About ten minutes later, Steven heard a car pull into the driveway and back out again, obviously there only to turn around. However, the unexpected noise was enough to frighten the mystery visitor, who quickly moved to the kitchen, replaced the key, and fled through the back door. A couple of days later, Steven had let it be known that a doctor’s appointment would keep him away from the house all afternoon. Steven hid in the same upstairs closet. Sure enough, a few minutes after he should have left for his doctor’s appointment, the back door opened and he heard the same soft footsteps and light clinking on the keyboard. This time, the visitor came upstairs and opened a bedroom door, but Steven could not tell which room it was. Steven considered surprising the visitor but wished to know exactly what his child was up to and why. If he called out now, he may never learn the truth. The search was interrupted by the doorbell. Once again, the intruder hastily fled, this time bolting downstairs and departing through the back door but making very little noise. However, a clue was left behind. On the upstairs hall floor, Steven found a silk handkerchief, which appeared to be new. Steven could not tell if it was a man’s or woman’s and it had no fragrance on it. That evening, a frustrated Steven asked his sons Harold and Buddy to come over to help him move an armoire, and then to stay for dinner. He always enjoyed the company of his children, but tonight he wished to look at them in a different and uncomfortable light: all of them were suspects in visiting the Roby home in secret. Harold was first to arrive. Harold was a big man, not well coordinated physically and clumsy in his movements. Steven had hesitated in asking him to assist in moving the heavy armoire, but knew he and Buddy were there to watch him. Buddy arrived a few minutes later, with the watery eyes and runny nose of a cold that had lasted over a week. He was sure it would eventually go away, but in the meantime it was something he was simply going to have to tough out. The men got the armoire moved, dined together, and Steven still had no idea who was sneaking into the house or why, even after asking his sons numerous subtle questions during dinner. The next week, again on bowling night, Steven tried his hiding tactic once more. The mystery intruder didn’t disappoint—Steven heard footsteps coming upstairs and entering a room. He could tell it was the same room from the time before, but wasn’t sure which one it was. Midway through the intruder’s very quiet search, Steven’s telephone rang. This startled not only the intruder, but Steven as well. His arm heavily hit the wall inside the closet and the intruder heard it. Frightened, the mystery Roby relative ran swiftly down the stairs and out of the house, leaving the key in daughter Denise’s bedroom door. Over the course of the next few days, Steven spoke individually with his daughters, being careful not to give away the reason for his visits. Denise showed concern, as she always did, about her dad’s pre-Alzheimer’s condition, and Kirsten seemed to sense something was worrying her father. April sensed something wrong as well. But Steven learned nothing. He knew he would have to pull it together and figure this out. There would be no more secret visits and the guilty child knew Steven suspected something. So, over a tall glass of iced tea after he had spoken to all of his children, Steven began to replay everything he had learned and had happened in his mind. He examined the keyboard again and noticed that key number 4 had dust on it. He also knew that key number 6, which fit Denise’s room, had been used and put away twice. After a couple of hours and two glasses of iced tea, he knew two more things: He knew who was secretly entering the Roby home and why. Who is the intruder?\nAnswer:",

            "Mr. Anderson then glared at his daughter and repeated my question. Defeated and ashamed, the girl’s eyes watered as she looked down at the floor. I used the silence to explain everything: \"Jessica, you must have overheard your parents talking about the key. When your father refused to buy you a car, you came up with a plan - to steal the necklace. It was all about revenge. Since it was your birthday party, you knew all about the security. When the guard left his post, to visit the bathroom, you sneaked into the study, with the key already in your possession.\", before I had a chance to finish, her mother intervened.\n\n\nShe exclaimed: \"That's why you were in our room the other day! It had nothing to do with that book you took, did it? You are in a big trouble, missy!\". They then said their goodbyes, and went upstairs, arguing. Mrs. Neil approached me and whispered: \" It's a fake, anyway. I stole the real one years ago!\""

        "inputs": "Story: \"I'm 75 years old,\" shouted Mr. Ferguson, \"and I like Curious George!\" Everyone in the library stared at Mr. Ferguson, and Mrs. Yee, the librarian, glared, like she was trying to will him to talk more quietly. Even Mr. Ferguson's white hair seemed, like it was puffing away from his head in little tufts. But he was arguing with a seven-year-old! Mr. Ferguson had a round face and round eyes, and he looked like an angry pancake as he leaned down to make his point. \"The pictures are still funny!\" Mr. Ferguson insisted. \"And I'm glad when the monkey gets some help from his friend, the man with the yellow hat!\" Seven-year-old Skyler looked at him suspiciously. \"Maybe the books remind me of when I was young,\" Mr. Ferguson added wistfully. \"Back then, I had my whole life ahead of me.\" \"But now you're too old,\" said Skyler, and kicked him in the shins. Mr. Ferguson hated children, but he loved children's books. For 75 years he'd lived in Granville, but he'd never visited the library before. Now he visited every day, always checking out one of the tiny yellow Curious George books with their funny, cartoony illustrations. It was embarrassing when Skyler kicked him, or the librarian gave him a scolding look, but he really enjoyed the books. (And it was cheaper than going to the movies!) Sometimes Mr. Ferguson's eyes lingered over the pictures, and he imagined what it would be like to live on an island far away, like the monkey in the Curious George books. The daydreams were so wonderful, that it sometimes took a long time before he'd turn to the next page. But now Mrs. Yee was stomping over towards the children’s section to scold the two noisy patrons. Skyler took off to hide behind a tall bookshelf, expecting Mr. Ferguson to come and chase him. Despite all of this, Mr. Ferguson still thought most days in Granville to be pretty boring. The library was next to a water silo that said \"Granville\" in bold black letters, and there wasn't much to see on the one road through town. Granville Avenue had just a few stores on either side, plus a narrow building that doubled as the sheriff's office. When the children grew up, they moved away from Granville, and if you stayed, like Mr. Ferguson did, life was pretty quiet. Maybe that's why Mr. Ferguson liked the library so much. But there was one story that Mr. Ferguson had never read. The Granville public library had 34 different books that were all about the life of his favorite funny monkey. There was \"Curious George Goes to a Costume Party\" and even \"Curious George Goes to the Library.\" But now Mr. Ferguson was crouching by a floor-level shelf in the library's small children's section. He pointed his spectacles towards the books' spines so he could read every title for the book he was still looking for. “Curious George and the Pizza” Every day he’d looked through the other 33 books for that title. And every day it was gone. \"Checked out by someone else,\" he muttered, and that only made him want the book more. He never told any of the children which book he wanted and least of all, Skyler. But today, yet again, he'd have to check out a different book instead. Mrs. Yee, the librarian, seemed glad that the children's section had quieted down. Sometimes she wished she could throw out the noisy people and reserve the library for just quiet people. Yes, she'd read a story out loud every Wednesday at 2 p.m. for the children, but even then she talked in a soft, careful voice. Walking sadly to the checkout desk, Mr. Ferguson carried his second choice: \"Curious George at the Ballet.\" He tried not to look at the teenager behind the checkout desk, an intelligent looking youngster wearing glasses named Dexter. As Dexter ran his book over a laser scanner, Mr. Ferguson asked a question that would lead to a complicated mystery. Is it possible that a book could be stolen? \"There's no way!” said Dexter proudly -- pointing to the library's new anti-crime system. \"Our computer's pretty old so it can only track the adult books and the mysteries.\" But then he pointed to two tall rectangular panels, one on either side of the door. They were white and looked ordinary, but there was a fat wire connecting the two panels, and it led to a grey metal box on the wall by the checkout desk. \"Every book in this library has a small radio frequency transmitter.” Dexter said. \"If you tried to walk out the door with a stolen library book…” And then he pulled a book from the stack, and carried it over to one of the panels. The box on the wall made a very loud ringing sound as Mrs. Yee squealed in surprise. Dexter smiled proudly and said, \"It's not possible to steal a book. The alarm bells will always go off unless the book has been checked out.\" Mr. Ferguson said it seemed like a waste of time, which offended Dexter. It seemed like Mr. Ferguson was always offending people. He was sorry that he'd raised his voice today at the 7-year old, although earlier in the week he’d even raised his voice at Dexter! (\"It's never here!\" Mr. Ferguson had shouted. \"I check every single day, but the book that I want is never here!\" It had been early in the morning, and he'd been feeling cranky. He'd walked over a mile to get to the library only to once again be disappointed.) But on that day, shouting didn't seem to help. \"Shh!\" Mrs. Yee said fiercely. \"Maybe I'll feed the book to my dog and then you'll never come back and make noise in my library.\" Dexter smiled like he thought that was a good idea, so Mr. Ferguson just took a deep breath and checked out a different book instead: \"Curious George goes to the Dentist.\" But Dexter seemed happy today, proud to be triggering the loud alarm bells. \"See?\" he said smugly. \"It's just not possible to steal a library book.\" \"Except last Wednesday,” Mrs. Yee said angrily, just so she could disagree with Dexter. “What happened last Wednesday?” Mr. Ferguson asked. \"At 2:00, the box shorted a fuse for 10 minutes.” Dexter grumbled quietly. \"Because Dexter plugged a slide projector into the same circuit!\" teased Mrs. Yee. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The next day, there was a police car parked in front of the library. The sheriff's office was only two blocks away, but Granville's sheriff liked having an excuse to drive the police car around. \"I'm on official business,” he said to the librarian. \"What's that?\" asked Mrs. Yee, suspiciously. The sheriff looked down and mumbled under his breath. \"I need a copy of 'Curious George and the Pizza.'\" \"What?!\" squawked Mrs. Yee. The sheriff's face turned bright red, and he looked really uncomfortable. \"It's not for me,\" he said. \"The governor's family is having lunch in Granville today, and my wife wants to read a story to their kids. The governor is Italian-American, so she wants to read a children's book that's about pizza.\" Mrs. Yee was so excited about the governor that she clapped her hands loudly while Dexter checked the computer's records for the book. \"It says it's here -- it should be in the children's section.\" But the sheriff shook his head. The library had just opened, but he'd already checked in the children's section, and the book wasn't there. Mrs. Yee started to panic, while Dexter just looked hurt. \"Our library's anti-crime system is foolproof!\" \"There he is!\" shouted Mrs. Yee, pointing at Mr. Ferguson. \"He asks for that book every day! Arrest him!\" Mr. Ferguson glared back at Mrs. Yee, and then -- acting like a librarian – he said \"Shh!\" He was feeling even crankier than usual -- it was hot outside. And he didn't even think it was possible to arrest someone over Curious George. \"How come you're so sure I stole it?\" Mr. Ferguson said. \"I'm not the only one who wanted it. Mrs. Yee threatened to feed the book to her dog so I'd stop coming around making noise in your precious library. And when she said it, Dexter laughed! Maybe he stole it, and then hacked into the anti-crime system.\" \"Maybe Skyler stole it,\" Dexter suggested with a smile, \"just to keep Mr. Ferguson from having it.\" \"Does Skyler hate Mr. Ferguson?\" the sheriff asked. \"Well, he kicked him in the shins once,\" Dexter said. \"What are we going to do?\" wailed the sheriff. \"The governor's coming, my wife's counting on me -- and I want my Curious George!\" Can you help the sheriff find the book? Who stole the book?\n  choice: Mr. Ferguson\n  choice: Skyler\n  choice: Dexter\n  choice: Mrs. Yee\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: Ed and Ellen McAnn lived in a semi-rural area. There were rows of houses on both sides of the street but, once you left the small neighborhood they had lived in for almost ten years, you had to travel over a mile to get to the next populated suburb. Ed and Ellen liked the semi–privacy of being out, but not too far out, from the edge of the town. They never knew what to expect on Halloween. Some years, they had numerous costumed children come to their door, happily shouting to them, “Trick or Treat! In other years there was only a handful. Ed, a detective with the City Police Department, never could figure out why this was the way it was. But, on this night, he didn’t care. Ellen had agreed to answer the door and pass out treats to the many or few who would visit their home. He had a favorite movie to watch on television. The evening was crystal clear and beautiful. The moon was shining bright above their home, which sat on the north side of a street which ran east and west. In their neighborhood where there were few trees, there was more than ample lighting for children walking over lawns and across public streets. Ed and Ellen’s daughter Crystal brought their grandsons over just after dark. She didn’t see Crystal pull her car into the driveway, as it sat to the extreme west of the property and out of view of the front door. They were the first trick or treat customers and Ellen was not only surprised but delighted. This year, she was handing out starlight mints. She knew this wasn’t much but there had been the death of her aged uncle last week and there had been little time to shop and prepare for Halloween. She felt badly but there was nothing she could do about it. Ellen soon realized this would probably be a year of few children coming to the door. It was almost an hour later before the first one arrived at the front door and, over the course of the next couple of hours, there would be only four more. She turned off the porch light and closed the door just after 9:00 p.m. She and Ed thought no more about Trick or Treat night until the next morning. As Ed opened the garage door to leave for work, he noticed something propped up on the driveway, close to the door and blocking his exit. It was a small model tombstone, which bore the inscription: Few treats in this house, I fear; Tricks to all who live here! Beside the tombstone, there were a couple of broken eggs that created a small but inconvenient mess to clean up. The garage doors sat several feet back from the front of the house and anyone wishing to pull a prank by the door would do so unnoticed. Ed remembered his wife’s concern over the lack of goodies to pass out. It seems one child resented the modest starlight mint treat and wished for more. After assisting Ellen with the cleanup, he told her they would discuss it after he returned from work. That night, Ed and Ellen relaxed after dinner. He said, “Tell me about last night.” Ellen answered, “We only had five kids come to the door. I’d like to know which one pulled the “trick” on us. I recognized all of them and would like to call the parents.” Ed said, “Keep talking.” “Well, the first child, dressed as a witch, hurriedly appeared from the direction of the Smiths, our neighbors to the east and left going towards our neighbors to the west. After listening for the traditional “Trick or Treat,” I dropped a mint into the witch’s brew pot and the child skipped away. I was a little concerned for the witch because her costume was so baggy and loose fitting that I feared she would trip and hurt herself.” “Next came the lion. He was very small and with his father. After thanking me I saw them head toward the Smith home. They didn’t seem unhappy with the small treat.” “A little while later the ghost appeared. The ghost was very real looking in the moonlight as the slight breeze kept blowing the sheet, which served as the costume. The ghost came from the direction of the driveway and headed east after thanking me for the starlight mint.” Ellen continued as Ed intently listened. “Next came Superman. This boy was a little older and the tight fitting costume showed off a developing, muscular physique. He didn’t seem unhappy with his treat, either.” “Last was Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. Before leaving our door, her little dog, dressed as Toto, ran into the street to chase a rabbit in the moonlight. I went outside to make certain everything was OK. ‘Dorothy’ didn’t retrieve her dog until they were several houses up the street.” Which direction did they go? ” “West.” Ed thought a minute and smiled. He said to his wife, “You think you know who all of the five children were? “Yes, I’m certain of it. I know them all from volunteering at the school.” “Good. I know whose parents you need to call.” Who created the mess?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: Forest View House was an isolated mansion owned by an elderly man named Mr. Howard Peters. One wild, autumn night, Mr. Peters was entertaining guests and in the small hours of the morning screams awoke the occupants of the house. Miss Lucy Smith had looked out of her bedroom window and seen the limp form of Mr. Peters hanging from one of the garden trees and started to scream. Everyone rushed out to the hanging figure. After staring at it for several minutes however, they could see that it was not Mr. Peters himself but an old first aid dummy dressed in his clothes. The confused party made their way back to the house only to discover that a priceless painting had been stolen while they were outside. Since the dummy and its clothing had all been taken from the house it stood to reason that the perpetrator was someone at Forest View. The matter was made more sinister by the fact that all four guests were beneficiaries in their host’s will. Mr. Peters telephoned for the police and an Inspector, a rake thin man named Alan Jefferies, duly arrived and promptly dropped down onto the nearest chair as though the walk from his car to the door of the house had exhausted him. The Inspector displayed his ID badge to the satisfaction of everyone except Dale whose poor vision compelled him to push forward to see properly and so tread on the Inspector’s foot in the process. “Well,” said Jefferies, after he had ascertained that he did not have to add a hospital visit to the already eventful morning, “I think someone should explain to me why you are all gathered here.” “It’s like this,” Mr. Peters began. “I wanted my four closest friends to gather here for the weekend as I had business to discuss with them. They are Daisy Morris, Dale Clark, Lucy Smith and Iain Potts. Daisy is my niece and she resides with me permanently; the others arrived by train yesterday evening. We all had dinner together, during which I revealed some changes to my will, and then we all retired to bed.” “What was the gist of these changes?” Inspector Jefferies broke in. “That there is no longer a fortune to be left to my four beneficiaries, at least not a very significant one, due to some bad investments I made. It was in the room where we had dinner that the missing painting was usually kept.” “Continue,” the Inspector said, noting that all the guests bristled visibly at the mention of their damaged fortunes. “Why is everyone so concerned about this painting? It’s not that valuable is it?” Lucy asked. “Very valuable, my dear,” Mr. Peters muttered. “Well,” Lucy went on, “it doesn’t seem very fair to eliminate our inheritances when you own a pricy bit of art. Why didn’t anyone tell me about it?” “You went to the bathroom,” Daisy explained to Lucy. “You weren’t there when Uncle told us about the painting. It was only a passing remark as it doesn’t affect the inheritance since it’s bequeathed to the local first aid school in Uncle’s will.” “I used to do volunteer work there,” Mr. Peters explained. “That’s why I have some equipment here in the house including the dummy that was used in this awful affair.” “I’ve been led to understand that the house was roused by Lucy’s screams,” the Inspector said. “That’s right,” Lucy replied. “I had to get up at two in the morning to take some tablets.” “Were the other guests aware of that?” Inspector Jefferies asked. “Yes they were. My windows look out onto the garden and I saw what I thought was poor Howard, murdered. I rushed out and one by one everyone else must have stumbled out of their rooms and followed to see what the matter was. I had only been staring at that frightful thing for a couple of minutes when Daisy came up behind me, Dale ran up next. It was very dark out there and all of a sudden we heard a yell and a crash. It turned out that Iain had tripped over one of the ropes used to secure what we now know was a dummy. That brought us all to our senses and we made our way back to the house.” Inspector Jefferies looked over at a man waving shyly at him from the couch with one hand and nursing his leg with the other. “Hurt badly?” Inspector Jefferies asked “Very, I’m afraid,” Iain said sadly. “Excellent,” the Inspector said, apparently unaware of the surprise in the people around him, “who discovered that it was not a real body?” “It was Dale who first made us aware of that,” Daisy replied. “We all thought it was real. It was too dark to get a clear look at the features.” “Mr. Peters, where were you during all this commotion?” Inspector Jefferies asked. “As I am rather infirm, it took me a while to get myself out of bed and down the stairs. By the time I came down everyone had returned. The nearest phone is in the dining room and so I went in there to call the police.” “We will proceed into that room Mr. Peters if you please, everyone else too,” Inspector Jefferies instructed. As soon as the group entered the dining room a small spaniel tied up on the far side of the table began to yap frantically. He showed no sign of stopping until Daisy, who was the owner of the little creature, went over and petted him until he reluctantly quietened down. “For goodness sake, Daisy, from the moment I woke up all I could hear was that canine racket and when I came in here to call the police I could hardly hear myself over his noise. He flies into a frenzy when he sees anyone other than you, you need to get him trained, there’s not a day goes by that-” “Uncle, the policeman doesn’t want to know about your domestic troubles,” Daisy said. “Oh, doesn’t he? Well, as I waited for the call to be answered I looked up at the wall here and that was when I saw that the painting had been stolen. Now, Inspector,” said Mr. Peters, “will you search the rooms?” “No,” said the Inspector, “no, I don’t think I would like to do that, your house is exceptionally large.” “-but” “Besides,” the Inspector continued, “I don’t need to search the house to tell you who took the painting.” Who took the painting?\n  choice: Dale Clark\n  choice: Lucy Smith\n  choice: Daisy Morris\n  choice: Iain Potts\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: When Merv Weiss called me in on the Great Candy Cane Caper, I wasn’t exactly striped with enthusiasm. His sons, the Weiss boys, or the Three Weiss Men as they were other wise known in the neighborhood, had a well-earned reputation for being a cantankerous lot. But their father was an old friend, and I’d shopped at his hardware store for over forty years. So, I put my other cases on hold for a day, while I looked into the theft of Merv’s giant candy cane. “Hello, Ronald,” I said, as I pushed through the front doors of the store. “Uh-huh,” the oldest of Merv’s three sons grumbled in reply. Ronald was manager of the Outdoors department, and presently he was having one heck of a time lifting an elf garden gnome off the floor. His over-ample stomach kept getting in the way, his woefully thin arms trembling with the effort of hefting the cast-concrete weight. “Let me give you a hand with that,” I volunteered. Ronald heaved to his feet and watched as I easily scooped up the fifty-pound elf and deposited him in a nearby wheelbarrow for safe and easy transport. The man grunted something like thanks, and then trundled off in the direction of his department with his cargo. “Don’t tell me my father hired you to ‘investigate’ the disappearance of that stupid candy cane of his?” That was Michael Weiss, youngest of the Three Weiss Men. He came limping up to me with a look as unfriendly as his brother’s. “Yes,” I replied, “I’m-” “What a waste of money!” the man exclaimed, throwing up his hands. “If he’d let me light up the outside of the store like I’d asked, we wouldn’t have this problem.” Michael was in charge of the store’s Electrical department – lights, fixtures and all things conductive wire-related. He was just as tall as Ronald, but much thinner. “You wanted to string some Christmas lights?” I said. He snorted. “I could’ve made this place brighter than the North Star! But Dad insisted on blowing the Christmas promotional budget on a twenty-foot-long candy cane.” “Okay, that’ll be enough, son.” That was my old friend, Merv, emerged from his office to greet me. Michael tossed his hands into the air in another display of exasperation and limped off down an aisle towards his department. “Is his leg still bothering him, Merv?” I asked. “Yes, it hasn’t fully healed since he got tangled up in that spool of wire a month ago and pulled a hamstring.” I glanced out the door, just as Merv’s third son, Frank, drove up and parked at the curb in front of the store. “Frank’s got a new car, I see.” Merv looked that way, and nodded. “Yes, a hybrid. It is environmentally friendly. How he fits all of his family in there, I have no idea.” The father of six managed the store’s Power Tools department. He nodded curtly at his dad and me as he came through the doors, then walked off in the direction of his section of the store. “Let’s go into my office,” Merv said. “I’ve got something to show you.” Merv’s office was little more than a cubbyhole, jammed full of stuff like his store was. A computer monitor sat on a pile of papers on his desk, and he directed my attention to the screen. “This is the surveillance video from last night – when the candy cane was stolen. I only have the one camera at the front of the store.” He shrugged his shoulders. “It’s all I can afford. And besides, this is still a pretty good neighborhood.” We stared at a black and white picture of the dimmed store interior, long after closing time. A huge candy cane was clearly visible at the front of the store, lying on its side, elevated at the curly end, like some giant Christmas bandy stick. “Kids loved it,” Merv said, shrugging again. “I was going to have a drawing for it on Christmas Eve.” Everything appeared calm and quiet in the store, like the night before Xmas. Until, suddenly, a man strode briskly into camera range – a man dressed in a Santa suit, complete with furry cap, black boots, white beard and overstuffed stomach. “Clever disguise,” I commented. “There’s no way to make out his face or true physique in that costume.” Merv nodded, as the not-so-jolly Saint Nick shoved the curly end of the giant cane off its platform and onto the floor. He then picked up the kids’ candy dream by its curl and dragged it off out of the picture. “That’s it?” “That’s it,” Merv said. “Not much to go on, is it?” Brent Pearson stuck his head into the office. “Okay if I order those sinks we were talking about, Merv?” Brent was in charge of the Plumbing department. That, and the fact he was younger and a half-inch shorter than the Three Weiss Men, led them to call him ‘the little plumber boy’. “Sure,” Merv replied. “Great. I’ll drive over and pick them up in my van later today.” “Want a mint?” I said, pulling a roll out of my pocket and offering one to Brent. “No, thanks. I’m diabetic, remember?” “Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.” Brent went about his business and Merv and I walked to the back of the store, out onto the loading dock. “That thieving Claus must have dragged my candy cane out here, loaded it into something big enough to haul a twenty-foot, hundred-pound treat away,” Merv commented. “I’m guessing Father Christmas didn’t come down the chimney. So how’d he get in?” Merv looked down. “That’s the thing. The store was locked up tight, and there is no sign of a forced entry.” I whistled. “So, it is an inside job.” Merv nodded disconsolately. “That’s why I haven’t called in the police. All of my boys and Brent have keys to the store, and individual keys to their own departments. They shutter off their sections of the store at the end of the day and lock them, and then I lock the store itself.” I mulled that over, staring down at the cement-loading platform myself. I noticed something, and kneeled down, ran a wetted fingertip over a thin line of red and white shavings, tasted them. “Sweet.” I stood up and looked at Merv. “Well, old friend, I know who played bad Santa – took, instead of gave. And I know how he got away with the candy cane, too. It wasn’t with the help of eight tiny reindeer.” Who stole the candy cane?\nAnswer:",

It did not ring. “For heaven’s sake, Poirot, what’s the matter?” Captain Hastings ventured. “It’s this jewel robbery. I read about it in the Times,” Poirot said, tossing the paper to Captain Hastings. He missed, and the efficient Miss Lemon retrieved the newspaper from the floor and passed it to Captain Hastings. “Ah yes,” Hastings said, “It was quite a robbery. The Majeska Emeralds, no less. Some lesser stuff, but a ring from that very collection. What’s the matter, Poirot?” “The matter, as you call it, is that the telephone does not ring. It just sits there, mocking me. Why hasn’t Chief Inspector Japp called me to solve the case!” Drumming his fingers, he added, “And why would the Countess not have worn this ring at her own reception? It is not logical. Not logical at all!” I knew about this little exchange because later, when we discussed the case, Captain Hastings told me all about it, over glasses of bitter at a companionable pub. And I was glad to tell him how the case was solved. It was my first month on the job as a newly minted Scotland Yard detective. I was dealing with thefts, mostly, and had spent weeks talking with every pawnshop owner in London. That’s why I was ready when Chief Inspector Japp called me into his office. He was thoughtful and determined. “We’re going to solve this theft before that Belgian, Hercule Poirot, gets his ‘little grey cells’ in an uproar,” he said, slapping his desk (and hurting his hand) for emphasis. “You, Bob Starett, have until tomorrow at noon to break the case. I mean,” he amended his prior statement, ”you have until tomorrow at noon to find the facts that will enable me to solve the case.” I could tell by the look on his face that he looked forward to telling Poirot about his triumph. He might even call Poirot before he informed the Commissioner! Hastings gave me a detailed inventory of the jewelry that had been stolen from Countess Majeska, wife of the Polish Ambassador, two days ago. There had been a ball at the Embassy Residence. In addition to some jewelry of lesser value, a ring engraved with the initial M in Gothic script had been stolen from her private quarters during the course of the ball. The Countess had fortunately worn the other emeralds from her collection, including an elegant necklace, bracelet and Princess Ring. This was information that I had read in the newspapers.\t\t\nHastings told me a secret, which let me know that I was in his confidence. “The ring that was stolen was paste! That’s the funny thing. We concocted a story, Count Majeska and I, and fed it to the gullible press. The paste copy was put in the jewelry case with the real gems when it was taken from the vault. The real ring was left in the vault, don’t you see. Maybe that will bring the ring to light!” I blinked in astonishment, and then reviewed what was known. The thief was evidently someone who knew the residence. He or she must have been a personal friend, and not just a colleague or business acquaintance. I got on the job immediately, of course. After six calls, I located the pawnshop where an emerald ring with the initial M engraved on it had been pawned yesterday. As a matter of fact, Jimmy (of Jimmy’s Reputable Pawn Emporium) had called me. There had been an inexperienced clerk on duty the previous afternoon, who had muddled all of the pawned items, and not kept the precise records that the law requires. Jimmy was calling me to cut his losses, so to speak. He had seen the newspaper account, and suspected that one of the pawned items was from the Majeska theft. Pointing at the clerk, Jimmy began, “The trouble is,” he said, “that this idiot can’t remember who pawned what. He just couldn’t be bothered to do the records properly.” Jimmy called me aside. “And the devil of it is, one of the rings is paste! Not worth one tenth of what we loaned for it!” I assumed a calm demeanor, which I didn’t feel, believe me. I also winked a knowing wink at him, which let him know that I was aware of that fact all along. “Well, let’s see. Probably it isn’t as bad as all that.” I hoped to coax the young man out of his terror. “Tell me what you remember.” Sam Jurgens, the young clerk, thought a bit. He coughed, put on his most serious expression, and began. “There were four people who pawned rings yesterday.” His records did indicate that, but the appalling fact was that the only description for each one was “jeweled ring,” nothing more or less. Further, they were all rather valuable. One couldn’t tell them apart by the sums of money that each person received with each ring as collateral for the loan. I could see that Jimmy would have problems with this clerk. Imagine running a business this slipshod way! “The four people were -- let’s see: Alan Harrison, George Smythe, Herbert Grosvenor, and Evelyn Johnston.” I nodded. Now we were getting somewhere. All four were on the list that Chief Inspector Japp had developed of guests at the Majeska ball, who were personal friends of the Ambassador and his wife, and therefore would have some knowledge of their private quarters. In addition to the Majeska ring, an ornate emerald ring with the telltale initial M in Gothic script on the underside, there was a striking ruby ring with diamonds, a yellow diamond ring set in platinum and a diamond ring set with a cluster or perfect natural pearls. Clearly I had much to learn, as they all looked real to me. Any one of them might be worth many times my salary, for several months at least! Except the paste one, of course, whichever one it was. “Let’s try to sort it out, Sam,” I said. “I suppose you heard some tales of woe when the objects were pawned?” “Well, yes. They all gave a story of hard times, temporary of course, and the need for some ready cash to tide them over until better times came.” “Clients often do that, while they are waiting for their money,” Jimmy offered. “Any particular comments, about the rings themselves?” “Yes, detective, now that you mention it. Why, George Smythe said that his ring had been in his family for several generations. His grandmother had even worn it,” Jurgens remembered, “when she was presented at Court.” “But you don’t remember which one it was?” “No, sir.” He really looked glum. “And Alan Harrison?” “He was quite cheerful, actually. He said that he had won the ring at cards that morning, and now he was looking for some cash to pay off a stack of bills he had accumulated. I wish our other clients were as cheerful.” “Were the others also family heirlooms?” “One was. Evelyn Johnston said she had been left her ring by her cousin, though she never had an occasion to wear it. She was going to wear it at the Majeska Ball, she said, but would have been embarrassed to leave it here afterwards. Someone, after all, who had seen it at the ball might have recognized it, and guessed the fact that she was having a hard go of it.” “Sounds quite reasonable. And the other one?” “That was Herbert Grosvenor, sir. He was a very sad and solemn man. He just wanted someone to talk to, it seemed. He told me that at the Majeska Ball, he planned to become engaged. It was a new ring, bought for the occasion. But at the proper moment, the lady informed him she was not interested. He was crushed, and never even got to show her the ring,” Jurgens recalled. “He also said that he wasn’t sure whether he would bother picking it up again. It certainly had brought him terrible luck.” Sam Jurgens reported to Chief Inspector Japp. “I think, sir, that if you pursue the person I suspect, you will be led directly to the criminal who stole the Majeska jewels. It will make a good story when you present the facts to Hercule Poirot!” Who stole the jewels?\nAnswer:",

            "John Webster explained to everyone that Bob Turkle, the blacksmith, had no motive, as he’s a patriot. Why would he want to steal the gun and hurt his cause?”\n\n“Tom Wise, the fishmonger,” Webster continued, “is simply not big and strong enough to handle such a large ordnance. And Paul Rhodes, the baker, has a limp. He also couldn’t have shifted it.”\n\nHe pointed to the captain. “Arrest him. He moved the cannon.”\n\nThe captain appeared grim and the constable looked confused. “He couldn't move that heavy thing alone,” the constable insisted. “It would take at least five men with block and tackle.”\n\nJohn smiled. “Peter gave me the idea. This is how the captain did it: The ancient Greeks used ocean tides to lower and lift enormous weights from their ships,” John explained. “Captain Parker used the same principle to move the cannon.”\n\nThe constable laughed. “Then where did he carry it John, and how come nobody saw him?”\n\nJohn pointed past the docks. “It's still on the ship, constable.”\n\nJohn explained how he had checked the draft numerals yesterday when the ship first docked and when Peter had asked him about the numerals he noticed that they were the same today. The cannon had to still be on the ship.\n\nCaptain Parker had stalled at sea until he knew that a very high tide was going to occur. That was the night of the theft. By attaching a single pulley – well oiled to prevent noise – to the overhanging lifting arm, running a chain through it with one end attached to the cannon and the other to a cleat beneath the stack of iron, he had a hydraulic lifting device.\n\nBy waiting until the ship was almost at its lowest point and then attaching the chain, the cannon was only raised enough to swing it over the hatch. Since the distance from the cannon’s resting place on deck to the top of the iron pile was only a few feet, it was lowered easily when the tide started raising the ship.\n\nWhile the captain was waiting for this to occur, he removed the oilcloth and also enough iron brick to create a hole for the cannon to be secreted in. When the transfer was complete he simply piled the brick back over the cannon and replaced the oilcloth. A cursory inspection around the perimeter of the iron pile would reveal nothing.\n\n“Well done, Peter,\" his father said. \"Ten more minutes and the captain would have removed the blacksmith’s iron from the outside of the pile, changing the weight and hiding the difference from us.”\n\nJohn Webster stared at the captain a moment before speaking. “Captain Parker, I don't know why you did it, but I suspect it was to sell to the British for a profit.”\n\nPeter felt great. Even though he knew that his father had solved the mystery, he had helped a little."

        "inputs": "Story: Ed Pederson owned and operated the Village Clock Shop for over 40 years. And when his wife passed away, Ed spent even more time in his shop. … Too much time, some might say. It was an unpleasant surprise when Ed found his store in disarray after 7:00 a.m. one bitterly cold morning in January. Upon inspection, Ed learned that a thief had broken in the back door. The burglar’s plan would have been to steal money from the brass plated, old-fashioned cash register in the middle of the shop. However, the intruder did not realize that Ed emptied the contents of the cash drawer every night. Ed took extra precaution to protect his business, and hid the money for bank deposit in a floor safe underneath the antique roll top desk in his small office. The thief had done a fair amount of damage. Besides the damaged rear door, there were table and mantle clocks strewn about on the shop floor. There was also a broken display case. To make matters worse, a mouse had bitten into a lamp cord in the front shop area and Ed had to reset the circuit breaker to get the electricity back on. Ed noticed that three of his clocks and two watches were no longer running. It was a source of pride for Ed that the greatest majority of the clocks and watches in his shop worked properly at all times. Of course, he would often find one or two in need of winding or battery replacement, but this was a tiny percentage of the more than 200 clocks and watches in the store. He was careful to sell only the pieces that kept accurate time, regardless of the age and skill level needed to maintain them. Before calling the police, Ed noted the times on the clocks and watches that had stopped working. One watch and one of the clocks not working were on the floor, knocked over by the intruder in his nervous and angry haste. The other two clocks and watch remained in their normal places, apparently undamaged. However, Ed knew from previous experience that something as mild as a door slamming in the small shop would often cause one of his old clocks or watches to stop running. Ed discovered that a grandfather clock manufactured in 1929 had stopped running at 10:10 p.m., a little over an hour after he went home the previous evening. An early 20th century mantle clock which he found on the floor was stopped at 10:59 p.m., and an office clock mounted on the wall with a 1955 manufacturing stamp on the back of it was frozen at 2:01 a.m. A 1970s era battery-operated wristwatch, which was on the floor, had quit running at 3:18 a.m., and a beautiful old silver pocket watch from the 1880s was stuck at 5:22 a.m. Ed surveyed the damage. Numbly, by habit, he placed a new battery in the wristwatch and it began ticking. He set it to the current time: 7:29 a.m. Ed knew the intruder was in the shop between the hours of 10:10 p.m. and 5:22 a.m. Cursing silently, (as he chastised himself for not having a burglar alarm installed) he called the police department. It was a few minutes after 8 o’clock when his old friend, Detective Wesley Bingham, arrived at the shop. Ed poured hot coffee for both of them. Detective Bingham knew his friend well and realized that Ed would have a detailed assessment of what happened. Wisely, he allowed the older man to speak without interfering with questions. Ed began, “Some time between 10:10 last night and 5:22 this morning, somebody broke into the shop. Whoever it was broke down the back door and entered the front area. Perhaps because he needed to leave the lights off, he knocked several objects over and broke a display case. He must have been nervous, in a hurry and very angry after he saw the cash register drawer open and empty.” Bingham sipped on his coffee and replied, “Please continue.” “Nothing is missing,” Ed told him, “but three clocks and two watches were not running this morning. They were all stopped at different times. I suspect one of them quit running when the thief broke down the door or broke the display case.” Ed relayed to the detective the timepieces and respective times they had quit working. Bingham thought for a moment, and then asked, “Tell me what you observed about each timepiece.” Ed warmed to his topic. He was coming down from the initial shock of finding his beloved clock store vandalized. The hot coffee and comforting presence of old friend helped him organize his thoughts. He began to think out loud. “The grandfather clock sits in the corner, over there.” Ed pointed to the corner farthest from the cash register and broken display case. “There are no signs of visible damage, the clock appears normal. Obviously, it was not in thief’s path of destruction. The burglar would have to really shake the place for the grandfather clock to stop. Normally, the only time such a clock stops is if the weights and chains are tangled.” Bingham asked, “What about the mantle clock?” Ed replied, “The mantle clock was on the floor. It took a pretty good lick. There’s a dent in the wooden floor, but it’s made of heavy brass and only has a slight scratch. I have to accept a little bit of blame for that one being on the floor. I was looking at it last night just before going home and left it sitting too close to the edge of the counter. I found that it needs a cleaning. I guess I will do that today and look for damage.” Ed poured a second cup of coffee for both of them before continuing, “The pocket watch is in a display case by the front window. Nothing in that case was affected by my visitor … it’s too far from the center of the room.” He smiled and continued, “Pocket watches from the late 1800s are tough and were built to withstand horse and wagon rides.” Pulling it from the case, he showed it to the detective. “It’s made of silver, one of my favorites. I just rebuilt it last week.” Bingham smiled at his friend. It always pleased him that Ed had been blessed with a passion that allowed him to earn a living. He knew that Ed’s love of timepieces had sustained him since the death of his wife. Finally, he asked, “What about the other watch?” Ed said, “It does not appear to be damaged, even though it was on the floor. A new battery has it running just fine now.” Bingham asked, “How about the wall clock?” “That’s one of those commercial electric wall clocks from the 1950s,” Ed said. “The kind you used to see in offices everywhere. It still has its original cord and plug. However, it didn’t appear that the thief was anywhere near it.” Wesley Bingham answered, “Well, Ed, I have some news for you. A young man named Aubrey Behrens was arrested early this morning. One of your neighbors on the block saw him loitering on the sidewalk. He was arrested and brought to the station before you called. He has cuts and bruises on his hands and arms. His girlfriend was with him, and she swears they were together at her place just before their arrest. I need to know when Behrens was in the shop. I can tear their story apart and rattle him if I have a timeline on this breaking and entering.” Ed smiled and said, “Wesley, now that I have had time to think this through, I can give you the exact time that he was here.” When was Behrens in the shop?\n  choice: The mantle clock (stopped at 10:59 p.m.)\n  choice: The wristwatch (stopped at 5:22 p.m.)\n  choice: The pocket watch (stopped at 3:18 a.m.)\n  choice: The grandfather clock (stopped at 10:10 p.m.)\n  choice: The wall clock (stopped at 2:01 a.m.)\nAnswer:",

But, I stayed in the office late Friday and thought it through. Here are my conclusions:\n\n“On Tuesday, Peter entered the vault with a client. He escaped my view for a moment, but he was with a client and did not have his jacket on. The only thing he carried with him was the key to the lockbox, so it could not have been him for those reasons. Edward also entered the vault on Tuesday. He carried what appeared to be a duffel bag in with him, but did not have it when he came out. Obviously, he placed it in one of the temporary safes for a client. For sure, it would not fit in a four by six inch lockbox. I also know that James was in the vault with a client on Wednesday. Although I was on the telephone for part of the time he was in there, I know he would not be working our mystery challenge with a client by his side. I also know that Ronald was in the vault by himself just before closing time on Thursday. However, when entering, he turned right – away from lockbox no. 100 to the left.”\n\nEveryone now stared at Russell. All were smiling as Robert said, “So, it was you. I’m anxious to see what you placed in the box.”\n\n“Why are you so sure it was me who placed the item? You are going to look foolish if you are wrong.”\n\n“I’m not wrong. I’ve eliminated everyone else for the reasons stated. Besides, you entered wearing a suit coat and carrying a briefcase. You had ample room to hide an item. Plus, I strongly suspect that Peter helped you. He just happened to come to my office with a question while you were in the vault.”\n\nThe six men went to the vault and Robert opened lockbox 100 with the firm’s spare key. He found a small box of cheese crackers. A note inside read: Robert, Enjoy the crackers. You’ve earned them! Good job. -Russell Winwood"

Tom, a U.S. Army combat engineer, had been through many experiences in those 10 months. In addition to the constant threat of Viet Cong guerillas and the capable and dangerous North Vietnamese Army, he had survived a serious bout of amoebic dysentery and a nasty case of ringworm, as well as the filthy living conditions and lack of sleep, which most field enlisted men suffered. Tom was tired and run down, but had weathered the worst that Vietnam had to offer. One afternoon in late February, a box from his uncle arrived in company headquarters. In it, Tom found a large can of commercially packaged multi-flavored popcorn. He was delighted with the unexpected gift. He looked forward to eating the popcorn, but first, he had to go upstairs for guard duty. The guard tower was on top of the semi-underground bunker his squad lived in, or hooch, as such quarters were called. The hooch sat right up on the perimeter of the base camp with the concertina fence barely 10 feet away from the half buried rear wall. Guard duty was split into two-hour shifts, beginning at 1900 hours (7:00 p.m.) and ending at 0700 hours (7:00 a.m.). Tonight, Tom was on from 1900 until 2100 hours. Guard duty on this night was uneventful. From high in the guard tower, he could see everything in front of him and everything in back on his side of the base camp. During his shift, he saw Henson head out toward the NCO club on the other side of the compound. Henson had with him only the sidearm pistol he was allowed as a non-commissioned officer. Mac walked towards the recreation area, carrying a duffel bag of baseballs and bats used during pickup games. Locke, the last to leave, walked away from the squad’s area with his M-16 rifle, but Tom could not tell where he went. He lost sight of him when a rice farmer and his water buffalo got too close to the wire directly below him. Tom’s relief arrived right at 2100 and Tom climbed down the ladder he had helped build several months before to enter the hooch. The tropical sun was just going down and he thought about how hot it could be in Vietnam at any time of day — even as late as midnight. But Tom’s focus turned quickly to the memory of the popcorn his Uncle Ross had sent. He planned to munch on it while writing a letter home. Entering the hooch and walking to his bunk, Tom noticed the can of popcorn missing. He also noticed water on the floor. There were a few kernels of the cheese flavored scattered in the aisle. The hooch was unusually clean as there were no empty soft drink or beer cans lying around. He also saw his buddies, Mosier, Henson, Macnamara and Locke, huddled close to his bunk with sheepish expressions on their faces. He thought it odd that they were back in the hooch on a hot evening at 2100. Annoyed, he asked, “Come on! What have you guys done with my popcorn?” Locke, the newest member of the squad, said simply, “I haven’t seen it.” Macnamara answered calmly, “Last I saw it, it was by your bunk.” Henson, Tom’s best friend, said nothing. And Mosier looked down at his feet, avoiding eye contact with Tom altogether. These fellows were all good friends and had been through a lot together. Tom did not believe they had been mean-spirited in taking his popcorn. One or all of them had given into the temptation of the moment, and had taken the opportunity to enjoy some stateside snack food. Tom White couldn’t blame them, and so, he was not angry. However, he did want to know the truth. The guys were being coy with him, and he realized this was now a game they were playing. “OK, guys. If I figure this out, will the guilty one admit it?” They men all grinned and agreed. Henson, with beer on his breath, belched, “Tom, it was only one of us that took your popcorn. He’s already been dressed down and will return what is left of it with an apology – after you figure out which of us took it, that is.” Tom, smirking, began thinking out loud, “OK, then. I brought the package down here from the mail office just before evening chow. Then we all went to chow before I headed directly up to the guard tower. So, one of you took it while I was on guard duty.” “So far, so good,” Macnamara replied. “OK, Mac, what did you do after chow?” “… Wrote a letter home, and then went to play ball with B squad.” “Locke, how about you?” “I went to the other side of the camp to watch the movie.” There was always an outdoor movie, at night, down by the enlisted men’s and NCO clubs. Tom White did not think late night movies were a wise idea, and he was proven right a few weeks earlier when the Viet Cong zeroed in on the movie screen after dark, and dropped a dozen mortars into the assembled audience. Tom though it odd that Locke took his M-16 with him to the movie, but knew that, as the newest member of the squad, he was still nervous about being in a war zone. He said nothing about seeing him with his rifle. Instead, he asked, “What did you see? Locke replied, Buena Sera, Mrs. Campbell. White looked the new man over. He knew that Gina Lollobrigida starred in that film and was one of the G.I.’s favorites. He looked over to his good buddy Henson. “Ron, how about you?” Ron answered, “I had a couple of beers down at the club.” Tom nodded, and turned to Dicky, “Mosier, what’s your story?” “I went to the showers. I washed my clothes.” Tom replied, “That’s it?” Mosier answered, “That’s it.” Tom looked at his guilty buddy. He smiled and the guilty buddy did, too. He asked modestly, “Well … did you eat it all?” Who stole the popcorn?\n  choice: Private Joe Locke\n  choice: Specialist Fourth Class Patrick Macnamara\n  choice: Private First Class Dicky Mosier\n  choice: Specialist Fifth Class Ron Henson\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: There was a crime, and I was worried. And I was always worried about an acrobat named Lorenzo. He was my father, and he'd exercised every day until his slender body was covered with muscles. He was stuck in the bottom row of the pyramid, the acrobat supporting the other gymnasts who stood on his shoulders. More acrobats stood on their shoulders, and more on theirs … and then a clown knocked them all down. Our circus high-wire star earned twice as much money as the acrobats. After two years of hard practice, my father still hadn't earned a spot on the high-wire team. He was stuck on the ground with the tumblers, performing each night in their routines without a break for three solid hours. Tonight I saw disappointment in his face as the spotlight focused high above him on a wire strung from the circus tent poles. And that's when the crime happened. That same night our circus had received an angry visit from the town's sheriff. \"Your freaks don't belong here,\" he'd said fiercely. Lorenzo had watched with shame and anger as the sheriff bellowed, \"Circus people steal. And you're creepy looking, too. Get out of our village now!\" \"We received this permit months ago,\" said our ringmaster with laughter and warmth. \"And an honorable man like yourself wouldn't want to disappoint your 3,000 neighbors sharing a friendly evening with our circus family.\" The sheriff demanded a look at the permit and a chance to inspect the facilities, insisting that each customer in this dangerous place meant more work for his department on a Sunday night. The ringmaster continued flattering the sheriff, knowing we couldn't afford to cancel the Sunday show. It was an almost magical tradition – each weekend no matter how much money the circus earned, exactly one-third of that amount came from the Sunday crowds. But now the tight-wire had broken, and one of our performers was falling towards the ground! It was a 100-foot drop, and the audience gasped, but Lorenzo and I felt even more frightened. The falling man was the “Great Marchelli\" -- the proudest member of our circus family. We watched as Marchelli leaned his falling body forward. Suddenly he grabbed his knees and somehow hurled his legs over his head, doing an erratic somersault in the air. As he tried to propel his body into the safety net, he fell and missed! But Marchelli, being great, quickly stretched his arm out, grabbing desperately for the net's edge as he fell. The net stretched tight, stopping Marchelli's fall, and as the net sprung back into position, Marchelli used its momentum to hurl himself up into another confident somersault. He landed gracefully in the net on one knee, his arms stretched proudly. Marchelli glowed with pride and even arrogance. He spent his childhood in the circus, never learning to read or write, so he took an extra pride in his great performing skills. It was the ringmaster who was most concerned. With the sheriff arguing that circus people were crooks, he'd wanted to look organized and in control. And because the ringmaster was afraid of heights himself, he was most proud of the circus high-wire act. He shouted praise to the audience about the Great Marchelli. He added that circus life was full of excitement and surprises, and its trained experts were ready for anything. Though, his excitement would disappear when he found out he had been robbed. When the crowds left for the night, Zelda, the fortune teller, removed her wig of wild dark hair, and put on a pair of glasses. Privately she was proud of her ability with math, and she wanted everyone to know they could rely on her numbers. \"Lorenzo needs to buy gifts for his family!\" said the ringmaster with a smile, walking with my father into her trailer. But during the circus's performance, the money had been stolen. \"And there's something even stranger,\" Zelda said honestly. \"They didn't steal all of it!\" The money was locked in metal boxes, and every day in her book Zelda recorded the amount in each box before handing them over to the ringmaster on Sunday nights. After she'd reviewed the figures in her mysterious black book, she'd reached her startling conclusion. \"They stole some of our money?\" the ringmaster asked, genuinely puzzled. \"But why?\" \"The thief left us a note,\" Zelda replied, pulling a folder piece of paper from one metal box, sitting empty on her desk. It read: I took what you owed me. Tonight the wire will snap. \"That's our money!\" shouted Lorenzo angrily, as the ringmaster eyed him with suspicion, \nrecalling Lorenzo's eagerness to join the high-wire act. \"It wasn't me,\" Lorenzo protested as we left. \"Maybe the Great Marchelli sabotaged his own act, determined to steal the spotlight one more time!\" I wondered if Marchelli had a plan that was even more wicked. Maybe he'd faked that spectacular fall, just to cast suspicion on my father. That would ensure that my father would never be promoted into his place. Zelda wailed that she'd guarded the money carefully. \"The money could only have been stolen after the circus started -- and even then I was only gone for minutes to get our permit for the sheriff.\" Did the sheriff ask you himself? \"No,\" she said hesitantly. \"The ringmaster sent me to retrieve it from his desk in the front wagon.\" Her eyes focused, deep in thought, as she tried to imagine what happened in that time. Had his worries over profitability forced him to \"steal\" some money to hide it from his employees? We opened her book of numbers: Friday: $3927 \nSaturday: $8073 \"I didn't even get to finish calculating the numbers for Sunday! Zelda wailed. Was there anyone who was owed money? \"No!\" Zelda exclaimed. \"Everyone is paid equally, and always at the end of the week!\" she sighed. \"The ringmaster insists that each one of us be treated the same – except Marchelli, who gets a double share. There are 99 of us, and Marchelli's extra share makes it an even 100.\" On Friday and Saturday there were two boxes: One for the ticket sales before 3:00 p.m., and then one for the remainder of the day. But on Sundays, Zelda kept all of the day's money in a single box. One of the boxes was missing, and there were four boxes remaining with the following amount of money: $1817 \n$4012 \n$2110 \n$4061 \"Call the sheriff,\" I said. \"I know who stole your money. And I also know who is responsible for cutting Marchelli’s rope!” Who stole the money?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: All Centerville was in mourning when John Plympton died. He was a banker who knew everyone and had helped many people over the years. For forty years he had authorized loans that more conservative lenders wouldn’t have granted. Then, after he retired, he was known locally as something of a soft touch, particularly after he lost his wife. Helping people became more than a hobby. It was almost a reason for him to keep living. Why, some people even speculated that if he kept it up, he wouldn’t have much to leave to his only grandchild, Simon Plympton, who lived with his wife Susan at the old Plympton residence on Maple Street. I suppose that view was shared by Simon and Susan, whose style of living was quite frugal, tending to show that they had to stretch their meager resources. They were pleased to live with John Plympton, whom they genuinely admired, and grateful that the arrangement was rent-free. “Some day, after all, you’ll own this property, Simon,” John would say. And he was always a man of his word. I had been sent to interview John Plympton for a local interest feature story. It was known that he wasn’t feeling very well, so my editor at the Chronicle wanted to record something of his life and times while that was still possible. This would be under my regular byline, Richard Harding Davis. It wasn’t for the sports pages, so the full moniker, not Crusher Davis, which was how they ran my stories on the sports pages, would be used. It certainly wasn’t appropriate for the Ask Martha column I write, largely advice for the lovelorn. John Plympton was glad to see me, and he reminisced about my family, whom he had known for several generations. I suppose I share the prejudices of most young people, believing that older people’s talk can be tedious. But that wasn’t the case with John Plympton. He was fascinating as he talked about our town and how it had grown and expanded, the families that he had known and the celebrities that had visited here. Why, Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth had once played an exhibition baseball game here, when they were barnstorming after spring training on their way to start the official season in New York! “They signed that baseball for me,” the old man said with a sparkle in his eye. “I was there and saw the game. I was ten years old.” He nodded towards a baseball trophy in a plastic case on his display shelf, near the wardrobe closet. I walked over and looked at it. Sure thing, both baseball legends had clearly signed the baseball, and one of them had dated it, April 2, 1931. I thought for a minute. “That’s the year they tied for leading the American League in home runs, at 46 each!” His face shone with pleasure. “Good for you. That baseball ought to go to someone who will appreciate it. I’ll make sure that it’s yours when I’m gone, if you’d like to have it, Crusher!” “IF I wanted it!” It would be a treasure, even though there was a third signature on the ball, clearly visible - Jackie Mitchell. It was probably some kid who had seen the great Ruth and Gehrig play and just wanted to link his name to theirs by signing the same baseball. “I appreciate it very much, Mr. Plympton. But you’ve got many years left.” At that point, his nurse, Melinda Baker, entered the room to say that Dr. Edgar Newton had just arrived. So I took my leave, as Dr. Newton entered the room. He was the dean of our local physicians, a solid man, but deaf as a post. The interview wasn’t complete, so Mr. Plympton smilingly agreed to see me again in a few days. “Then you can tell me how you got that ‘Ask Martha’ byline,” he said with a twinkle in his eye. “But, I think that the baseball will be of greater interest to Crusher Davis.” Clearly, Centerville had few secrets from John Plympton. I returned the baseball to its place on the display shelf and left the room. I returned as arranged for our second interview. John Plympton was weaker, but he had a merry glint in his eye. Susan Plympton was in the room reading to him, but she rose and left as I entered the room. Melinda Baker, the nurse, was plumping the old man’s pillows to make him more comfortable. Then she hovered at her nurse’s station near the wardrobe, anxious to see that her patient did not become overly tired. He noticed my eager expression. “I see you have done some research about that baseball.” I had indeed. First, I had started off by Googling Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig autographed baseballs, then the year 1931. I don’t know why, but I added the name Jackie Mitchell to the mix. Bingo! It turned out that Jackie Mitchell was a 17-year-old girl and a fabulous left-handed pitcher. Pitching for the Chattanooga Lookouts, a Class AA Southern League team with whom she had just signed a contract as the first female athlete in organized professional baseball, she had actually faced Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in an exhibition game - and struck them both out! With a wicked sweeping curve ball that broke over the plate low and was virtually unhittable - she had learned from their Memphis neighbor, the future Major League pitcher Dazzy Vance - she had her moment of fame. Then Commissioner of Baseball Landis barred women from playing professional baseball. But she was always known as a pitcher of great ability. I couldn’t begin to think what a baseball signed by Ruth, Gehrig and Mitchell on that day would be worth. It could be worth as much as $50,000 to a collector. It was surely the only one in existence! “You’re the only one who knows the story of that baseball,” he said. “My family was never very interested. By the way, my lawyer is coming here this afternoon, and I’ll make a codicil to my will, leaving the baseball to you, formal and proper.” But just a few hours later, after his luncheon, he took a nap, and it turned out to be his final one. When I next saw the room in which we had spoken, to retrieve a notebook that I had misplaced during the second interview, the baseball was gone. I asked Simon Plympton about it. “Never really noticed - Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig both signed the baseball, you say? Oh, yes, now I remember. Granddad did mention it. We’d better have a careful search.” His wife Susan was clearly the practical one in the family. “I’ll put together a list of visitors, that last day. You’ve probably heard that the Centerville Hospital gets most of the stocks and trust funds, while Simon inherited the house and furnishings. So the baseball is ours by rights. It’s bound to turn up somewhere.” But she didn’t seem very convinced that it would. As a matter of fact, she only became really interested when I shared with her the full story of the baseball and its three signatures. The visitors had been few that last day, and Simon, concentrating for a change, remembered seeing the baseball on the shelf after his Grandfather died. The Plymptons had been at luncheon in their dining room when the nurse had gently informed them that Mr. John Plympton had passed on. She then left at Susan Plympton’s request to call Dr. Newton from the downstairs study. He arrived shortly and conducted a perfunctory examination. His patient had died of natural causes, just worn out. Then the room had been closed, following the examination and removal by the Carter Funeral Home, when Simon had taken a last look at the room and its furnishings. No. He just couldn’t remember at that point whether the baseball was still there or not. There was no question of the autographed baseball going to me now, regardless of what John Plympton had wished. He hadn’t put it in writing, and when I raised the matter with Melinda Baker, she said that she just hadn’t paid attention to our conversation. She had medical matters to attend to. And there went my only witness to what he had wanted to do. That left the present whereabouts of the autographed ball a mystery. But knowing the town as I did, it wasn’t hard to find the ball. There it was, in the center window of Al’s Pawn Parlor and Sporting Goods Store. Ordinarily a pawned item would not be displayed so prominently, but Al told me that the person who pawned the baseball had received a lot of money, $5,000, and he doubted that the money would be repaid and the pledge redeemed. Since I knew the autographed baseball was worth at least ten times that sum, I knew the person who took it would be along shortly. It wasn’t hard for Crusher Davis to figure out who had pawned the baseball and was now anxiously trying to retrieve it. Who pawned the baseball?\n  choice: Melinda Baker\n  choice: Susan Plympton\n  choice: Dr. Edgar Newton\n  choice: Simon Plympton\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: Zeb pulled his coat tight against the cold rain, and then saw the restaurant. It was two days before Christmas, Dec. 23, 1814. Lightning flashed over the Gulf of Mexico, revealing five enormous sails fluttering in the wind. Everyone knew the ships were there to attack. “Molly's,” read a large sign swinging in the rain. Zeb pushed open the door. He heard the townspeople of New Orleans gabbing excitedly while they ate. “I'm loading my shotgun!” “That'll scare the British away.” “We've captured hundreds of their ships.” “They burned Washington.” “ ‘We,’ ‘they’ – you’re all just men stuffing your fat faces,” Molly said, delivering a plate of hot sausage. There was laughter and shouts as the restaurant's hefty owner brought their meals, but not one familiar face, Zeb noted. “Maybe they're not British ships,” joked Marie, a small waitress. “Maybe Napoleon wants us back!” Eleven years earlier New Orleans belonged to the French, until their emperor sold the territory to President Thomas Jefferson as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Zeb searched the faces looking for the man who could help him, but Molly's small restaurant was filled only with the people of the town, their voices filled with excitement. Then the door opened, and in walked Ezekiel, his long scraggly hair still wet from the rain. He seemed just as anxious to get out of the cold. “Did you see the sails?” Ezekiel asked, looking worried. Zeb nodded. “General Jackson saw them too,” Ezekiel whispered. “But we have a problem.” Zeb scanned the faces in the restaurant. The British had already seized control of the shoreline ten miles south of New Orleans. The city's population was less than 40,000, and now foreign soldiers were preparing to invade. Andrew Jackson was preparing a defense. He had fortified his own troops with Choctaw Indians, pirates from Barataria Bay, 500 African-American soldiers and militias from Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Before the British could invade and to give his men time to prepare the defense, Jackson would send his troops to attack them. Tonight. “But the British will know he's coming.” Lightning struck outside. “How?” Zeb asked. “Someone just spotted the troop movements through the swamp, and is planning to meet the British commander here tonight. They're going to deliver the warning in a letter,” Ezekiel explained. “If the British receive it, Jackson's surprise attack will fail.” Zeb carefully scanned the crowd again. “What do they want with New Orleans?” Marie teased. “The Mississippi river!” yelled a burly sailor. “And everything west of it!” Someone in this restaurant had been sent ahead to warn the British. But who? “They ate President Madison's dinner!” “And burned his house!” “I heard Davy Crockett himself fought alongside General Jackson.” “What do we need Davy Crockett for when we've got your shot-gun?” Zeb and Ezekiel searched for suspects, and one face stood out in the crowd. The burly sailor sat across from a wealthy-looking man in a leather vest, wearing a wide, stylish hat. A pirate? Zeb and Ezekiel approached his table, and asked if they could join him for dinner. His name was Jean, and he readily agreed. “ ‘Tis too cold a night to deny you the warmth of my fine company,” Jean said grandly. Ezekiel asked casually what his line of business was. “I'm a privateer,” Jean said with a laugh. He reached slyly into his jacket pocket and pulled out a yellow parchment. “It’s signed by the U.S. Congress itself. I'm authorized to plunder the British ships!” He roared with laughter. “Don't you dare call him a pirate,” said Jean's companion, a sailor named Smith. “Marie, more rum!” shouted Jean. “Leave her alone!” shouted Molly protectively, pushing her thick spectacles back. “Marie's been working since noon.” Smith had arrived in Louisiana all the way from Maine, which would raise anyone's suspicion, since the New England states had threatened to secede. “Even if we are at war, money's money,” Smith said, patting down his wet hair. “There's money to be made in trading with Britain,” he added. “But me, I hate them. We beat them already, 36 years ago. Do we have to fight a second war of independence?” Molly delivered a warm plate to the sailor, piled high with slices of roast beef and steaming potatoes. Ezekiel leaned across the table and whispered a secret theory. “Maybe Molly is the British contact.” “They've already captured our gunboats,” Molly said to Smith with a laugh. “And it's so close to Christmas,” Smith joked back, drawing a big laugh from Jean the privateer. Molly leaned into the sailor's face, and said: “Standing so close to you, I can finally see your face, Mr. Smith. And it's an ugly one!” The sailor laughed loudly as Molly covered her spectacles in mock horror. Zeb and Ezekiel scanned the rest of the restaurant. It was getting late, and most of the other customers had left. One of the four people who remained was waiting for the British commander. “Read my letter from the U.S. Congress!” Jean said with a laugh. “It entitles me to plunder the British ships – and I don't even know how to read!” New Orleans would fall to the British unless Zeb and Ezekiel could identify their contact. Suddenly, the door swung open. A white-haired gentleman with a long, sharp nose had entered the restaurant, surveying the crowd and calling out for a meal. He said he was in a hurry. Ezekiel walked Zeb towards the door, then whispered: “Don't worry. I know who's delivering the warning letter to the British.” Who wrote the warning letter to the British?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: 94-year-old Harold Boyles was near death. His five children were with him at bedside on the last morning of his life. The years had not been kind to Harold. Since the death of his beloved wife Susie a decade ago, he had commenced a long and agonizing slide into Alzheimer’s disease. The family knew that his passing would be a blessing. But on this last morning in late winter, Harold was surprisingly lucid. He began to talk, and told his children of people and experiences they had never heard him speak of before. It seemed that Harold had mercifully been relieved of dementia in this short time before joining Susie in eternity. The children would later be thankful for and cherish this last quality time spent with their father. Less than an hour before Harold died, he said to his children, “They say a candle burns brightest before flickering out. That’s what I’m doing, flickering out. But, before I depart this life, I have something to tell you. I would have told you this long ago, but haven’t been quite able to.” It was the first time in many years the children had experienced their dad’s wry humor—something else to be thankful for on this day. But, he continued, “In the basement of the house there is an old steamer trunk back in the far corner, to the right of the entry way. It’s buried under a mountain of stuff Mom and I collected over the years, but you need to find it. Inside the trunk, there’s some information you need to know.” Dennis, the oldest of the Boyles children, asked, “What kind of information?” “Find the trunk and you’ll find out.” Harold refused to talk about it anymore and passed away peacefully a few minutes later. A couple of weeks later, the children met in their childhood home to find the trunk. They were not certain it even existed, as Harold’s memory was not to be trusted, but they could not chance assuming he imagined the “information you need to know.” After digging through all the collected family debris in the basement, they finally found the steamer trunk Harold promised would be there. They dusted it off and carried it upstairs to open it in the dining room. The dining room table was big enough to accommodate whatever contents they would find in the old chest. At first glance, the contents of the trunk appeared to be insignificant. There were a couple of World War II era newspapers and a Life magazine with Eisenhower (then General Eisenhower) on the cover. There were a few old love letters Mom had saved which Harold had written to her in the thirties. There were a couple of prescription medicine pill bottles dated October, 1946 and a few pieces of cheap costume jewelry. And that was all, except for an envelope with a letter inside. It was addressed to Harold Boyles and postmarked August 25, 1969. Dennis opened the letter and read it aloud: Harold; You have a sick child. I know which one of them poisoned Ethel. I saw the poison being placed in the bottle of salad dressing she used. However, $10,000 will make this memory go away. Roscoe The five sat around the table in silence. If this letter from forty years ago was true, one of them was a murderer. Their Aunt Ethel died in 1968 from what was believed acute food poisoning. Uncle Roscoe had never remarried and they wondered if this was a letter from an embittered, heartbroken man. Still, it was not an accusation they could ignore. Dennis said, “I’m seventy years old and Patricia is the youngest at fifty-eight. Any of us could have murdered Aunt Ethel, if that is indeed what happened.” They continued to sit in stunned silence. Dennis said, “I remember when Auntie got sick. It was at the July Fourth pool party we had here. I thought it was odd that nobody else was affected, but we were later told that she was the only one who used salad dressing from the bottle that was spoiled. I recall now it was her special brand that nobody else liked. If what Uncle Roscoe claims is true, one of us had to have placed poison in the bottle in the kitchen before Mom took the food outside to the pool deck. There was no way to do it outside unnoticed.” George added, softly, “I remember that Aunt Ethel was not a nice person. She always scowled and lost her temper with us when Mom and Dad were not around.” “You saying one of us paid her back?” asked John, incredulously. “Could be.” Patrick, age sixty-eight, said, “Dad would not have kept this letter and pointed us to it if there was nothing to the accusation.” Patricia (Trish, as her brothers called her) said, “You know we can never rest until we figure this out.” She shuddered. “If true, this is terrible.” George, age sixty-five and recently retired, said, “I was the first to arrive that day. Remember, it was a cookout and swim party. I’ve always loved the pool and wanted to get here early for a private swim. The first thing I did when I got here was wave hello to Mom through the window in the kitchen. I saw Dad was with her. Then, after diving into the pool, I gashed my finger on the intake grill and spent the rest of the day with a bandage on my hand.” Patrick spoke next. “I arrived with my wife and our little Alice. George was already bandaged and not looking too happy. First we went to the kitchen to say hi to Mom and Dad. Mom was preparing the condiment tray. The spoiled bottle of dressing was with the other condiments, but it was sealed with the top screwed on.” Trish said, “I remember coming in through the backyard gate. I do recall seeing the condiment tray through the kitchen window—unattended on the kitchen table. Now, I did not go into the kitchen at any time that day. All of you should remember that as I was never by myself all day long. But, while I was looking in the window, Roscoe and Ethel walked up behind me and said hi. I turned around to greet them. I would bet that Roscoe saw somebody handle the salad dressing and later put two and two together.” John, sixty-one, and the quietest of the siblings, spoke next. “I was frying hamburgers outside. Roscoe and Ethel came over to me when they arrived and we visited for awhile. After a time, they went over to the pool area and I saw them speaking with Trish. I would agree that was probably when Roscoe saw something in the kitchen, because he was facing the window and, soon after that, the burgers were done so Mom brought the tray outside.” Dennis was the last to speak. He waited for a few long moments, collecting his memories from forty years ago. Finally, he said, “Well, my family and I arrived pretty much unnoticed, coming in through the back gate as Trish did and walking in just as Roscoe and Aunt Ethel were speaking with her. I noticed Alice getting ready to jump into the pool and Patrick’s wife was taking a seat by the pool. I knew she could not swim so I jumped in to play with Alice. We stayed in the pool until it was time to eat.” The next voice spoke quickly. Looking at the guilty sibling, the voice said, “I know you did this. Would you like to tell the rest of us why? Who is the murderer?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: Andersonville Military Prison, deep in the heart of Dixieland Georgia, was the most dreaded of Confederate prisoner-of-war camps. It was such a grim place that the rebel soldiers guarding it were fed and clothed little better than their 33,000 Yankee prisoners. From its inception in February 1864, until the Civil War’s end 14 months later, 13,000 prisoners would die; an astonishing 29% mortality rate. Many of the Union soldiers succumbed to starvation and exposure to the elements, but some were also murdered, as was the case with Private Glendenning Bryan. Sgt. Crosby, Sgt. Thornton, Pvt. Whisenant and Cpl. Horner shared a tent with Pvt. Bryan – if you could call a few small tree limbs that served as poles, plus a few tattered blankets and threadbare shirts, shelter at all. Because the tent was so small, privacy was virtually non-existent, and this only added to the shock and dismay when the friendly Bryan, a young 19-year-old from Boston, was found dead with a knife wound in his stomach when the sun came up early one steamy Monday morning in August 1864. Crosby, the 38-year-old no-nonsense senior non-commissioned officer and Chicago, Illinois, policeman, took charge. Speaking within the confines of the small tent, he said, “He’s murdered, murdered right here. I don’t know why, he would’ve been dead in a few days anyway.” Bryan had been in Andersonville the longest and was the most malnourished and sickest of the five. However, they soon discovered why Bryan had been killed. He had been hoarding food in his clothing, planning to eat it when he felt better. Inside his trousers they found a crudely sewn, hidden pocket that contained breadcrumbs and a few tiny pieces of salt pork. The likable Bryan had been killed for food. “Well, it wasn’t me that did it,” said the short-tempered Horner, another native of Massachusetts, as he viewed his friend who lay dead just inches from his bare feet. “My hands are useless with arthritis and I can’t hardly hold a knife.” Horner was 40-years-old and had spent too many years shoeing horses in the cold weather of his home in Worcester. “It couldn’t have been me,’ chimed in Thornton. “I was outside walking most of the night.” “Most of the night is not all of the night,” Crosby pointedly replied. Thornton, a 26-year-old librarian from Philadelphia and quietest of the residents of the tent, winced at this suggestion. “Did anyone see you?” asked Crosby. Thornton looked at each man in turn before answering, “Nobody saw me, but I was out walking last night. I was.” “I was sick, couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, so I was down by the sinks all night,” offered Whisenant, the normally amiable 30-year-old New York school teacher. “I got back here just a few minutes ago.” Crosby hadn’t slept in the tent the previous night, either, and told them so. “I was at the other end of the camp, trying to get what fresh night air was available.” That was an ironic statement, as it was known that the stench from Andersonville was so severe it was noticed in the city of Americus, several miles away. “I didn’t notice any of you fellers last night. Just me and Bryan,” said Horner, thinking out loud. Slowly, he asked, “Who owns the knife?” “Answer that and we have our killer,” Thornton added, dryly. For a few minutes they all sat in silence. Finally, Crosby said, “I got back here first. I found Horner asleep and Bryan dead.” Horner shot Crosby a mean look, pointed a gnarled finger at him and said, “I told you I didn’t kill him!” He winced in pain as he did so. “Easy, corporal, easy, I’m just thinking.” “Well, for whatever it’s worth to you, I didn’t sleep well,” Horner said. “Who does in this place? I was asleep for only an hour or two and did not see or hear anything, except the usual camp noises.” “OK, let’s continue,” said Crosby. “I was on the other side of the camp with various friends; not with any one person the entire night, but I was never alone.” Turning to Thornton, he asked, “What about you? Horner didn’t sleep well, says he didn’t see you.” “He probably didn’t. I only came back to the tent a couple of times. When I heard him snoring, I did not go in. I didn’t want to bother him. The last time was about an hour ago. It was too dark to notice anything unusual about Bryan.” Crosby digested this for a moment and then asked Whisenant, “You were sick last night?” “Right,” he replied. The sight and shock of the dead Bryan did nothing to quiet his queasiness, although he was a butcher by trade in his hometown of Zeeland, Michigan. With great effort, he managed to control a wave of nausea. He needed to go outside and Crosby excused him. Whisenant returned a few minutes later, weak but feeling better. He dreaded resuming the conversation, but he re-seated himself in the cramped tent and looked at Crosby. Finally, Crosby stated bluntly, “I know who killed Bryan.” Who is the killer?\nAnswer:",

Our mother, a very fast eater, had already finished her meal. It had been a hot day, and mother retired to bed early. Suddenly a scream came from her room. We all ran to it and asked, what happened? \"The necklace is gone!\", she wailed. \"The wedding gift! It`s disappeared!\" We all were silent for a long second, then everyone started talking at the same time. \"Oh my god...\" \"Sure am glad it was insured!\" \"No way!\" \"Oh dear someone comfort her......\" \"Poor mother...\" \"Poor necklace...\" \"What necklace?\" Dad shushed us and ushured us out of the room, staying inside to comfort mom. \"Who can have done that horrible thing?\", my younger sister Sarah said. She may have been younger but also bolder and more daring than me. I shrugged. \"It could be anyone.\" \"Then how about this; we can try to find out!\" \"That`s a great idea!\" I really liked her idea, though somewhat unsure about whether we could possibly do that. \"But how will we find out?\" Sarah opened her mouth to say something, but just then the door opened and dad came out. He made us all go to bed, and walked to the living room to finish his supper. He walked in a strange way, looking like he was trying not limp. \"Why is he....\" Sarah began, but I could not hear the rest of the sentence because she had to go to her room. Anyhow, I knew she was talking about the way dad was walking. The next day, we woke early to discuss who could have taken it. \"It was such an ugly necklace. I cannot imagine who would have wanted to take it.\" Sarah said. \"It would seem ugly to us kids. Perhaps adults think it is beautiful. adults tastes are so odd, as you know. Or perhaps it was so valuable that no-one cared how ugly it would look.\" \"Well, neither you nor I nor any other youngster would have wanted it. It`s not like us to run after money.\" \"It certainly was a grown-up who stole it.\" I agreed. \"That means that neither Micheal, nor Gary, Chris or Isabella could have done it.\" \"Now we have to list the adults in this house. There`s mother, father, Uncle Henry, Aunt Mary, and Uncle John. Apart from them there is the maid.\" \"That brings us nowhere. We have no evidence against or for anyone.\" \"The maid is not allowed inside the room.\" \"Yes, she`s innocent. See, mom and dad are having breakfast right now, so we can sneak in and look about in their room for clues.\" The two of us went downstairs. Uncle John passed us in the hallway. I felt sorry to think that he was among our suspects, as I was especially fond of him and he was like me. \"Ouch! please don`t step on my foot, uncle! You do have such awfully large feet!\" I yelped. We went on to the living room. In the living room, we saw Aunt Mary and Uncle Henry looking at one of the small mysterious holes in the wall that had been there since the building had been constructed. It was a curious hole, around four feet from the ground. Uncle Henry had his finger in it. \"Just-can`t-reach-it!\" He sighed. \"I guess I`ll have to make do without a pen until I buy another.\" \"I suppose I could try?\" Aunt Mary put her finger on the hole, but it was so thick that she could not put it in. She shook her head. The short, fat man who was Uncle Henry shrugged. \"It`s too deep inside anyway.\" We reached the room. \"There it is-the safe. It is on top of the cupboard, five and a half feet high. I remember dad saying it`s key is in an awfully secret place, and he wouldn`t tell anyone where except mother. He also said that the lock cannot be picked except by a very expert finger.\" I said, looking at the safe. It was black in colour, and had a strangely large keyhole on its right. It was rectangular, with the width just slightly longer than the height. I looked around the room. It was almost a perfect cube. Driven by sheer instinct, I knelt down and looked under the bed. There was a strange print on the carpet, which was particularly soft over there. Just then Sarah, who was looking around the cupboard, exclaimed: \"Look! There`s a footprint on the carpet! It`s just by the cupboard, see there? But mom and dad always take off their shoes before going in. It's so small. That`s strange, isn`t it?\" \"It's a clue, all right. There... wait a minute....\" Suddenly I had a flash of inspiration. \"I know who did it! I know, I know! In the room, now! I`ll tell you there!\" Who stole the necklace?\n  choice: Dad\n  choice: Uncle John\n  choice: Mom\n  choice: Aunt Mary\n  choice: Uncle Henry\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: “It snows and everyone becomes a kid again,” Jack grumbled. While his co-workers were leaving early or acting juvenile, he was trying to piece together his interview notes. He had spoken with the governor’s son, Elliot, about a recent academic scandal in which he was accused of cheating on his exams and helping other students to cheat as well. It would end up being a top story for The Printed Voice and he wasn’t leaving work until he had finished a draft. Amy, a childish co-worker, peeked her head in the doorway. “Jack, come out and play!” She hopped in to face him, peering over the large stack of notes that filled his work area. He grabbed two handfuls of paper and held them up. “I’m trying to work. I’ve seen snow before.” “You’ve seen snow, eh? Well, do you see my hand behind my back?” she giggled. Something cold and wet smacked Jack in the face. Recovering from the partially melted snowball, he watched Amy scamper away. As he ran out of his office, he grabbed the door handle and pulled it shut, rattling it with his palm twice to make sure it had locked. Dashing through the lobby in hot pursuit, Jack nearly collided with another reporter, Lucy, while she was coming inside the building. “Excuse you!” Lucy yelled back at him. Lucy was a bitter reporter and the office gossip. Most people tried to steer clear of her. Jack, unfortunately, had bumped right into her. Jack called back a quick apology as he continued the chase. Running outside, he stepped on a patch of ice. He found himself on the ground, looking up at the winter sky. He sat back up and saw Mr. Jenkins, the custodian of the facility, standing on the sidewalk with his trash receptacle. “Glad to see you’re finally having some fun,” he called out to Jack with a grin. “This was not my idea of a break,” Jack groaned back. Mr. Jenkins shook his head again. “Well, I mopped up the mess in front of your office just a moment ago. I feel like I have been attacking wet footprints ever since it started snowing.” Jack gave him a frown of sympathy. “Sorry. That was from Amy, not me.” Mr. Jenkins sighed and gave a shrug before heading inside. Another co-worker, Sarah, stepped out right after him and burst out laughing when she saw Jack still sitting on the ground. “This is a change of scenery for you,” Sarah giggled as she stopped in front of him. “I bet you wish you’d landed Alex’s Sea World story … you’d be enjoying the sunny San Diego weather right about now!” Still dazed, Jack wasn’t exactly paying attention. Sarah adjusted her heavy shoulder bag, and waved her hand in front of his eyes, “Hello? Is anyone in there?” “Sorry,” he said, “I’m just stressed – as usual.” “I know how that is,” she replied. “… If only my name were Lucy, then, I’d be dating the boss’s son. And, then, I’d get to do whatever I wanted.” It looked like Sarah was leaving the office for a month rather than heading home early. She, like Jack, was a self-proclaimed workaholic. “The snow is coming down pretty heavy,” she added, “I have a feeling that if you want to head out, it will be OK.” “Well, I guess I better get back to work so I can go.” Jack stood up and wiped the remaining snow off of his clothes. As he was heading back into the office, a snowball hit him in the back of his head. He whirled around to find Amy sticking her tongue out at him. “Are you going to let her get away with that?” Sarah smiled as she began walking down the sidewalk toward the parking lot; she was leaving for the day. Jack retaliated with two snowball attacks of his own, and after fifteen minutes had passed, he decided it was time to retreat back into the warm building. Amy remained outside, choosing to freeze her toes for a while longer. Jack found himself stepping over miniature puddles of melted snow in front of his office. Mr. Jenkins had already cleaned up the mess left over from Amy’s snowball. Evidently everyone in the building was tracking in messy footprints without worrying about giving the custodian extra work. Jack rolled his eyes and unlocked his door. He stopped in his tracks. His desk was completely clean. Not a single paper remained. Walking inside, he stepped on something. Jack looked down and picked up a bent company ID card. The printed name on the card read: Alex Rebmevon. Alex, the official owner of the ID, was a fellow reporter at The Printed Voice. He was also the boss’s son. Back during his college days, Jack had once locked himself outside of his dorm room and used his student ID to pick the lock. Jack questioned if the door in his office was just as easy to get into. As Jack stood in the middle of the room, puzzled and angry by the intrusion, he heard a long whistle from behind. He turned to find Amy once again standing in the doorway. She nodded her head toward the immaculate desk. “Looks like you decided to get rid of that busy work, after all.” “I didn’t do this,” Jack held up the ID, “he did.” Amy snatched the card from his hand and studied it. “Well, it looks like this is what the culprit used alright. This card is wrecked.” “ … Only one way to find out,” Jack said, as he whipped out his cell phone and dialed Alex’s number. There was no answer. Amy was still standing in front of him. “Do you know who did it?” she asked. He thought back to Sarah and the massive shoulder bag she had been carrying. “Maybe,” he answered. But his eyes narrowed as he weighed in the evidence and ran through a growing list of suspects. Mr. Jenkins had a key to every office in the building. And he had walked back inside shortly before Jack, explaining the puddles at the door. They searched the building for the custodian and found him in the reception area, collecting trash. Jack explained the situation to him and asked about the missing papers. “You really think I would do that?” Mr. Jenkins said, hurt by the accusation. He continued, “Though, I’ll admit, I did use Alex’s ID card to break into the office. Jack replied quickly, “No, I don’t think you’re a suspect at all. You’ve been too busy cleaning all day. But, now that you mention it … why did you use the ID to break into my office?” “Well, I swear I didn’t touch anything on your desk, it was already clean as a whistle when I went in to collect your trash. I used my key to get in the first time, but I accidentally left my keys on your filing cabinet and had shut the locked door before I realized it. I found the ID on the floor earlier and it was already bent up. I figured it couldn’t be used anymore, so what was the harm in using it to get back in?” “So someone used the ID to break into my office before you found it then?” He thought about some of the things that had been taken and remembered his notes from the interview. Even the notes themselves would be something any other reporter at The Printed Voice would love to get his hands on. And one of them had. All of his co-workers were likely suspects. Who took the papers?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: “Say what you will about the Straw Hat circuit,” Arthur Glendon observed, “it does get us out of New York for the hot summer.” He waved a hand around, taking in the Straw Hat Theater, with its inviting lodge and Summer Theater, a hillside picture book Vermont setting. Janice Starling smiled. “Oh, I don’t know, Summer Theater is rather fun, and all that, I’ll agree, but we’re all hoping for something new, something to take us back to Broadway.” “As if you had ever been there, except for buying a ticket as a member of the audience for one of my plays,” Alice Cartwright said. “But Janice does have a point. New York is where the best opportunities are in the theater. Frankly, when I’m not in the city” - she said the word as though only one city existed in the world - “I just can’t wait to get back. Anyway, Arthur, what play are you casting for? I assume from your message on my cell phone, and the presence of these ladies that you have something specific in mind.” “No need to get over dramatic, dear,” interjected Sandra Buckingham, seated on the most comfortable chair in the room, which she had chosen as her entitlement. “It won’t help you get the part, whatever Arthur has in mind.” “Thank heavens I only asked the three of you!” Arthur thought. What he actually said was quite different. “We’re doing a new play, a comedy, “All’s Right, Now That You’re Here”. There is a wonderful female romantic lead, Rosemary. She’s full of fun and deviltry.” He paused for effect. “Surely one of you at least will fit the part perfectly. I have the scripts for you here. Take them back to the lodge. I’ll hear tryouts tomorrow morning at ten. Then we’ll really get down to business, with excerpts from the play. You - I mean for rehearsal, and then the lead actually selected - will be reading opposite Rex Lansford. I’ll be picking him up later tonight at the airport.” That was Arthur Glendon’s moment, and he had played it to the hilt. The three women gasped. Nobody had expected to find, in this rural corner of Vermont, that Rex Lansford would be playing in Summer Theater. Lansford, they all knew, had just last week celebrated the opening of his latest film, a summer blockbuster that was earning more than Steven Spielberg’s latest. Each woman knew that playing opposite Hollywood’s most bankable leading man could launch a career, or jump-start a stalled one. Janice Starling, Sandra Buckingham and Alice Cartwright each swore that she would get that part - nothing would stand in the way of that happening. They took their scripts and melted away to the lodge. The actresses came to the realization at just about the same time. The play’s story was about an actress who got her big break by making sure that the competition for the part was unable to try out. It all seemed rather amateurish, a laxative substituted for a chocolate bar, a misleading phone message that the tryout was rescheduled, that sort of thing. It was an updated, “All About Eve” with an edge. But it was also a broad comedy, played strictly for laughs, and the part absolutely sparkled. Played opposite Rex Lansford, who knew where it might lead? And just what did Arthur Glendon have in mind, anyway? Didn’t he know how nervous he was making them? Was life supposed to imitate art, or the other way around? Three guards went up, and the three actresses each made plans to secure the part. The more they read the play, the more the part sparkled, and the more they suspected each other. They each came to dinner and sat at separate tables, glowering across the dining room. Nobody was going to slip a laxative past them! The evening was devoted to rehearsal preparation, each in her own room. It went on and on. In the wee hours of the morning, Sandra Buckingham talked so loudly that Alice Cartwright, who had the room just beneath Sandra’s, pounded on the ceiling with a stick to quiet her rival. The noise stopped. “Well, she’s really there after all,” Alice thought. “We’ll see about her in the morning!” Janice Starling, who had the room next to Alice Cartwright, yawned in exhaustion. She decided not to go to breakfast in the morning. She asked the front desk for a wake up call, then took a sleeping pill and went back to bed. Promptly at ten o’clock the following morning, Alice and Sandra were on the set, ready for the casting call. Arthur was first on the set as usual. He frowned, but refused the suggestion that someone be sent to remind the missing Janice Starling that she was overdue for the tryout. “Pass me some of that hot lemonade, will you dearie?” Sandra said to Alice. Alice poured a mug of hot lemonade from the rolling snack bar just off the set. It was Sandra’s habit during rehearsals - so ingrained that directors made fun of the “hot lemonade” clause in her contracts. She wanted to clear her throat before going on stage. Sandra got just half way through her prepared monologue when she gasped and grabbed her throat. “What’s going on!” she managed to say, in between coughs ... “Somebody sabotaged this drink. It’s got vinegar in it!” She glared at Alice and tried wildly to find something to clear her vocal cords. Finally, she sat down and stared at Glendon. “Give me some time to get over this,” she said. “Of course, dear,” Glendon replied, in his very best butter-wouldn’t-melt tone of voice. He made a call with his cell phone, and then motioned to Alice Cartwright to begin her presentation. She started her monologue, but at that moment, Rex Lansford came onto the set. Glendon waved at Alice to continue, but with Lansford as a surprised witness, he and Sandra spent the next twenty minutes telling each other loud, boisterous stories. From onstage, Alice Cartwright looked at them first pleadingly, then in an imperious way, every inch Mary Queen of Scots faced with her persecutors. Then Janice Starling entered the set, out of breath, dress barely arranged, embarrassed, and full of apologies. “I left a wakeup call, but they never called me until just a few minutes ago,” she said. The excuse sounded lame, and her voice began to lose confidence. Arthur Glendon made a great show of looking at his watch. Janice glared at him and broke into her monologue. It was brilliantly performed. She smiled and left the stage. “Not so fast,” Alice said. “If you two are now ready to listen, I’m ready to perform.” Her monologue was flawless. Sandra had cleared her throat at last. She had spent the evening memorizing Rosemary’s key speech at the end of Act Two. It was so well done, that even her competitors applauded. Then Rex Lansford spoke to the three women. “You are all fine actresses, and Rosemary is a special part, somewhat devilish, I think Arthur told you. Just think what she would have done to get her part.” Then a light seemed to dawn, and the veteran star added, “I know what happened, and who is responsible for this very odd and untraditional tryout.” Who sabotaged the tryouts?\nAnswer:",

        "inputs": "Story: \"I can so!\" \"You can not! No one can train a cat to fetch.\" Muggles the cat was smart — and talented. But no one knew it, and his owner, fifteen-year-old Andy, couldn't make anyone believe it. This led to a strange crime, which involved a cat, a teenager, and an unsolved mystery. That month, four cats in his neighborhood had already disappeared. The owners had searched, but their cats were never found. Meanwhile, in a big old house across town, a strange woman lived with over forty cats. The town was also surprisingly famous for its cats. All across the country, TV shows included a pet food commercial, showcasing cats doing amazing tricks. Joshua Sellers was a film producer who had discovered cats that could magically leap through hoops, or do dances on their hind legs. Every commercial featured a new and talented cat, and Sellers always boasted that he'd found every cat himself. But because of the neighborhood's cat-stealing, Andy's parents had wanted to buy him a dog for a pet instead. Andy told them that cats were cooler; though Andy's friend, Rick, insisted his dog was better — only because it could fetch a rubber ball. One afternoon, a crowd of five students had gathered around the two. They all stood behind Rick. “Your cat can't even climb the fence around your back yard,” Rick taunted. Angry and offended, Andy invited them all to his house after school — to settle the pet debate once and for all. Throughout the school, students gossiped about Andy’s cat; and by the end of the day, a crowd of thirty students was en route to his house. Andy's mother was surprised, and a bit alarmed when she saw the troops arriving. \"Can I get you anything, Andy? she asked. \"Yeah. A piece of foil.\" Andy went into the backyard alone, and closed the sliding glass door behind him. \"I don't care what my friends think,\" he told the cat honestly. \"But can we give it a try?\" And then he reached into his pocket and pulled out the crumpled foil. Muggles stared as Andy twiddled it between his fingers. What was that shiny thing? \"There it goes!\" Andy shouted, tossing the foil to the ground. Muggles leapt after the ball of foil — and the thirty students inside his house cheered. When Muggles had the ball in his mouth, Andy called out to him with a poignant emotion in his voice than trumped his youthful conscience. Muggles had his ears perked up, but he didn't want to let go of the foil. He ran to where Andy stood firm, still holding the foil in his mouth. And the students in his house cheered again. Rick was peeved, but everybody ignored him, chanting: \"Andy was right. Right was Andy!” Victory eluded Andy that night when his winning partner, Muggles, disappeared. \"Do you think he wandered off into the night?\" Andy's mother asked. Muggles had never done that before, Andy insisted. But who would steal someone's cat? The only person who'd come by last night was the newspaper delivery boy, and that was around 6 p.m. Everyone in the neighborhood received a free copy of the evening newspaper. \"I'm sorry about your cat,\" said Rick, after Andy told him the news the next day at school. Rick had some bad news of his own. His mother had called the teacher, telling her that Rick's grandmother had been sick. She warned the teacher that Rick might be sleepy, because the whole family had spent the night in the hospital's waiting room. It was like everyone in town was having an unlucky night. Andy worried all day, and then decided there was only one thing to do. After school, Andy didn't go home. Instead he rode his bicycle to the untraveled edge of the neighborhood. Empty fields surrounded him, and the silenced consumed him. There were no kids playing ball, or parents calling out to their kids. There was just one thing: the massive house of the woman who was said to have forty cats. Could it really be true? And then he heard rustling at his feet. A cat was rubbing his leg. And behind it were five more cats. More cats peered from under the house, and more peeked around its corner. Suddenly, there were dozens and dozens of cats, all scampering towards Andy: white cats, grey cats, tabbies, and more! The yard filled with cats, all approaching and meowing. And the meowing cats could surely be heard inside the house. Suddenly, the door swung open like an oven. \"What are you doing to my cats?\" a voice shouted. Andy looked up to see a big woman with short black hair, and a very disturbed face. First he was scared, and then startled, as he whispered his response: “My name's Andy.” The woman looked, confused, as Andy continued, “I lost my cat.” “And you thought I stole him?” the woman said, defensively. “I came to check,” Andy said, honestly. \"Come inside,\" she said. Andy wasn't sure that he should. “My name's Edith,” her voice softened, “and I don’t scratch.” Andy smiled uncomfortably. “I love cats,” she said, melodically. “People always think I have stolen theirs. But, I just have a lot of cats.” Just then, he heard a car pulling up in the street behind him. Andy turned to see a man getting out, wearing an expensive suit. He had neatly-trimmed hair, dark sunglasses that didn’t rest quite right on his nose, and he was listening to the voicemail on his cellphone. Edith smiled, and introduced Andy: “Now here's a man who really likes cats.” The man stared at the ocean of cats surrounding Andy, scanning each one as though appraising them for an auction. Edith said proudly, “Meet a local celebrity, the man behind all those cat food commercials. Meet Joshua Sellers.” Joshua nodded with pride, still eying the cats in her yard. “I found some of my most-talented cats in this very yard. And now they're national TV stars!” Andy looked around. Beneath the cats, he could see the “lawn,” which Andy mentally redefined as “clumps of grass,” surrounded by wide patches of dirt. It seemed strange that nationally-acclaimed-cats could come from such a poorly-painted house. Andy saw a cage at the side of the yard. No cat would be happy in a cage for very long, but he knew that a cage was sometimes necessary; he used a kennel to transport Muggles to his doctor appointments. The cage was on top of yesterday’s free copy of the newspaper. Edith must have been reading Andy’s mind, he though. “I don't read the newspaper,” she sighed. “And I haven't used that cage for months, either. My precious cats hate being cooped up!” Mr. Sellers seemed a little disappointed that they weren't paying more attention to his career. “I just discovered an amazing cat,” he said excitedly. “I just flew to New York to appear on the David Letterman show, and I took the cat with me to impress him!” Andy couldn't help but wonder if the cat's trick was chasing foil. Mr. Sellers returned to his cellphone. “I've got 13 unheard voicemail messages,” he exclaimed. “Lucky 13!” He'd been so busy flying to New York yesterday morning, he'd forgotten to check his voicemail — until an hour ago, when he got back to the city. “I've got a story you can tell David Letterman,” said Andy. “Tell him I've figured out who's stealing the neighborhood's cats!” Who is responsible for stealing the cats?\nAnswer:",
