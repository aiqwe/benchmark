Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. \nStory: The biologists found out that the Indian Ocean had a lower water pH than it did a decade ago, and it became acidic. The water in the Arctic ocean still had a neutral to basic pH. \nQuestion: Which ocean had more instances of marine organisms reproducing less?\nA:",

Playing Ohio state rivals Cleveland Browns, the defense looked the exact opposite as they did in week one. Browns quarterback Derek Anderson started and threw for 328 yards and five touchdowns. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game. Jamal Lewis had 215 yards rushing with one touchdown and the Browns had two receivers with over 100 yards, Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow. The Bengals offense tried their best to keep the team in the game, however, as Carson Palmer threw for 6 TD's and Chad Johnson caught for 209 yards. The game started out slowly in the first quarter but the second quarter saw a combined 35 points scored. It was close in the end, when the Bengals started a drive with under one minute left. They managed to get the ball to the 50-yard line when Carson Palmer was intercepted by Leigh Bodden on an intended pass for Chad Johnson. This game ended up being the eighth highest scoring game in NFL history, but not the highest scoring game between these two teams. In 2004, the Bengals beat the Browns 58-48 for the second-most combined points. The Redskins (72) and Giants (41) combined for 113 points in 1966 for the most.

You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. 4. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. 5. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. 6. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY. Prompt: Create a pair of fill in the blanks questions based on the context word.\nQ: Context Word: howling.\nA:",

Try to use a variety of reasoning types in your questions (some of sample reasoning types are illustrated in the 'postive examples' field) and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates). \nA span is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. In such questions, the answer spans are recommended to be five words. \nQuestions with answer type \"number\", are expected to start with \"How many\". For instance, \"How long did an event last?\" can be phrased as \"How many years did an event last?\". \n Things to Avoid: - Emphasis/Caution: In order to incrase diversity, try to create more questions for which the answer will be multiple spans.

In the first quarter, Baltimore trailed early as Giants RB Brandon Jacobs got back-to-back 1-yard TD runs (with a failed PAT on the latter).  In the second quarter, the Ravens continued to struggle as quarterback Eli Manning completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Darcy Johnson.  Baltimore closed out the half with kicker Matt Stover getting a 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Ravens tried to rally as rookie quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 10-yard TD pass to FB Le'Ron McClain.  However, New York answered with CB Aaron Ross returning an interception 50 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants closed out the game as kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 19-yard field goal.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran.Sent 2: And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media.Sent 3: But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued.Sent 4: On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \"waging war against God\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record.Sent 5: There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year.Sent 6: Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women.Sent 7: Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism.Sent 8: And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani.Sent 9: Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists.Sent 10: The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership.Sent 11: Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people.Sent 12: See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade.Sent 13: One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \"solidarity\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress.Sent 14: While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. \nQuestion: Who received a prison sentence on the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York? (A) Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (B) Nazar Ahari (C) Shiva Nazar Ahari, a young female defender of human rights, received a sentence of six years in prison.\nA:",

In the first quarter, the Bengals drew first blood as quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chad Johnson. The Saints would reply when quarterback Drew Brees completed a 72-yard touchdown strike to wide receiver Joe Horn. Midway through the second quarter, Cincinnati took the lead, when kicker Shayne Graham booted a 21-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, New Orleans still trailed by three points. In the fourth quarter, Saints kicker John Carney tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. The Bengals offense awoke, and Palmer and Johnson connected with each other two times on 60-yard and 4-yard touchdown passes. The Bengal defense scored too, when rookie defensive back Ethan Kilmer returned a Brees interception 52 yards for a touchdown.  The Saints offense could only manage one more score , when Brees completed a 27-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrance Copper. The Bengal defense then blocked the extra point attempt. Even though the Bengals were out-gained 595 yards to 385 yards, the Bengals snapped their three-game skid, and their record improved to 5-5. \nQuestion: How many touchdowns were scored in the first half?\nA:",
