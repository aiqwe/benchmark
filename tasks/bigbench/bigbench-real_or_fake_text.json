The panel is expected to issue a ruling by April 15. The decision by the pilots gives negotiators on both sides more than a week to narrow their differences and avoid a work stoppage that many believe would lead to a liquidation of Delta. Among the issues is the company's request for $305 million in annual pay cuts; the pilots have offered $140 million. '' The Delta pilots will strike if their contract is rejected,'' said Lee Moak, a pilot and chairman of the Delta chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association. Delta filed for bankruptcy protection in September, and after the filing both sides agreed to arbitration rather than have a bankruptcy judge rule on management's motion to void the pilots' contract and impose lower wages and other conditions. Under the agreement between the pilots and the airline, which covers 1.4 million workers, they would receive new, higher salaries next year, while some work years would be shortened. But the $315-a-month salary offered by the union - an amount rejected by the company - was not enough to satisfy pilots, who voted by 61 percent to 39 percent to authorize a strike as early as Monday if their demands were not met. A similar vote would also give the National Mediation Board the authority to compel the airline to negotiate under binding arbitration, as the pilots' unions demanded in negotiations. The new deal could face strong opposition from politicians in Congress.\n  choice: The panel is expected to issue a ruling by April 15.\n  choice: Among the issues is the company's request for $305 million in annual pay cuts; the pilots have offered $140 million.

It would clean the water as it flowed in and out from the source; it provided an artificial pool for our little group of children to swim; it provided protection against predators like raccoons and coyotes, which were common at this time of year; and when I became quite a young adult, it allowed me and my family to bathe comfortably without fear of running into the street to reach the bathroom door. However, over time, my parents began to notice some negative effects from using the water that surrounded us: The rocks around the stream started to be coated with brown, sticky substances. We had to regularly rinse our hands thoroughly before eating, or we'd accidentally ingest enough wet sand to turn black and lose any and all color from our skin. My younger brother developed acute gastroenteritis, and soon thereafter, his mother noticed he couldn't stop vomiting after eating. And on a more frequent basis, we found ourselves rushing down the street, terrified of stepping into the water because of the silt. Eventually, I and my friends learned that what these people saw as \"fun\" had become a dangerous practice – one that could potentially harm everyone who went swimming in their yards. So how did a game like this get turned into something so harmful? Well, this type of activity is called river-dwelling and began gaining popularity through folkloric practices back in the 1700s. At first, it consisted of individuals fishing for fish from ponds that ran alongside rivers, but then in the 1800s, authorities began to regulate this practice by prohibiting those who lived within 1 mile of a river from entering them to take part in such activities.\n  choice: We had to regularly rinse our hands thoroughly before eating, or we'd accidentally ingest enough wet sand to turn black and lose any and all color from our skin.\n  choice: At first, it consisted of individuals fishing for fish from ponds that ran alongside rivers, but then in the 1800s, authorities began to regulate this practice by prohibiting those who lived within 1 mile of a river from entering them to take part in such activities.\n  choice: It would clean the water as it flowed in and out from the source; it provided an artificial pool for our little group of children to swim; it provided protection against predators like raccoons and coyotes, which were common at this time of year; and when I became quite a young adult, it allowed me and my family to bathe comfortably without fear of running into the street to reach the bathroom door.\n  choice: And on a more frequent basis, we found ourselves rushing down the street, terrified of stepping into the water because of the silt.\n  choice: So how did a game like this get turned into something so harmful?\n  choice: Eventually, I and my friends learned that what these people saw as \"fun\" had become a dangerous practice – one that could potentially harm everyone who went swimming in their yards.\n  choice: Well, this type of activity is called river-dwelling and began gaining popularity through folkloric practices back in the 1700s.\n  choice: In the backyard of my childhood, there was a stream that served many purposes.\n  choice: However, over time, my parents began to notice some negative effects from using the water that surrounded us: The rocks around the stream started to be coated with brown, sticky substances.\n  choice: My younger brother developed acute gastroenteritis, and soon thereafter, his mother noticed he couldn't stop vomiting after eating.\nFIRST COMPUTER-GENERATED SENTENCE:",
