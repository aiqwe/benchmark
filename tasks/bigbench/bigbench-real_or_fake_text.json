It was time for me to go home and get some sleep. I had been working in this field for over 20 years now, and I have seen many species of alligators change their behavior as they age. Some will become more aggressive while others will become less so. The most common thing that happens is that the older an alligator gets, the more likely it is to be found dead or injured. This can happen anywhere from a few days after being released into the wild to several months later. The reason why this occurs is because alligators are very territorial creatures. They do not like other animals getting too close to them. If you were to try to approach one without first making sure that there was no danger present, then chances are good that you would end up getting bitten. This is especially true if you are trying to feed your alligator.\n  choice: This can happen anywhere from a few days after being released into the wild to several months later.\n  choice: I had been working in this field for over 20 years now, and I have seen many species of alligators change their behavior as they age.\n  choice: The most common thing that happens is that the older an alligator gets, the more likely it is to be found dead or injured.\n  choice: As I finished up my research on Alligator breeding habits for a story I was tasked with writing, a bell began to ring loudly throughout the office.\n  choice: They do not like other animals getting too close to them.\n  choice: If you were to try to approach one without first making sure that there was no danger present, then chances are good that you would end up getting bitten.\n  choice: This is especially true if you are trying to feed your alligator.\n  choice: Some will become more aggressive while others will become less so.\n  choice: It was time for me to go home and get some sleep.\n  choice: The reason why this occurs is because alligators are very territorial creatures.\nFIRST COMPUTER-GENERATED SENTENCE:",
