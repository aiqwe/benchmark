If you put \"curious\" first, before other adjectives, the implication is that the cat is strange. Put it last, though, and you imply that the cat exhibits curiosity.\n  choice: neutral\n  choice: supportive\n  choice: unsupportive\nA:",

It was bad after Katrina BUT, the stories of looting and violence where greatly exaggerated (mostly by the media). I knew people who came to my town afterwards, the stories made me more afraid of what my government and police would do in an apocalypse instead of the general populace.   >And anyway, I already grow hops at home. If I can get some grains growing, I can make my own beer, too.  Now that is forward thinking! LOL  >Thats because Ive no plans!  Thats what most people tend to say and I cant blame them. Ive lived through a Category 4/5 Hurricane that pretty much destroyed my town and left us without power for a month. The water wasnt safe unless it was boiled (and made you sick if you drank it). There were food lines, National Guard roaming the streets, etc etc. It sucked in general. Whats worse is that there was already no food because everyone ran for the grocery stores before the storm hit. There was so much debris stores couldnt get stocked for several days.  My grandmother was smart though, and had a ton of food in our freezer and pantry. Even though we had plenty she was like Go in the food lines and get more, you cant be too prepared. Ill never forget that.  Thats why I keep a stock of food and supplies ready. Its not like Ive got a HUGE stockpile but I could probably live off of it for a a few months. If I had the money Id buy 4-5 of those containers that have like 120 meals in them. Most survival food has a shelf life of 10+ years anyway, so it pretty much can sit in the corner until its needed.  >Never expected to get dragged into a serious discussion in a thread about what kind of vehicle I wanted if the apocalypse happened...
