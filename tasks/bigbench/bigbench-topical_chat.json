Not surprising, Alabama seems to do Alabama things, and keep the ban on interracial marriages, even though its uneforceable.\" agent_B: \"Yes, it's also surprising to discover that 34% of black men don't have the right to vote in Alabama. That seems odd. \" agent_A: \"Is that due to felons not having the right to vote? \" agent_B: \"I'm not sure of the reason. It would seem unlikely that 34% of black men in Alabama are felons, though. In the UK, all men didn't have the right to vote until 1918. \" agent_A: \"I never knew Steven Colber went to congress to defend agriculture visas for immigrants.\" agent_B: \"I had no idea he did that, either.

He is very involved in stopping sex trafficking. \" agent_B: \"That's interesting. I wonder how he became involved in that cause. I figured he would be more involved in causes surrounding pediatric heart disease. \" agent_A: \"I'm not sure, I think it was a random thing that he found when he was on the night shift when his daughter was a baby.\" agent_B:",
