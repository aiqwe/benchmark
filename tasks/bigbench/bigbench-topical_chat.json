They used to wash clothes on Old Faithful too, like an explosive washing machine. \" agent_A: \"I'll bet they ended up losing a lot of clothes. Also, who knew Pilgrims wore colorful clothing? They only wore black for special occasions, I just found out.\" agent_B: \"I didn't know about that, I only ever see pilgrim pictures in Thanksgiving so I guess that makes sense. Did you know that t-shirts were invented in 1904 for bachelors who didn't know how to sew. \" agent_A: \"I just see the image of Pilgrims dressed in black and white, with those big ole buckles on the hats and shoes.\" agent_B: \"Same here, usually they're eating some turkey with some Native American tribe.\" agent_A: \"And learning from said Native Americans how not to starve come winter, but I digress.....\" agent_B: \"The Native Americans didn't start dressing like the pilgrims though, unlike an African tribe that still wears Victorian clothes in the style of German colonizers. \" agent_A: \"Man, those colonizers were bad news...... That was a cool fact about the origin of the t-shirt, BTW\" agent_B: \"Yeah they were bad news, but at least the tribe kind of made it their own style. \" agent_A: \"I would trade land rights, and liberty over style any day, but I see your point.\" agent_B:",

Another scientist who has two careers would be Harrison schmitt. He is the only scientist to walk on the moon!\" agent_A: \"That is pretty cool. Good for him.

I found that really fascinating.\" agent_A: \"Wow that is pretty advanced and sound intriguing. Do you know how www was invented?\" agent_B: \"I believe that it was invented by an english scientist in 1989. That scientist was working in Switzerland. Do you know anymore details on how it was invented? I am really curious to know.\" agent_A: \"Just a bit like, he was working for CERN which is a European state-funded organization that does research\" agent_B: \"Really? That is pretty cool. I found it very interesting that a store in Alabama only sells items found in unclaimed baggage at the airport.\" agent_A: \"THat is something, I would like to check that out at some point.

DO you know when pilgrims wear black clothes?\" agent_B: \"No I did not know that! Furthermore, Rip curl is a company that manufactures in North Korea but labels it as made in China. \" agent_A: \"Hahah go figure. DO you know how fashion aficionados can tell if you need your clothes tailored?\" agent_B: \"Interesting. Speaking of fashion, did you know that British politicians had to wear a top if when they made a point on the House of Commons? This was mandatory up until 1998!\" agent_A: \"That is strange to me but I guess it worked for them. Do you know how the tipping of the hat originated/.\" agent_B:",
