A hawk heard her call and asked what he would get in return for taking her with him. The tortoise, eager to take to the skies, promised him all the riches of the Red Sea. The hawk agreed and carried the tortoise upwards in his talons. But, just as they reached the clouds, he suddenly let go of her and the tortoise fell towards the ground, eventually landing on the side of a mountain and shattering her shell.
