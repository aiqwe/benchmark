Therefore, he said to the lamb: \"I remember that you insulted me most gravely last year!\". The lamb replied that she was not even born back then. The coyote thus came up with another lie: \"Clearly, you are grazing on my pasture!\" The lamb, however, retorted that she has never even tasted grass, due to her young age. Exasperated, the coyote said: \"Well, then you’re drinking from my well!\" In response, the lamb pointed out that she only drank her mother’s milk. Fed up, the coyote picked up the lamb and swallowed her, saying: \"Well, despite your convincing arguments, I choose not to remain without dinner.\" What is the moral of this story?\n  choice: Every one is more or less master of his own fate.\n  choice: We often give our enemies the means for our own destruction.\n  choice: Liberty is too huge a price to pay for revenge.\n  choice: Any excuse will serve a tyrant.\n  choice: Vanity carries its own punishment.\nA:",

One day, she heard the sound of dogs approaching from a distance which scared her greatly, as it was rabbit hunting season. Thus, she decided to escape them with the help of her many friends. First, she asked the horse to carry her to safety. The horse, however, refused his help, since he had work to do and felt sure that the rabbit would be helped by her other friends. Next, she asked the oxen to drive away the dogs away with his mighty horns, but he, too, refused to help, saying that he had already made plans with a lady friend of his. \"The ram will certainly help you\", he said, before turning away from the rabbit. The ram refused to help, as well, since the same dogs were known to attack sheep as well as rabbits. Almost out of time and options, the rabbit finally asked the calf for his help, but the young animal was uncomfortable with accepting such responsibility, seeing as so many adults declined to take on the task. Soon enough, the dogs arrived in the forest, but by then the rabbit had run away without anyone’s assistance.

Next day, the goats were unable to go to the pasture due to a heavy storm, so the goatherd supplied them with hay for the day, giving the wild goats plenty of food to entice them to stay, while only giving just enough to the rest of the flock. The day after, just as the goatherd opened the enclosure to bring the goats to the pasture, the wild goats stormed out and ran away as fast as they could. Upset, the goatherd shouted after them, accusing them of ingratitude. The goats replied: \"The very reason why we do not want to stay is that you gave us more food than your own flock! If we stayed and some new goats came along, you would treat us badly just to impress the new arrivals.\" What is the moral of this story?\n  choice: Persuasion is better than force.\n  choice: We should bear our troubles bravely rather than try to escape them.\n  choice: Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of their neighbors.\n  choice: Old friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new ones.\n  choice: Trouble comes from the direction we least expect it.\nA:",
