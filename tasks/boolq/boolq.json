        "question": "is the tv show supernatural based on a book",
        "answer": false,
        "passage": "Before bringing Supernatural to television, creator Eric Kripke had been developing the series for nearly ten years, having been fascinated with urban legends since he was a child. He had originally envisioned Supernatural as a movie. He later developed it as a TV series and spent a few years pitching it before it was picked up by The WB. The concept went through several phases before becoming the eventual product, shifting from the original idea of an anthology series to one of tabloid reporters driving around the country in a van ``fighting the demons in search of the truth''. Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it was the ``best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these stories.''"

        "question": "does bourbon have to be made in kentucky",
        "answer": false,
        "passage": "Bourbon whiskey /bɜːrbən/ is a type of American whiskey, a barrel-aged distilled spirit made primarily from corn. The name is derived from the French Bourbon dynasty, although it is unclear precisely what inspired the whiskey's name (contenders include Bourbon County in Kentucky and Bourbon Street in New Orleans). Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century. The use of the term ``bourbon'' for the whiskey has been traced to the 1820s, and the term began to be used consistently in Kentucky in the 1870s. While bourbon may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South, and with Kentucky in particular. As of 2014, the distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. is about $2.7 billion, and bourbon makes up about two-thirds of the $1.6 billion of U.S. exports of distilled spirits."

        "question": "can you dribble a basketball with two hands",
        "answer": false,
        "passage": "In basketball, an illegal dribble (colloquially called a double dribble), occurs when a player ends his/her dribble by catching or causing the ball to come to rest in one or both hands and then dribbles it again with one hand or when a player touches it twice before the ball hits the ground. The dribble also ends when the dribbler palms/carries the ball by allowing it to come to rest in one or both hands. This is a palming/carrying the ball violation if the player continues with another dribble."

        "passage": "The Doctorate of Medicine and of Philosophy (MD--PhD) is a dual doctoral degree for physician--scientists, combining the vocational training of the Doctor of Medicine degree with the research expertise of the Doctor of Philosophy degree. The degree is granted by medical schools often through the Medical Scientist Training Program or other non-MSTP MD--PhD programs. The National Institutes of Health currently provides 43 medical schools with Medical Scientist Training Program grants that support the training of students in MD--PhD programs at these institutions through tuition and stipend allowances. These programs are often competitive, with some admitting as few as two students per academic year. The MCAT score and GPA of MD--PhD matriculants are often higher than MD only matriculants."

        "question": "was the book of enoch in the septuagint",
        "answer": false,
        "passage": "Although evidently widely known during the development of the Hebrew Bible canon, 1 Enoch was excluded from both the formal canon of the Tanakh and the typical canon of the Septuagint and therefore, also from the writings known today as the Deuterocanon. One possible reason for Jewish rejection of the book might be the textual nature of several early sections of the book that make use of material from the Torah; for example, 1 En 1 is a midrash of Deuteronomy 33. The content, particularly detailed descriptions of fallen angels, would also be a reason for rejection from the Hebrew canon at this period -- as illustrated by the comments of Trypho the Jew when debating with Justin Martyr on this subject: ``The utterances of God are holy, but your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been explained by you; nay, even blasphemies, for you assert that angels sinned and revolted from God.''"

        "answer": true,
        "passage": "In modern usage, with the advent of digital typography, ``font'' is frequently synonymous with ``typeface''. In particular, the use of ``vector'' or ``outline'' fonts means that different sizes of a typeface can be dynamically generated from one design. Each style may still be in a separate ``font file''--for instance, the typeface ``Bulmer'' may include the fonts ``Bulmer roman'', ``Bulmer italic'', ``Bulmer bold'' and ``Bulmer extended''--but the term ``font'' might be applied either to one of these alone or to the whole typeface."

        "question": "is it legal to use a social security number for identification",
        "answer": true,
        "passage": "Many countries issued such numbers for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States developed its Social Security number (SSN) system as a means of organizing disbursing of Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become used for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car. Although some countries are required to collect Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) information for overseas payment procedures, some countries, like the US, are not required to collect other nations' TIN if other requirements are met, such as date of birth. Authorities use databases and they need a unique identifier in order to be that data actually refer to the searched person. In countries where there is no established nationwide number, authorities need to create their own number for each person, though there is a risk of mismatching people."

        "question": "is the normal force on a body always equal to its weight",
        "answer": false,
        "passage": "In a simple case such as an object resting upon a table, the normal force on the object is equal but in opposite direction to the gravitational force applied on the object (or the weight of the object), that is, N = m g (\\displaystyle N=mg) , where m is mass, and g is the gravitational field strength (about 9.81 m/s on Earth). The normal force here represents the force applied by the table against the object that prevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table is sturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking. However, it is easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction force pairs (a common mistake). In this case, the normal force and weight need to be equal in magnitude to explain why there is no upward acceleration of the object. For example, a ball that bounces upwards accelerates upwards because the normal force acting on the ball is larger in magnitude than the weight of the ball."

It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal reflux, which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa."

        "question": "can an employer tell you not to use the bathroom",
        "answer": false,
        "passage": "Workers' right to access restroom refers to the rights of employees to take a break when they need to use the bathroom. The right to access a bathroom is a basic human need. Unless both the employee and employer agree to compensate the employee on rest breaks an employer cannot take away the worker's right to access a restroom while working. There is limited information on the rights workers have to access bathrooms among the world's legal systems. The law is not clear in New Zealand, United Kingdom, or the United States of America as to the amount of time a worker is entitled to use a restroom while working. Nor is there clarification on what constitutes a 'reasonable' amount of access to a restroom. Consequently, the lack of access to toilet facilities has become a health issue for many workers. Issues around workplace allowance to use a restroom has given light on issues such as workers having to ask permission to use a toilet and some workers having their pay deducted for the mere human right of using a bathroom when they need to."
