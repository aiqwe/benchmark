        "Description of Expertise": "My field of research is astrophysics. To be more specific, I work on active galactic nuclei (AGN). I am interested in the physics of accretion and outflows, and also in using the supermassive blackholes (SMBHs) that power the AGN phenomena as astrophysical and cosmological tools. To study accretion and outflows, I utilize multiwavelength spectroscopy (IR, optical, UV, and X-ray) and simulations, with the photoionization code CLOUDY. In my research on SMBHs as tools, I rely on investigating scaling relations between the SMBH masses and the properties of the host galaxies in order to shed light on the formation and evolution of galaxies in general. As an extension of accretion physics investigation, I am interested in investigating the possibility of AGN jets launching ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). As a cosmological tool, I am working on the use of quasars, a bright class of distant AGN, as standard candles to build a quasar Hubble diagram in order to probe the equation of state of dark energy. Using AGN as astrophysical and cosmological tools requires accurate masses of the SMBHs. I am investigating the use of machine learning techniques to accurately and efficiently determine the SMBH masses of large AGN samples.\n\nSubjects that I teach/taught at the undergraduate level:\n1) Newtonian Mechanics\n2) Modern Physics\n3) Optics\n4) Analytical Mechanics\n5) Quantum Mechanics\n6) Statistical Mechanics\n7) Intro to Astro\n8) Astrophysics (Celestial astronomy, stellar astrophysics, galactic astrophysics, cosmology).\n9) Special Relativity\n10) General Relativity\n11) Electromagnetism\n12) Elementary particle physics\nIn short, virtually ALL fields of physics, except condensed matter physics.\n\nSubjects that I teach/taught at the graduate level:\n1) Radiative Processes\n2) Astrophysics of Galaxies\n3) Cosmology\n4) Active Galactic Nuclei\n5) Techniques and Instrumentation in Astrophysics\n6) Observational Astrophysics",
