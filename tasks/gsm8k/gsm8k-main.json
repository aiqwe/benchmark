Stan caught 13 pieces.  Julie caught half the amount of candy as Tabitha caught and Carlos caught twice as much candy as Stan.  How many pieces in total did the friends catch?",
        "answer": "Julie caught half the amount of Tabitha's 22 pieces so 22/2 = <<22/2=11>>11 pieces of candy caught by Julie\nCarlos caught twice the amount of candy as Stan's 13 pieces so 2 * 13 = <<2*13=26>>26 pieces of candy caught by Carlos\nAll together, Tabitha caught 22 pieces, Stan had 13, Julie had 11 and Carlos had 26, so there were a total of 22+13+11+26 = <<22+13+11+26=72>>72 pieces of candy\n#### 72"

The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?",
        "answer": "After the first day, Ezekiel had 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 kilometers of the hike left.\nOn the second day, he covered 50 / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 kilometers.\nTherefore, on the third day, he had 40 - 25 = <<40-25=15>>15 kilometers left to finish the hike.\n#### 15"

Billy wins the competition by finishing his laps 30 seconds before Margaret does. In seconds, how long did it take Billy to swim his final lap?",
        "answer": "Margaret finished all of her laps in 10 minutes * 60 seconds = <<10*60=600>>600 seconds.\nBilly’s first 5 laps took 2 minutes * 60 seconds = <<2*60=120>>120 seconds.\nHis next 3 laps took 4 minutes * 60 seconds = <<4*60=240>>240 seconds.\nHis ninth lap took 1 minute * 60 seconds = <<1*60=60>>60 seconds.\nSo his first 9 laps took 120 + 240 + 60 = <<120+240+60=420>>420 seconds.\nBilly finished swimming his laps before Margaret so all of his laps took a total of 600 – 30 = <<600-30=570>>570 seconds.\nThis means that it took 570 seconds in total swimming time – 420 seconds in time spent swimming the first 9 laps = 150 seconds for Billy to swim his final lap.\n#### 150"
