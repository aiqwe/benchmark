                "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a cricket field, at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a wicket, a set of three wooden stumps sited at each end. One team, designated the batting team, attempts to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents field. Each phase of play is called an innings. After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a set number of overs have been completed, the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles. The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained, during their period batting. \n\nAt the start of each game, two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play. The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team, known as the bowler, delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other, towards a set of wooden stumps, in front of which stands one of the batsmen, known as the striker. The striker's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat, and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs. The other batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler. The bowler's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman, at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease.\n\nThe most common forms of dismissal are bowled, when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball, leg before wicket, when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat, and caught, when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground. Runs are scored through two main methods: either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary, or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball. If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground, a run-out occurs. Adjudication is performed on-field by two umpires.\n\nThe laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). There are various formats ranging from Twenty20, played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs, to Test cricket, played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard, solid object made of compressed leather enclosing a cork core.\n\nAlthough cricket's origins are uncertain, it is first recorded in south-east England in the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, leading to the first international matches in the mid-19th century. ICC, the game's governing body, has over 100 members, ten of which are full members who play Test cricket. Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport, after association football, and is followed primarily in Australasia, Great Britain and Ireland, the Indian subcontinent, southern Africa and the West Indies.\n\nEtymology\n\nA number of words have been suggested as sources for the term \"cricket\". In the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598 it is called creckett.  One possible source for the name is the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.Birley, p. 3. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from \"cryce, Saxon, a stick\".  In Old French, the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick. Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch  krick(-e), meaning a stick (crook). Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.  According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").  Dr Gillmeister believes that not only the name but the sport itself is of Flemish origin. \n\nHistory\n\nCricket can definitely be traced back to Tudor times in early 16th-century England though there have been a number of claims, many of them spurious and/or lacking evidence, supporting earlier dates from 1301. The earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a 1598 court case which mentions that \"creckett\" (sic) was played on common land in Guildford around 1550. The court in Guildford heard on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date, equating to the year 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) from a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that when he was a scholar at the \"Free School at Guildford\", fifty years earlier, \"hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play [on the common land] at creckett and other plaies.\" Altham, p. 21.\n\nIt is believed that cricket was originally a children's game but references around 1610 indicate that adults had started playing it and the earliest reference to inter-parish or village cricket occurs soon afterwards. In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.McCann, pp. xxxiii–xxxiv. During the 17th century, numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of England. By the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that the first professionals appeared in the years following the Restoration in 1660. A newspaper report survives of \"a great cricket match\" with eleven players a side that was played for high stakes in Sussex in 1697, and this is the earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance. \n\nThe game underwent major development in the 18th century. Betting played a key part in that development with rich patrons forming their own \"select XIs\". Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season. Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old \"hockey stick\" shape. The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw). \n\nThe 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling. Both developments were controversial. Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839, which ultimately formed the official County Championship in 1890. Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in India, North America, the Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between the United States and Canada. In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tour. \n\nThe first Australian team to tour overseas was a team of Aboriginal stockmen who travelled to England in 1868 to play matches against county teams.  In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia. The most famous player of the 19th century was W. G. Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865. \n\nIn 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia. The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882 and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest. Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England. \n\nThe last two decades before the First World War have been called the \"Golden Age of cricket\". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed. \n\nThe inter-war years were dominated by one player: Australia's Don Bradman, statistically the greatest batsman of all time. Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the West Indies, India and New Zealand before the Second World War and then Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh in the post-war period. South Africa was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 because of its government's apartheid policy.\n\nCricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant. As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased. The first Limited Overs International was played in 1971. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) saw its potential and staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975. In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20, has made an immediate impact.\n\nRules and game-play\n\nCricket is a bat and ball game, played between two teams of eleven players each.   One team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen. The objective of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent. In some forms of cricket, it may also be necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn.\n\nFormat of the game\n\nA cricket match is divided into periods called innings (which ends with \"s\" in both singular and plural form). It is decided before the match whether the teams will have one innings or two innings each. During an innings one team fields and the other bats. The two teams switch between fielding and batting after each innings. All eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but only two members of the batting team (two batsmen) are on the field at any given time. The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.\n\nA coin toss is held by the team captains (who are also players) just before the match starts: the winner decides whether to bat or field first.\n\nThe cricket field is usually circular or oval in shape, with a rectangular pitch at the center. The edge of the playing field is marked with a boundary, which could be a fence, part of the stands, a rope or a painted line.\n\nAt each end of the pitch is a wooden target called a wicket, placed 22 yards apart. The pitch is marked with painted lines: a bowling crease in line with the wicket, and a batting or popping crease four feet in front of it. The wicket is made of three vertical stumps supporting two small horizontal bails. A wicket is put down if at least one bail is dislodged, or one stump is knocked down (usually by the ball, but also if the batsman does it with his body, clothing or equipment). This is also described as breaking, knocking down, or hitting the wicket - though if the ball hits the wicket but does not dislodge a bail or stump then it is not considered to be down.\n\nAt any instant each batsman owns a particular wicket (usually the one closer to him) and, except when actually batting, is safe when he is in his ground. This means that at least one part of his body or bat is touching the ground behind the popping crease. If his wicket is put down while the ball is live and he is out of his ground then he is dismissed, but the other batsman is safe. \n\nThe two batsmen take positions at opposite ends of the pitch. One designated member of the fielding team, called the bowler, bowls the ball from one end of the pitch to the striking batsman at the other end. The batsman at the bowling end is called the non-striker, and stands to the side of his wicket, behind his crease. The batsman are allowed to step forward of their creases, though at some risk. Another member of the fielding team, the wicket keeper, is positioned behind the striker's wicket.\n\nThe fielding team's other nine members stand outside the pitch, spread out across the field. The fielding captain often strategically changes their position between balls.\n\nThere is always an umpire at each end of the pitch.\n\nThe bowler usually retreats a few yards (metres) behind the wicket, runs towards it (his run-up), and then releases the ball over-hand as he reaches the bowling crease. (If he crosses the crease before he releases the ball, or if he flexes his elbow too much in a throw, then it is a no ball, and the batting team gets a penalty or extra run. If the ball passes the far wicket out of reach of the batsman then it is called a wide, also with an extra run.) The ball can be bowled so that it bounces on the pitch, lands exactly on the crease (a yorker), or crosses the crease without bouncing (a full toss).\n\nThe batsman tries to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket by striking the ball with his bat. (This includes the handle of the bat, and his gloves.) If the bowler succeeds in putting down the wicket the batsman is dismissed and is said to be bowled out. If the batsman misses the ball, but any part of his body prevents it from reaching the wicket, then he is out leg before wicket, or \"LBW\".\n\nIf the batsman hits the ball but it is caught by a fielder without bouncing then he is caught out. If it is caught by the bowler then he is caught and bowled; by the wicket keeper, caught behind.\n\nIf the batsman is successful in striking the ball and it is not caught without bouncing, then the two batsmen may try to score points (runs) for their team. Both batsmen run the length of the pitch, exchanging positions, and grounding their bats behind the opposite crease. Each crossing and grounding by both batsmen is worth one run. The batsmen may attempt one run, multiple runs, or elect not to run at all. By attempting runs, the batsmen risk dismissal. This happens if the fielding team retrieves the ball and hits either wicket with the ball (either by throwing it, or while holding it) before the batsman who owns that wicket reaches his ground behind the crease. The dismissed batsman is run out. Batsmen will sometimes start to run, change their mind, and return to their original positions.\n\nIf the batsman hits the ball over the field boundary without the ball touching the field, the batting team scores six runs. If the ball touches the ground and then reaches the boundary, the batting team scores four runs. The batsmen might start running before the ball reaches the boundary, but those runs don't count.\n\nIf the batsman misses the ball they can still attempt extra runs : these are called byes. If the ball bounces off his body then it is called a leg bye.\n\nIf the striking batsman leaves his ground and misses the ball, then the wicket keeper can catch it and put down the wicket – stumped.\n\nIn case of a no ball or a wide the batsman can choose to strike the ball, earning runs in addition to the fixed penalty. If he does so he can only be dismissed by being run out.\n\nWhen the batsmen have finished attempting their runs the ball is dead, and is returned to the bowler to be bowled again. The ball becomes live when he starts his run up. The bowler continues to bowl toward the same wicket, regardless of any switch of the batsmen's positions. \n\nA batsman may retire from an innings without being dismissed, usually after reaching a milestone like a hundred runs (a century).\n\nA dismissed batsman leaves the field, to be replaced by another batsman from the batting team. However, even though the wicket may have been put down, or the ball caught, the batsman is not actually dismissed until the fielding team appeal to the umpires for a decision, traditionally using the expression \"How's that\" (or \"Howzat\"). In some matches, particularly test matches, either team may request a review by a third umpire who can use a decision review system (DRS), which includes TV replays and other electronic equipment such as Hawk-Eye, Hot Spot and the Snickometer.\n\nAfter a bowler has bowled six times (an over), another member of the fielding team is designated as the new bowler, the old bowler taking up a fielding position. The batsmen stay in place, and the new bowler bowls to the opposite wicket, so the role of striker and non-striker reverse. The wicket keeper and the two umpires always change positions, as do many of the fielders, and play continues. Fielding team members may bowl multiple times during an innings, but may not bowl two overs in succession.\n\nThe innings is complete when 10 of the 11 members of the batting team have been dismissed (all out - although one always remaining \"not out\"), when a set number of overs has been played, or when the batting team declares that they have enough runs.\n\nThe number of innings and the number of overs per innings vary depending on the format of the match. In a match which is not a limited overs format the umpires will usually specify that the last session of the last innings will have a specified number of overs.\n\nThe match always ends when all innings have been completed. The umpires can also call an end to the match in case of bad light or weather. But in many cases the match ends immediately when the first team to bat has played all of its innings, and the last team to bat has more runs. In four-innings games the last team may not even need to play its second innings: this team is said to win by an innings. If this winning team has not completed its last innings, and still has, for example, five batsmen who are not out or have not even batted, then they are said to \"win by five wickets\". If the last team to bat is losing, is all out, and has 10 fewer runs than the other team, then the winning team \"wins by 10 runs\". If the two teams both play all their innings and they have the same number of runs, then it is a tie.\n\nIn four-innings matches there is also the possibility of a draw: the team with fewer runs still has batsmen on the field when the game ends. This has a major effect on strategy: a team will often declare an innings when they have accumulated enough runs, in the hope that they will have enough time left to dismiss the other team and thus avoid a draw, but risking a loss if the other team scores enough runs.\n\nPitch, wickets and creases\n\nPlaying surface\n\nCricket is played on a grassy field.  The Laws of Cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field,  but it is often oval. In the centre of the field is a rectangular strip, known as the pitch.\n\nThe pitch is a flat surface 10 ft wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses.  At either end of the pitch, 22 yd apart, are placed wooden targets, known as the wickets. These serve as a target for the bowling (also known as the fielding) side and are defended by the batting side, which seeks to accumulate runs.\n\nStumps, bails and creases\n\nEach wicket on the pitch consists of three wooden stumps placed vertically, in line with one another. They are surmounted by two wooden crosspieces called bails; the total height of the wicket including bails is  and the combined width of the three stumps, including small gaps between them is 9 in.\n\nFour lines, known as creases, are painted onto the pitch around the wicket areas to define the batsman's \"safe territory\" and to determine the limit of the bowler's approach. These are called the \"popping\" (or batting) crease, the bowling crease and two \"return\" creases.\n\nThe stumps are placed in line on the bowling creases and so these creases must be 22 yd apart. A bowling crease is 8 ft long, with the middle stump placed dead centre. The popping crease has the same length, is parallel to the bowling crease and is 4 ft in front of the wicket. The return creases are perpendicular to the other two; they are adjoined to the ends of the popping crease and are drawn through the ends of the bowling crease to a length of at least 8 ft.\n\nWhen bowling the ball, the bowler's back foot in his \"delivery stride\" must land within the two return creases while at least some part of his front foot must land on or behind the popping crease. If the bowler breaks this rule, the umpire calls \"No ball\".\n\nThe importance of the popping crease to the batsman is that it marks the limit of his safe territory. He can be dismissed stumped or run out (see Dismissals below) if the wicket is broken while he is \"out of his ground\".\n\nBat and ball\n\nThe essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers the ball from his end of the pitch towards the batsman who, armed with a bat is \"on strike\" at the other end.\n\nThe bat is made of wood (usually White Willow) and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than  wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 in.\n\nThe ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 in. The hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 90 mph, is a matter for concern and batsmen wear protective clothing including pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves for the hands, a helmet for the head and a box inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area). Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The ball has a \"seam\": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent, and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During cricket matches, the quality of the ball changes to a point where it is no longer usable, and during this decline its properties alter and thus influence the match. Players will therefore attempt to changes the properties of the ball in order to influence its flight. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing, while rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam is illegal ball tampering.\n\nUmpires and scorers\n\nThe game on the field is regulated by two umpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called \"square leg\", a position 15–20 metres to the side of the \"on strike\" batsman. The main role of the umpires is to adjudicate on whether a ball is correctly bowled (not a no ball or a wide), when a run is scored, and whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase How's That?). Umpires also determine when intervals start and end, decide on the suitability of the playing conditions and can interrupt or even abandon the match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.\n\nOff the field and in televised matches, there is often a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test matches and limited overs internationals played between two ICC full members. These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws of cricket and the spirit of the game.\n\nThe match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire. For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws of cricket to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.\n\nInnings\n\nThe innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for the collective performance of the batting side.  In theory, all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they all do so. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has one or two innings apiece.\n\nThe main aim of the bowler, supported by his fielders, is to dismiss the batsman. A batsman when dismissed is said to be \"out\" and that means he must leave the field of play and be replaced by the next batsman on his team. When ten batsmen have been dismissed (i.e., are out), then the whole team is dismissed and the innings is over. The last batsman, the one who has not been dismissed, is not allowed to continue alone as there must always be two batsmen \"in\". This batsman is termed \"not out\".\n\nAn innings can end early for three reasons: because the batting side's captain has chosen to \"declare\" the innings closed (which is a tactical decision), or because the batting side has achieved its target and won the game, or because the game has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time. In each of these cases the team's innings ends with two \"not out\" batsmen, unless the innings is declared closed at the fall of a wicket and the next batsman has not joined in the play.\n\nIn limited overs cricket, there might be two batsmen still \"not out\" when the last of the allotted overs has been bowled.\n\nOvers\n\nThe bowler bowls the ball in sets of six deliveries (or \"balls\") and each set of six balls is called an over. This name came about because the umpire calls \"Over!\" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can bowl unchanged at the same end for several overs. The batsmen do not change ends and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at square leg now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa.\n\nTeam structure\n\nA team consists of eleven players. Depending on his or her primary skills, a player may be classified as a specialist batsman or bowler. A well-balanced team usually has five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers. Teams nearly always include a specialist wicket-keeper because of the importance of this fielding position. Each team is headed by a captain who is responsible for making tactical decisions such as determining the batting order, the placement of fielders and the rotation of bowlers.\n\nA player who excels in both batting and bowling is known as an all-rounder. One who excels as a batsman and wicket-keeper is known as a \"wicket-keeper/batsman\", sometimes regarded as a type of all-rounder. True all-rounders are rare as most players focus on either batting or bowling skills.\n\nBowling\n\nThe bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a \"run-up\", although some bowlers with a very slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. A fast bowler needs momentum and takes quite a long run-up, running very fast as he does so.\n\nThe fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 90 mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile. Some fast bowlers make use of the seam of the ball so that it \"curves\" or \"swings\" in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball touches the edge of the bat and can then be \"caught behind\" by the wicketkeeper or a slip fielder.\n\nAt the other end of the bowling scale is the \"spinner\" who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman. A spinner will often \"buy his wicket\" by \"tossing one up\" (in a slower, higher parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot. The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often \"flighted\" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be \"trapped\" into getting himself out.\n\nIn between the pacemen and the spinners are the \"medium pacers\" who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration.\n\nAll bowlers are classified according to their looks or style. The classifications, as with much cricket terminology, can be very confusing. Hence, a bowler could be classified as LF, meaning he is a left arm fast bowler; or as LBG, meaning he is a right arm spin bowler who bowls deliveries that are called a \"leg break\" and a \"Googly\".\n\nDuring the bowling action the elbow may be held at any angle and may bend further, but may not straighten out. If the elbow straightens illegally then the square-leg umpire may call no-ball: this is known as \"throwing\" or \"chucking\", and can be difficult to detect. The current laws allow a bowler to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less.\n\nFielding\n\nAll eleven players on the fielding side take the field together. One of them is the wicket-keeper aka \"keeper\" who operates behind the wicket being defended by the batsman on strike. Wicket-keeping is normally a specialist occupation and his primary job is to gather deliveries that the batsman does not hit, so that the batsmen cannot run byes. He wears special gloves (he is the only fielder allowed to do so), a box over the groin, and pads to cover his lower legs. Owing to his position directly behind the striker, the wicket-keeper has a good chance of getting a batsman out caught off a fine edge from the bat. He is the only player who can get a batsman out stumped.\n\nApart from the one currently bowling, the other nine fielders are tactically deployed by the team captain in chosen positions around the field. These positions are not fixed but they are known by specific and sometimes colourful names such as \"slip\", \"third man\", \"silly mid on\" and \"long leg\". There are always many unprotected areas.\n\nThe captain is the most important member of the fielding side as he determines all the tactics including who should bowl (and how); and he is responsible for \"setting the field\", though usually in consultation with the bowler.\n\nIn all forms of cricket, if a fielder gets injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him. The substitute cannot bowl, act as a captain or keep wicket. The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.\n\nBatting\n\nAt any one time, there are two batsmen in the playing area. One takes station at the striker's end to defend the wicket as above and to score runs if possible. His partner, the non-striker, is at the end where the bowler is operating.\n\nBatsmen come in to bat in a batting order, decided by the team captain. The first two batsmen - the \"openers\" - usually face the hostile bowling from fresh fast bowlers with a new ball. The top batting positions are usually given to the most competent batsmen in the team, and the team's bowlers - who are typically, but not always, less skilled as batsmen - typically bat last. The pre-announced batting order is not mandatory; when a wicket falls any player who has not yet batted may be sent in next.\n\nIf a batsman \"retires\" (usually due to injury) and cannot return, he is actually \"not out\" and his retirement does not count as a dismissal, though in effect he has been dismissed because his innings is over. Substitute batsmen are not allowed.\n\nA skilled batsman can use a wide array of \"shots\" or \"strokes\" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an \"edge\". Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply \"blocking\" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run.\n\nThere is a wide variety of shots played in cricket. The batsman's repertoire includes strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., \"cut\", \"drive\", \"hook\", \"pull\".\n\nA batsman is not required to play a shot; in the event that he believes the ball will not hit his wicket and there is no opportunity to score runs, he can \"leave\" the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. He can deliberately use his leg to block the ball and thereby \"pad it away\" but this is risky because of the leg before wicket rule.\n\nIn the event of an injured batsman being fit to bat but not to run, the umpires and the fielding captain were previously able to allow another member of the batting side to be a runner. The runner's only task was to run between the wickets instead of the incapacitated batsman, and he was required to wear and carry exactly the same equipment as the batsman. As of 2011 the ICC outlawed the use of runners as they felt this was being abused. \n\nRuns\n\nThe primary concern of the batsman on strike (i.e., the \"striker\") is to prevent the ball hitting the wicket and secondarily to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score.\n\nMore than one run can be scored from a single hit; but, while hits worth one to three runs are common, the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more. To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. The batsmen do not need to run if the ball reaches or crosses the boundary.\n\nHits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of \"overthrows\" by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.\n\nThe decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: \"yes\", \"no\" and \"wait\" are often heard.\n\nRunning is a calculated risk because if a fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman is out of his ground (i.e., he does not have part of his body or bat in contact with the ground behind the popping crease), the batsman is run out.\n\nA team's score is reported in terms of the number of runs scored and the number of batsmen that have been dismissed. For example, if five batsmen are out and the team has scored 224 runs, they are said to have scored 224 for the loss of 5 wickets (commonly shortened to \"224 for five\" and written 224/5 or, in Australia, \"five for 224\" and 5/224).\n\nExtras\n\nAdditional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called \"sundries\" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways:\n# No ball: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules of bowling either by (a) using an inappropriate arm action; (b) overstepping the popping crease; (c) having a foot outside the return crease. In addition, the bowler has to re-bowl the ball. In limited overs matches, a no ball is called if the bowling team's field setting fails to comply with the restrictions. In shorter formats of the game (20–20, ODI) the free hit rule has been introduced. The ball following a front foot no-ball will be a free-hit for the batsman, whereby he is safe from losing his wicket except for being run-out.\n# Wide: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach; as with a no ball, a wide must be re-bowled. If a wide ball crosses the boundary, five runs are awarded to the batting side (one run for the wide, and four for the boundary).\n# Bye: extra(s) awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicketkeeper to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way (note that one mark of a good wicketkeeper is one who restricts the tally of byes to a minimum).\n# Leg bye: extra(s) awarded if the ball hits the batsman's body, but not his bat, while attempting a legitimate shot, and it goes away from the fielders to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way.\n\nWhen the bowler has bowled a no ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball. The batsmen have to run (i.e., unless the ball goes to the boundary for four) to claim byes and leg byes but these only count towards the team total, not to the striker's individual total for which runs must be scored off the bat.\n\nDismissals\n\nThere are eleven ways in which a batsman can be dismissed; five relatively common and six extremely rare. The common forms of dismissal are \"bowled\", \"caught\", \"leg before wicket\" (lbw), \"run out\", and \"stumped\". Less common methods are \"hit wicket\", \"hit the ball twice\", \"obstructed the field\", \"handled the ball\" and \"timed out\" - these are almost unknown in the professional game. The eleventh – retired out – is not treated as an on-field dismissal but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.\n\nIf the dismissal is obvious (for example when \"bowled\" and in most cases of \"caught\") the batsman will voluntarily leave the field without the umpire needing to dismiss them. Otherwise before the umpire will award a dismissal and declare the batsman to be out, a member of the fielding side (generally the bowler) must \"appeal\". This is invariably done by asking (or shouting) \"how's that?\" - normally reduced to howzat? If the umpire agrees with the appeal, he will raise a forefinger and say \"Out!\". Otherwise he will shake his head and say \"Not out\". Appeals are particularly loud when the circumstances of the claimed dismissal are unclear, as is always the case with lbw and often with run outs and stumpings.\n\n# Bowled: the bowler has hit the wicket with the delivery and the wicket has \"broken\" with at least one bail being dislodged (note that if the ball hits the wicket without dislodging a bail it is not out). \n# Caught: the batsman has hit the ball with his bat, or with his hand which was holding the bat, and the ball has been caught before it has touched the ground by a member of the fielding side. \n# Leg before wicket (lbw): the ball has hit the batsman's body (including his clothing, pads etc. but not the bat, or a hand holding the bat) when it would have gone on to hit the stumps. This rule exists mainly to prevent the batsman from guarding his wicket with his legs instead of the bat. To be given out lbw, the ball must not bounce outside leg stump or strike the batsmen outside the line of leg-stump. It may bounce outside off-stump. The batsman may only be dismissed lbw by a ball striking him outside the line of off-stump if he has not made a genuine attempt to play the ball with his bat. \n# Run out: a member of the fielding side has broken or \"put down\" the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman was out of his ground; this usually occurs by means of an accurate throw to the wicket while the batsmen are attempting a run, although a batsman can be given out Run out even when he is not attempting a run; he merely needs to be out of his ground. \n# Stumped is similar except that it is done by the wicketkeeper after the batsman has missed the bowled ball and has stepped out of his ground, and is not attempting a run.  A batsman can be run out on a No ball, but cannot be stumped.\n# Hit wicket: a batsman is out hit wicket if he dislodges one or both bails with his bat, person, clothing or equipment in the act of receiving a ball, or in setting off for a run having just received a ball. \n# Hit the ball twice is very unusual and was introduced as a safety measure to counter dangerous play and protect the fielders. The batsman may legally play the ball a second time only to stop the ball hitting the wicket after he has already played it. \"Hit\" does not necessarily refer to the batsman's bat. \n# Obstructing the field: another unusual dismissal which tends to involve a batsman deliberately getting in the way (physically and/or verbally) of a fielder. \n# Handled the ball: a batsman must not deliberately touch the ball with his hand, for example to protect his wicket. Note that the batsman's hand or glove counts as part of the bat while the hand is holding the bat, so batsmen are frequently caught off their gloves (i.e. the ball hits, and is deflected by, the glove and can then be caught). \n# Timed out; means that the next batsman was not ready to receive a delivery within three minutes of the previous one being dismissed. \n#Retired out: a batsman retires without the umpire's permission, and does not have the permission of the opposition captain to resume their innings. \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, it is the striker who is out when a dismissal occurs. If the non-striker is dismissed it is usually by being run out, but he could also be dismissed for obstructing the field, handling the ball or being timed out.\n\nA batsman may leave the field without being dismissed. If injured or taken ill the batsman may temporarily retire, and be replaced by the next batsman. This is recorded as retired hurt or retired ill. The retiring batsman is not out, and may resume the innings later. An unimpaired batsman may retire, and this is treated as being dismissed retired out; no player is credited with the dismissal. Batsmen cannot be out bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped or hit wicket off a no ball. They cannot be out bowled, caught, leg before wicket, or hit the ball twice off a wide. Some of these modes of dismissal can occur without the bowler bowling a delivery. The batsman who is not on strike may be run out by the bowler if he leaves his crease before the bowler bowls, and a batsman can be out obstructing the field or retired out at any time. Timed out is, by its nature, a dismissal without a delivery. With all other modes of dismissal, only one batsman can be dismissed per ball bowled.\n\nInnings closed\n\nAn innings is closed when:\n# Ten of the eleven batsmen are out (have been dismissed); in this case, the team is said to be \"all out\"\n# The team has only one batsman left who can bat, one or more of the remaining players being unavailable owing to injury, illness or absence; again, the team is said to be \"all out\"\n# The team batting last reaches the score required to win the match\n# The predetermined number of overs has been bowled (in a one-day match only, commonly 50 overs; or 20 in Twenty20)\n# A captain declares his team's innings closed while at least two of his batsmen are not out (this does not apply in one-day limited over matches)\n\nResults\n\nIf the team that bats last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, the team is said to have \"lost by n runs\" (where n is the difference between the number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have \"won by n wickets\", where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For instance a team that passes its opponents' score having only lost six wickets would have won \"by four wickets\".\n\nIn a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have won by an innings and n runs, and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores.\n\nIf the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side. In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw.\n\nIf the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of deliveries for each innings is often imposed. Such a match is called a \"limited overs\" or \"one-day\" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth-Lewis method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a \"no-result\" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.\n\nDistinctive elements\n\nIndividual focus\n\nFor a team sport, cricket places individual players under unusual scrutiny and pressure. Bowler, batsman, and fielder all act essentially independently of each other. While team managements can signal bowler or batsman to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is slightly mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for a long time.\n\nSpirit of the Game\n\nCricket is a unique game where in addition to the laws, the players must abide by the \"Spirit of the Game\".  The standard of sportsmanship has historically been considered so high that the phrase \"it's just not cricket\" was coined in the 19th century to describe unfair or underhanded behaviour in any walk of life. In the last few decades though, cricket has become increasingly fast-paced and competitive, increasing the use of appealing and sledging, although players are still expected to abide by the umpires' rulings without argument, and for the most part they do. Beginning in 2001, the MCC has held an annual lecture named after Colin Cowdrey on the spirit of the game.  Even in the modern game fielders are known to signal to the umpire that a boundary was hit, despite what could have been considered a spectacular save (though they might be found out by the TV replays anyway). In addition to this, some batsmen have been known to \"walk\" when they think they are out even if the umpire does not declare them out. This is a high level of sportsmanship, as a batsman can easily take advantage of incorrect umpiring decisions.\n\nInfluence of weather\n\nCricket is a sport played predominantly in the drier periods of the year. But, even so, the weather is a major factor in all cricket matches.\n\nA scheduled game of cricket cannot be played in wet weather. Dampness affects the bounce of the ball on the wicket and is a risk to all players involved in the game. Many grounds have facilities to cover the cricket pitch (or the wicket). Covers can be in the form of tarpaulins being laid over the wicket, elevated covers on wheels (acting like an umbrella) or even hover covers which form an airtight seal around the wicket. However, most grounds do not have the facilities to cover the outfield. This means that in the event of heavy bouts of bad weather, games may be cancelled, abandoned or suspended due to an unsafe outfield.\n\nAnother factor in cricket is the amount of light available. At grounds without floodlights (or in game formats which disallow the use of floodlights), umpires can stop play in the event of bad light as it becomes too difficult for the batsmen to be able to see the ball coming at them, (and in extreme cases, members of the fielding team).\n\nOn the other hand, in instances of good light, batsmen can use sight-screens which enable batsmen to have a white background against which they can pick out the red ball (or black background for white ball) with greater ease.\n\nThe umpires always have the final decision on weather-related issues.\n\nUniqueness of each field\n\nUnlike those of most sports, cricket playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the pitch and infield are specifically regulated, the Laws of Cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field. The field boundaries are sometimes painted and sometimes marked by a rope. Pitch and outfield variations can have a significant effect on how balls behave and are fielded as well as on batting. Pitches vary in consistency, and thus in the amount of bounce, spin, and seam movement available to the bowler. Hard pitches are usually good to bat on because of high but even bounce. Dry pitches tend to deteriorate for batting as cracks often appear, and when this happens to the pitch, spinners can play a major role. Damp pitches, or pitches covered in grass (termed \"green\" pitches), allow good fast bowlers to extract extra bounce. Such pitches tend to offer help to fast bowlers throughout the match, but become better for batting as the game goes on. While players of other outdoor sports deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardised. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ground. A given ground may acquire a reputation as batsman friendly or bowler friendly if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The absence of a standardised field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team makeup and players' statistical records.\n\nTypes of matches\n\nCricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats, varying playing standard and level of formality and the desired time that the match should last. A pertinent division in terms of professional cricket is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece, and those limited by number of overs, in which they have a single innings each. The former, known as first-class cricket, has a duration of three to five days (there have been examples of \"timeless\" matches too); the latter, known as limited overs cricket because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 or 20 overs, has a planned duration of one day only (a match can be extended if necessary due to bad weather, etc.).\n\nTypically, two-innings matches have at least six hours of playing time each day. Limited overs matches often last six hours or more. There are usually formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea with brief informal breaks for drinks. There is also a short interval between innings.\n\nAmateur cricketers rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided into declaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares; and limited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually. These will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the ever popular 20 over format during the evenings. Other forms of cricket, such as indoor cricket and garden cricket remain popular.\n\nHistorically, a form of cricket known as single wicket had been extremely successful and many of these contests in the 18th and 19th centuries qualify as major cricket matches. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began.\n\nTest cricket\n\nTest cricket is the highest standard of first-class cricket. A Test match is an international fixture between teams representing those countries that are Full Members of the ICC.\n\nAlthough the term \"Test match\" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–77 Australian season. Subsequently, eight other national teams have achieved Test status: South Africa (1889), West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1929), India (1932), Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992) and Bangladesh (2000). Zimbabwe suspended its Test status in 2006 due to its inability to compete against other Test teams,  and returned in 2011. \n\nWelsh players are eligible to play for England, which is in effect an England and Wales team. The West Indies team comprises players from numerous states in the Caribbean, notably Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago, the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands.\n\nTest matches between two teams are usually played in a group of matches called a \"series\". Matches last up to five days and a series normally consists of three to five matches. Test matches that are not finished within the allotted time are drawn. In the case of Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. \n\nSince 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes. Some other bilateral series have individual trophies too: for example, the Wisden Trophy is contested by England and West Indies; the Frank Worrell Trophy by Australia and West Indies and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia.\n\nLimited overs\n\nStandard limited overs cricket was introduced in England in the 1963 season in the form of a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other major cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England. Limited overs cricket has seen various innovations including the use of multi-coloured kit and floodlit matches using a white ball.\nA \"one day match\", named so because each match is scheduled for completion in a single day, is the common form of limited overs cricket played on an international level. In practice, matches sometimes continue on a second day if they have been interrupted or postponed by bad weather. The main objective of a limited overs match is to produce a definite result and so a conventional draw is not possible, but matches can be undecided if the scores are tied or if bad weather prevents a result. Each team plays one innings only and faces a limited number of overs, usually a maximum of 50. The Cricket World Cup is held in one day format and the last World Cup in 2015 was won by the co-hosts, Australia. The next World Cup will be hosted by England and Wales in 2019.\n\nTwenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session. The original idea, when the concept was introduced in England in 2003, was to provide workers with an evening entertainment. It was commercially successful and has been adopted internationally. The inaugural Twenty20 World Championship was held in 2007 and won by India. Subsequent events have been held which were won by Pakistan (2009), England (2010), West Indies (2012), and Sri Lanka (2014). The next tournament is scheduled to be held in 2016. After the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 many domestic Twenty20 leagues were born. First of them was Indian Cricket League which was a rebel league since it was not authorized by BCCI. BCCI then formed its official league called the Indian Premier League. The official league went on to become a successful annual affair that attracted players and audience around the globe, while the Indian Cricket League has been disbanded. After the success of Indian premier league many other domestic leagues were formed in all major cricketing nations. Recently Twenty20 Champions League was formed as a tournament for domestic clubs of various countries. In this league competition is between the top domestic teams from major cricketing nations.\n\nNational championships\n\nFirst-class cricket includes Test cricket but the term is generally used to refer to the highest level of domestic cricket in those countries with full ICC membership, although there are exceptions to this. First-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the County Championship. The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890. The most successful club has been Yorkshire County Cricket Club with 30 official titles.\n\nAustralia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the Sheffield Shield was introduced. In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states. New South Wales has won the maximum number of titles with 45 to 2008.\n\nNational championship trophies to be established elsewhere included the Ranji Trophy (India), Plunket Shield (New Zealand), Currie Cup (South Africa) and Shell Shield (West Indies). Some of these competitions have been updated and renamed in recent years.\n\nDomestic limited overs competitions began with England's Gillette Cup knockout in 1963. Countries usually stage seasonal limited overs competitions in both knockout and league format. In recent years, national Twenty20 competitions have been introduced, usually in knockout form though some incorporate mini-leagues.\n\nClub cricket\n\nClub cricket is a mainly amateur, but still formal, form of the sport of cricket, usually involving teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening. There is a great deal of variation in game format although the Laws of Cricket are always observed.\n\nClub cricket is frequently organised in a league or cup format. Games are limited by either time or overs. Limited overs games usually last between 20 and 60 overs per innings. A less common, but more traditional, format is limiting the game by time only. Games can range from a few hours in the evening to two days long. A modern innovation is the introduction of Twenty20 competitions, both as a format in the existing leagues and new leagues solely based on Twenty20, such as LastManStanding.\n\nStandards of play can vary from semi-professional to occasional recreational level and club cricket is often enjoyed as much for the social element as for the competition. Most clubs have their own ground to play on regularly, often including a field and pavilion or club house. An exception being 'Wandering Sides' who use other's grounds.\n\nMany leagues have been formed around the world of varying degrees of professionalism, the oldest being the Birmingham & District Premier League in the Birmingham area of England, founded in 1888.\n\nOther types of matches\n\nThere are numerous variations of the sport played throughout the world that include indoor cricket, French cricket, beach cricket, Kwik cricket and all sorts of card games and board games that have been inspired by cricket. In these variants, the rules are often changed to make the game playable with limited resources or to render it more convenient and enjoyable for the participants.\n\nIndoor Cricket was first invented in 1970.  It is similar to outdoor cricket except that is played in an indoor sports hall with 6 players per team. It is extremely popular in the UK with national championships and multiple independent leagues. Another less formal version of indoor cricket is played in a smaller arena with a soft ball and without pads was invented some years later and is commonly played in the Southern Hemisphere, and even has its own nominal international championships, including World Cups.\n\nIn the UK, garden cricket is a popular version of the sport, played in gardens and on recreation grounds around the country by adults and children alike. Although a cricket bat and ball are generally used, other equipment such as pads and gloves are not. The exact rules will vary based on the number of participants and the available space.\n\nFamilies and teenagers play backyard cricket or tennis ball cricket in suburban yards or driveways, and the cities of India and Pakistan play host to countless games of \"Gully Cricket\" or \"tape ball\" in their long narrow streets. Sometimes the rules are improvised: e.g. it may be agreed that fielders can catch the ball with one hand after one bounce and claim a wicket; or if only a few people are available then everyone may field while the players take it in turns to bat and bowl. Tennis balls and homemade bats are often used, and a variety of objects may serve as wickets: for example, the batter's legs as in French cricket, which did not in fact originate in France, and is usually played by small children.\n\nIn Kwik cricket, the bowler does not have to wait for the batsman to be ready before a delivery, leading to a faster, more exhausting game designed to appeal to children, which is often used in physical education lessons at UK schools. Another modification to increase the pace of the game is the \"Tip and Run\", \"Tipity\" Run, \"Tipsy Run\" or \"Tippy-Go\" rule, in which the batter must run when the ball touches the bat, even if it the contact is unintentional or minor. This rule, seen only in impromptu games, speeds the match up by removing the batsman's right to block the ball.\n\nIn Samoa a form of cricket called Kilikiti is played in which hockey stick-shaped bats are used. In original English cricket, the hockey stick shape was replaced by the modern straight bat in the 1760s after bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it. In Estonia, teams gather over the winter for the annual Ice Cricket tournament. The game juxtaposes the normal summer pursuit with harsh, wintry conditions. Rules are otherwise similar to those for the six-a-side game.\n\nInternational structure\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the international governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989.\n\nThe ICC has 104 members: 10 Full Members that play official Test matches, 34 Associate Members, and 60 Affiliate Members.  The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals. Each nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country. The cricket board also selects the national squad and organises home and away tours for the national team. In the West Indies these matters are addressed by the West Indies Cricket Board which consists of members appointed by four national boards and two multi-national boards.\n\nMembers\n\nFull Members\n\nFull Members are the governing bodies for cricket in a country or associated countries. Full Members may also represent a geographical area. All Full Members have a right to send one representative team to play official Test matches. Also, all Full Member nations are automatically qualified to play ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals. West Indies cricket team does not represent one country instead an amalgamation of over 20 countries from the Caribbean. The English Cricket team represents both England and Wales.\n\n*Last Updated: 9 February 2016  \n\nAResigned May 1961, readmitted 10 July 1991.\n\nTop Associate and Affiliate Members\n\nAll the associate and affiliate members are not qualified to play Test Cricket, however ICC grants One Day International status to its associate and affiliate members based on their success in the World Cricket League. The top six teams will be awarded One day international and Twenty20 International status, which will allow the associate and affiliate teams to be eligible to play the full members and play official ODI cricket.\n\nThe associate and affiliate teams who currently hold ODI and T20I status:\n\nCricket at international multi-sport events\n\nCricket was played as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics, when England and France contested a two-day match.  In 1998, cricket was played as part of the Commonwealth Games, on this occasion in the 50-over format. There was some talk about Twenty20 cricket being part of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, which were held in Delhi, but at the time the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), were not in favour of the short format of the game, and it was not included.  \n\nCricket was played in 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China  and 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.  India skipped both times.  There was further calls for subsequent Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games. The Commonwealth Games Federation asked the ICC to participate in the 2014 and 2018 Commonwealth Games, but the ICC turned down the invitation.  In 2010, the International Olympic Committee recognised cricket as a sport which could apply to be included in the Olympic Games,  but in 2013 the ICC announced that it had no intentions to make such an application, primarily due to opposition from the  BCCI. ESPNcricinfo suggested that the opposition might be based on the possible loss of income.  In April 2016, ICC chief executive Dave Richardson said that Twenty20 cricket can have a chance of getting in for the 2024 Summer Games, but there must be collective support shown by the ICC's membership base, in particular from BCCI, in order for there to be a chance of inclusion. \n\nStatistics\n\nOrganized cricket lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. At the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, one-day internationals, and first-class cricket are recorded separately. However, since Test matches are a form of first-class cricket, a player's first-class statistics will include his Test match statistics - but not vice versa. The Guide to Cricketers was a cricket annual edited by Fred Lillywhite between 1849 and his death in 1866. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was founded in 1864 by the English cricketer John Wisden (1826–1884) as a competitor to The Guide to Cricketers. Its annual publication has continued uninterrupted to the present day, making it the longest running sports annual in history.\n\nCertain traditional statistics are familiar to most cricket fans. The basic batting statistics include:\n* Innings (I): The number of innings in which the batsman actually batted.\n* Not outs (NO): The number of times the batsman was not out at the conclusion of an innings they batted in.\n* Runs (R): The number of runs scored.\n* Highest score (HS/Best): The highest score ever made by the batsman.\n* Batting average (Ave): The total number of runs divided by the total number of innings in which the batsman was out. Ave = Runs/[I - NO] (also Avge or Avg.)\n* Centuries (100): The number of innings in which the batsman scored one hundred runs or more.\n* Half-centuries (50): The number of innings in which the batsman scored fifty to ninety-nine runs (centuries do not count as half-centuries as well).\n* Balls faced (BF): The total number of balls received, including no balls but not including wides.\n* Strike rate (SR): The number of runs scored per 100 balls faced. (SR = [100 * Runs]/BF)\n* Run rate (RR): Is the number of runs a batsman (or the batting side) scores in an over of six balls.\n\nThe basic bowling statistics include:\n* Overs (O): The number of overs bowled.\n* Balls (B): The number of balls bowled. Overs is more traditional, but balls is a more useful statistic because the number of balls per over has varied historically.\n* Maiden overs (M): The number of maiden overs (overs in which the bowler conceded zero runs) bowled.\n* Runs (R): The number of runs conceded.\n* Wickets (W): The number of wickets taken.\n* No balls (Nb): The number of no balls bowled.\n* Wides (Wd): The number of wides bowled.\n* Bowling average (Ave): The average number of runs conceded per wicket. (Ave = Runs/W)\n* Strike rate (SR): The average number of balls bowled per wicket. (SR = Balls/W)\n* Economy rate (Econ): The average number of runs conceded per over. (Econ = Runs/overs bowled).\n\nScorecards\n\nA match's statistics are summarised on a scorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks. The earliest known scorecards were printed in 1776 by Pratt, scorer to the Sevenoaks Vine Cricket Club, but it was many years before his invention was widely adopted.  Scorecards were printed and sold at Lord's for the first time in 1846. \n\nThe introduction of scoreboards revolutionised cricket by allowing spectators to keep track of the day's play. In 1848, Fred Lillywhite used a portable printing press at grounds to print updated scorecards. In 1858, the Kennington Oval introduced the first mobile scorebox, \"a house on rollers with figures for telegraphing on each side\". In 1881, the Melbourne Cricket Ground erected the first cricket scoreboard. The scoreboard, located at the western end of the ground, gave the batsman's name and method of dismissal.\n\nCulture\n\nInfluence on everyday life\n\nCricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere. Cricket has had an influence on the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with such phrases as \"that's not cricket\" (unfair), \"had a good innings\", \"sticky wicket\", and \"bowled over\". There have been many cricket films. The term \"Bradmanesque\" from Don Bradman's name has become a generic term for outstanding excellence, both within cricket and in the wider world. \n\nThe amateur game has also been spread further afield by expatriates from the Test-playing nations.\n\nIn the arts and popular culture\n\nCricket is the subject of works by major English poets including William Blake and Lord Byron.Smart, Alastair (20 July 2013). [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/10191131/The-art-of-cricket-Enough-to-leave-you-stumped.html \"The art of cricket: Enough to leave you stumped\"], The Telegraph. Retrieved 12 March 2016. Beyond a Boundary (1963), written by Trinidadian C.L.R. James, is often named the best book on any sport, ever written.  In fiction, there is English author P. G. Wodehouse's 1909 novel, Mike.\n\nIn the visual arts, notable cricket paintings include Albert Chevallier Tayler's Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury (1907) and Russell Drysdale's The Cricketers (1948), which has been called \"possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century.\"  French impressionist Camille Pissarro painted cricket on a visit to England in the 1890s. Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batsman in motion. Caribbean artist Wendy Nanan’s cricket images  are featured in a limited edition first day cover for Royal Mail's \"World of Invention\" stamp issue,  celebrating the London Cricket Conference 1–3 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the celebrations leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup. \n\nThere are many cricket video games, including EA Sports Cricket 07.\n\nInfluence on other sports\n\nCricket has close historical ties with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports.  In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with \"a code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season. The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game.  It is typically played on modified cricket fields.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was responsible for the \"development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball\". The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick came to be known as Father of Baseball, and was an early inductee in the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
                "Dennis Leslie Amiss MBE (born 7 April 1943, Harborne, Birmingham, Warwickshire) is a former English cricketer and cricket administrator. He played for both Warwickshire and England. A right-handed batsman, Amiss was a stroke maker particularly through extra cover and midwicket – his two favourite areas to score runs. He was an accomplished batsman in all forms of the game. He averaged 42.86 in first-class, 35.06 in List-A, 46.30 in Tests and 47.72 in One Day Internationals. In first-class cricket he scored 102 centuries, and his England record amassed over 50 Tests ranks him with the best England has produced.\n\nAfter retiring as a player in 1987, he served Warwickshire as Chairman of the Cricket Committee, and he followed David Heath as chief executive from 1994 until 2006. In 1992 he was selected as an England selector.  In November 2007 he became the deputy chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board; in August 2011, The Daily Telegraph described his role on the board as providing \"cricketing knowledge and expertise [that] complemented Clarke’s business skills.\" \n\nEarly years\n\nAmiss suffered a serious back injury whilst playing football in his teenage years, which entailed him starting each day of his sporting life undergoing stretching routines to loosen up.\n\nEngland career \n\nAmiss made his Test debut for England in the fifth Test of the 1966 series with West Indies, and he proved an accomplished Test match batsman. He was one of the first batsmen to use a protective helmet. In scoring 3,612 Test runs, Amiss made eleven half-centuries and eleven centuries, including two double centuries against the West Indies. His highest Test match score, also his highest first-class score, was 262 not out against the West Indies in the 1973–74 Kingston Test, an innings that saved the Test match for England after they conceded a first innings lead of 230. The next highest score in England's innings was 38. After being dropped by England in 1975, he made a successful return against the West Indies at the Oval in the final Test of 1976, although his 203 in the first innings did not prevent England losing the match. Amiss's last Test came in 1977 when he was left out to make way for Geoff Boycott's return from self-imposed exile.\n\nHis former Warwickshire teammate, Jack Bannister, stated \"Dennis was always tinkering with his game, he was a bigger perfectionist than Colin Cowdrey\".\n\nAmiss was also a handy One Day International batsman scoring 859 runs, including four centuries and one half-century, with a top score of 137 against India which is still England's second highest individual score in the Cricket World Cup, behind the 158 scored by Andrew Strauss in 2011.  He has the distinction of scoring the first ever One Day International century (103 in only the second One Day International in 1972) which is also the first instance of a debutant scoring a century in ODI. Amiss along with Keith Fletcher is also credited to have shared the first ever partnership of hundred runs in the same match.  He ended with an ODI batting average of 47.72, which excepting those players to have played fewer than five times, remains the highest of any England batsman who has completed his career. The still-active Kevin Pietersen averaged over 50 throughout the first 60 matches of his ODI career up until September 2007, but that figure had fallen to under 41 by June 2011.\n\nAmiss played World Series Cricket in the late 1970s in Australia; during the 1978 World Series Cricket tournament, he became the first player to wear a batting helmet regularly.   \n\nAmiss was banned from Test cricket for three years for taking part in the first 'rebel' tour of South Africa in 1982.\n\nHonours\n\nAmiss was selected as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1975. \n\nAmiss was awarded an MBE in 1988; in 2007 he received a Doctor of the University from the University of Birmingham. \n\nRecords\n\nDennis Amiss is the first player in ODI cricket to have scored a century on both his debut and in his last match, the only other being Desmond Haynes.  On 7 June 1975 at Lord's in the first match of the Prudential World Cup (which was also the very first Cricket World Cup to have been held) Amiss smashed 137 runs in just 147 balls against India powered by 18 boundaries. His innings provided enough leverage for England to post a very imposing and improbable target of 335 for India to be chased down within a span of 60 overs. It was also the first time that a team would score 300 or more runs in an ODI match. The match also featured the infamous and notorious ODI innings of Sunil Gavaskar who in reply to the nearly unreachable target set by England scored an unbeaten 36 in 174 balls with just one boundary to adorn his innings."

                "Dame Elisabeth Jean Frink  (14 November 1930 – 18 April 1993) was an English sculptor and printmaker. Her Times obituary noted the three essential themes in her work as the nature of Man; the \"horseness\" of horses; and the divine in human form. \n\nCareer\n\nBorn in Thurlow, Suffolk, Frink studied at the Guildford School of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts) (1946–1949), under Willi Soukop, at the Chelsea School of Art (1949–1953). Part of a post war group of British sculptors, dubbed the Geometry of Fear school - that included Reg Butler, Bernard Meadows, Kenneth Armitage and Eduardo Paolozzi. Frink’s subject matter included men, birds, dogs, horses and religious motifs, but very seldom any female forms. Bird (1952; London, Tate), one of a number of bird sculptures, and her first successful pieces (also Three Heads and the Figurative Tradition) with its alert, menacing stance, characterizes her early work. \n\nAlthough she made many drawings and prints, she is best known for her bronze outdoor sculpture, which has a distinctive cut and worked surface. This is created by her adding plaster to an armature, which she then worked back into with a chisel and surform. This process contradicts the very essence of \"modeling form\" established in the modeling tradition and defined by Rodin's handling of clay. \n\nIn the 1960s Frink’s continuing fascination with the human form was evident in a series of falling figures and winged men. While living in France from 1967 to 1970, she began a series of threatening, monumental male heads, known as the goggled heads. On returning to England, she focused on the male nude, barrel-chested, with mask-like features, attenuated limbs and a pitted surface, for example Running Man (1976; Pittsburgh, PA, Carnegie Mus. A.). Frink’s sculpture, and her lithographs and etchings created as book illustrations, drew on archetypes expressing masculine strength, struggle and aggression. \n\nThe 1980s held capstones for Frink's career. In 1982, a new publishing firm proposed to produce a Catalogue Raisonné of all of her works to date; and the Royal Academy planned a retrospective of her life's work. The date of the retrospective, originally to be held in 1986, was moved forward a year due to space demands at the gallery, causing Frink some headaches due to her busy commissioned work schedule. In 1985 alone, she was committed to two major projects: a set of three figures for a corporate headquarters, one of which was a nearly 7 ft male nude; and the other, a grouping entitled Dorset Martyrs to be placed in Dorchester, Dorset.\n\nHowever, despite the potential for conflict, the retrospective was a success and spurred the art world to hold more exhibitions of Frink's worth, with four solo exhibitions and several group ones coming in the following year. Tirelessly, Frink continued to accept commissions and sculpt, as well as serve on advisory committees, meet with art students who had expressed an interest in her work, and pursue other public commitments. \n\nFrink kept up this hectic pace of sculpting and exhibiting until early 1991, when an operation for cancer of the oesophagus caused an enforced break. However, short weeks later Frink was again creating sculptures and preparing for solo exhibitions. In September, she underwent a second surgery. Again, Frink did not let this hold her back, proceeding with a planned trip for exhibitions to New Orleans, Louisiana, and New York City. The exhibitions were a success, but Frink's health was clearly deteriorating. Despite this, she was working on a colossal statue, Risen Christ, for Liverpool Cathedral. This sculpture would prove to be her last; just one week after its installation, Frink died from cancer on 18 April 1993, aged 62, in Blandford Forum, Dorset. Her husband had predeceased her by only a few months. \n\nStephen Gardiner, Frink's official biographer, argued that this final sculpture was appropriate: \"This awesome work, beautiful, clear and commanding, a vivid mirror-image of the artist's mind and spirit, created against fearful odds, was a perfect memorial for a remarkable great individual.\" \n\nWarhorse and Walking Madonna may be seen in the garden at Chatsworth House. Other work is at the Jerwood Sculpture Park at Ragley Hall. Uniquely in England, Desert Quartet (1990), Frink's penultimate sculpture, was given Grade II* listing in 2007, less than 30 years from its creation by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.  It may be seen opposite Liverpool Gardens in Worthing.\n\nThe Frink School of Figurative Sculpture 1996-2005\n\nBefore Frink died in 1993, she had given master classes at the Sir Henry Doulton School of Sculpture then headed by sculptor Colin Melborne ARA in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Rosemary Barnett took over as principal of the Sir Henry Doulton School of Sculpture, Stoke-on-Trent, briefly before its closure. In 1990 she met Harry Everington there and their shared artistic outlook brought about the Frink School of Figurative Sculpture which opened in 1996 in Longton and closed in 2005 at Tunstall. \n\nPermission from the Frink Estate was given to name a new school after her, because it was to continue the tradition which she represented. The Frink School of Figurative Sculpture opened in 1996, with an emphasis on sculptural form; it attempted to give some balance to the declining figurative training and increased conceptualism in sculpture schools in the UK.\n\nCultural reference\n\nFrink was one of five 'Women of Achievement' selected for a set of British stamps issued in August 1996. The others were Dorothy Hodgkin (scientist), Margot Fonteyn (ballerina / choreographer), Marea Hartman (sports administrator) and Daphne Du Maurier (writer).\n\nBiography and sources\n\n* Stephen Gardiner, Elisabeth Frink: The Official Biography.

                "Obituary: Dame Elisabeth Frink | The Independent\nObituary: Dame Elisabeth Frink\nSunday 18 April 1993 23:02 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nElisabeth Frink, sculptor: born Thurlow, Suffolk 14 November 1930; CBE 1969; RA 1977; DBE 1982; married 1955 Michel Jammet (one son; marriage dissolved 1963), 1964 Edward Pool (marriage dissolved 1974), 1974 Alexander Csaky (died 1993); died Woolland, Dorset 18 April 1993.\nELISABETH FRINK was a woman of great courage, integrity and style who gambled continuously against the odds, both in her work - against stylistic fashion or any kind of comfortable or ingratiating image - and in her life. She achieved the extraordinary distinction of becoming, without any compromise, a genuinely popular sculptor whose work is admired by a broad public in Britain and abroad. Her dogs and horses have their own authenticity, but the images of a single naked male figure, standing, walking or running, say something about endurance, vulnerability and essential human nature that haunts the memory.\nFrink came to maturity as a young sculptor in the mid-Fifties, encouraged from the very outset of her professional career by the attentive if not always respectful climate of support established for British sculpture internationally by Henry Moore. Before the Second World War, the only sculptures broadly visible to the general public in England were war memorials, equestrian statues or the occasional commemorative municipal plaque. Artists like Jacob Epstein, Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Maurice Lambert, Frank Dobson and Leon Underwood were confined to very small dealers' galleries, a tiny public and the odd leaden spoof among the cartoons in Punch.\nThe resilient theme of Moore's wartime Family Group series of bronzes and the harrowing topicality of his drawings, commissioned by Kenneth Clark for the War Artists' records, of tube shelterers made during the air raids, changed the British public's perception of how a sculptor could actually touch a national nerve. The successful arrival in the immediate post-war years of other prize-winning sculptors - Bernard Meadows, Kenneth Armitage, Lynn Chadwick, Reg Butler, Geoffrey Clarke among them, all about a decade older than Frink - confirmed the comparatively positive climate in which the young Frink found herself.\nIf Frink's professional context with its fresh opportunities came from Moore's wartime example and success, her imaginative world was also quite radically affected, if not fully formed, by the war. Her father was at Dunkirk as a professional soldier, and saw much action elsewhere; the family at home lived near an airfield in Suffolk where bombers often returned to base in flames. As a very young schoolgirl, Frink had to hide in the hedges from the machine-gun attack of a German fighter plane. As a 15-year-old schoolgirl, she watched on her local cinema screen the first appalling news pictures of Belsen. Her earliest drawings, even before she went to Chelsea School of Art in 1949, were powerful but grim in tone: wounded birds, apocalyptic horses and riders, falling men.\nLife in England was still harsh for at least a decade after the war, with the continuance of wartime rationing and the day-to-day reality, often lowering to the spirit, of an impoverished austerity. But the sombre mood of the times, still bleak in the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was all the same fortified by the hopes aroused through the formation of the United Nations Organisation and sheer relief at the cessation of hostilities. In the world of art, architecture and design there was even an expansive feeling of optimism which culminated in the celebratory 1951 Festival of Britain. There seemed to be a real opportunity for good young architects to repair cities devastated by bombing with new architecture. The Royal Festival Hall appeared on the South Bank.\nThose who worked in the art world were encouraged by the greatly expanded public for art created through the wartime efforts of CEMA, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, formed by Maynard Keynes, Kenneth Clark and others, the embryo of our post-war Arts Council. At CEMA, there was the startling discovery in the early years of the war that in many parts of the country quite large numbers of people had never seen an original work of art of any kind in their lives, a discovery which gave a real driving edge to the task of travelling exhibitions. Patricia Strauss, the wife of George Russell Strauss MP - who tried to persuade the Government to use half of 1 per cent of the cost of all new buildings for works of art - pioneered the first international sculpture exhibition in Battersea Park.\nA good measure of all this hope and idealism is reflected in Elisabeth Frink's sculpture as an extension of her own stoic and idealistic nature. Growing up in the country, close to animals and birds, Frink's sculptures of living creatures are by no means gloomy or painful. The early wounded birds, which preceded the images of men attempting to fly and helmeted and goggled airmen, soon gave place to idealised winged figures. Frink's great bronze horses became famous, ranging from standing or prancing horses to the memorable Rolling Horse of 1982; her sculptures of dogs, quizzical and alert, all seem equally forceful, convincing and unsentimental.\nBut, on certain occasions, Frink did not see animals only on their own terms. A recent, larger than life-sized bronze sculpture of a War Horse, huge, powerful and muscular as it is, still presents us with our culpability. As Frink said, 'They carried men into battle.' Also recently, a sequence of sculptures of baboons, in isolation, have great poignancy through their closeness to man. A recent project to sculpt on a large scale a seated man looking up at a crouching baboon which stares into space was not fulfilled. Neither was Frink's intention to find the right approach, sculpturally, to project on an equally large scale her image of The Green Man, an ancient symbol of regeneration and the fertility of spring, with branches sprouting from the head of a male figure.\nAfter Frink's early, quiet but very real success in the Fifties, her most testing time came in the Sixties and Seventies. An 'academic' work of art, in the pejorative sense of the word, merely leans on tradition or feeds upon convention without energising or expanding that tradition. As figurative imagery, Frink's sculptures always avoided the negatively 'academic' label through their extreme individuality of mood, given life through a highly personal approach to form. Frink consistently carved the wet plaster after rough preliminary modelling, creating a particular surface tension and concentration of form, and this remained her only debt to Moore - for there are no stylistic similarities. Her personal lodestar, if she had one, was always Alberto Giacometti. But in the Sixties, the 'new generation' of sculptors in England, following Anthony Caro's precepts, abandoned both modelling and carving in favour of assemblage, the art of creating form by the additive process - as opposed to the reductive process of carving or modelling - of putting together disparate elements, steel sheets or bars or found component parts from factories or steelyard waste. Brilliant colour and transparent materials were also involved and, although the new sculpture had its own variable mood, it was entirely abstract.\nTo some, Frink's sculpture looked increasingly old-fashioned rather than academic, with its recognisable imagery and insistence on the traditional substance and properties of bronze. But Frink continued to explore her expanding vision, ignored the strong pressures of fashion and proceeded to make her strongest and most characteristic work. Her public grew, together with critical recognition.\nFrink's earliest male figures are not so much tentative as distorted by effort or blurred by action. Gradually, through the later Sixties and Seventies, came a series of slightly larger than life-sized figures: walking, running, standing, in action or in contemplation, and these male figures, lean, bony, pared down to essential form but richly if tersely expressive, have some quality of timelessness and endurance which will remain Frink's unique contribution to sculpture, culminating in the weightier, more aggressive and harshly coloured warrior figures of recent years, inspired indirectly by the ancient Greek Riace bronze figures - larger than life-sized bronzes rescued from the sea by archaeologists off southern Italy. Affected by the discovery of Aboriginal art on a visit to Australia, Frink applied some startling colour-effects to these baleful figures which completely subdue in lurid presence their ancient Greek prototypes.\nAmong this long-drawn-out, varied and wholly unfashionable sequence of male figures, Frink made two very grand groups of monumental male heads. At the time of the Algerian war, Frink saw a photograph of a man called Oufkir who was held responsible for the death of the Algerian freedom fighter Ben Barka. The blank, thuggish face, given a sinister edge by impenetrable black spectacles, haunted Frink and her first goggle-head appeared.\nThen, in 1975, she made a monumental group of four male heads, with closed eyes and clearly modelled, serene features. These were the Tribute heads, referring to people who had died for their beliefs. 'In a sense, these sculptures are a tribute to Amnesty International,' the sculptor said. 'The heads represent the inhumanity of man - they are the heads of victims.' A more recent pair of monumental heads is called In Memoriam, with eyes open, and are an extension of the same theme: people who have been tortured for their beliefs.\nElisabeth Frink's strong feeling for the wretched suffering that seems so persistent in the modern world was extremely dry and unsloppy. She was wholly unsentimental as an artist, and her manner and way of talking was laconic, impulsive, full of humour, but also very decisive and rigorously practical. Privately, she was endlessly generous to good causes.\nShe grew up as a practising Catholic and a few of her commissions, honourably fulfilled, were for churches, although it is the secular work on public display that comes more swiftly to mind, like the horse and rider in Dover Street, London, the Dorset Martyrs in Dorchester, or the Shepherd with Three Lambs group for Paternoster Square. She made some very strong illustrations for Chaucer and Homer and some fine portrait busts, notably of Alec Guinness and John Pope- Hennessy. Her many studies of birds and animals are perhaps the most beautiful drawings of these subjects made since Henri Gaudier- Brzeska's death. Frink's sense of the world and its wonders as well as its horrors was perhaps broader and deeper than any specific religion could satisfy.\nA handsome woman with great spirit and presence, Elisabeth Frink was married three times: first in 1955 to Michel Jammet, whose family owned an old-established and celebrated restaurant in Dublin. Their son, Lin, a painter, was born in 1958. In 1964, Frink married Edward Pool, a distinguished war hero, and settled with him in France, in the country near the Camargue where she lived and worked until the mid-Seventies. In 1974, Frink married Alexander Csaky and settled in Dorset in an old country house with space for studies and unpretentious but spacious grounds which her sculptures inhabited as vigorously and unselfconsciously as her family with their horses and dogs. This final marriage was exceptionally happy: Alex Csaky was a cultivated businessman who loved horses, dogs and the country as much as he cherished his wife's work. The marriage ended very sadly earlier this year when Csaky died, following a stroke, while Frink was herself undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and fighting to complete her last commission: a monumental but grandly untraditional figure of a very strong Christ for the facade of the Anglican cathedral in Liverpool, unveiled seven days before her death.\n(Photograph omitted)",
                "Dame Elisabeth Frink: Major Survey Of Her Public Sculpture Announced - Artlyst\nDame Elisabeth Frink: Major Survey Of Her Public Sculpture Announced\n22 July 2015\n/  Art Categories Art News , News / Art Tags Dame Elisabeth Frink , The Djanogly Gallery / / / / /\nA major survey exhibition of Dame Elisabeth Frink’s public sculpture commissions has been announced opening 25 November 2015 at the The Djanogly Gallery in Nottingham. Conceived and organised in partnership with The Frink Estate & Archive, ‘The Presence of Sculpture’ will focus, for the first time, on presenting the journey from Frink’s private studio to the public realm of post-war Britain. Over 70 artworks will be displayed, while her practice will be revealed through never- before-seen archive material including recently conserved drawings, sculpture from her private collection, her tools and studio records, and original film footage and photographs of the artist at work.\nFrink received many commissions for social housing, religious buildings, New Towns and urban developments throughout her life, and these played an important part in her artistic career. The commissioned works – which can be seen in situ around Britain today – are represented in the gallery exhibition by full-scale bronze casts as well as editions, studies and maquettes. Significant sculpture groups will be represented, including the Dorset Martyrs, the Desert Quartet and Riace figures. The exhibition spans over 35 years of Frink’s oeuvre, from Blind Beggar and Dog (1957) – now on display at Bethnal Green in London – to Risen Christ (1993) which was unveiled in Liverpool’s Anglican Cathedral a few days before her death.\nDivided into four themes, ‘The Presence of Sculpture’ will exhibit celebrated subjects of Frink’s distinctive expressive bronzes – male figures, heads, metamorphic bird/beast shapes and animals. These motifs allowed the artist to explore our relationship with the natural world, and man’s power and vulnerability in the face of war, religion and daily life. Her Riace figures for instance, which were inspired by fifth-century Greek statues of warriors, examine human nature through their dichotomy of beauty and menace. The messages of her outdoor sculpture varied throughout her career, as she continued to develop new ways of using her chosen medium of plaster cast into bronze. The forms, surfaces, marks, scale and use of details evolved as she moved from building the plaster when semi-liquid to also carving it when dry.\nNever before have the workings of Elisabeth Frink’s mind been given shape so fully in an exhibition. Frink based herself in a succession of studios – in London, France and finally in Woolland, Dorset, where she lived and worked for the last 15 years of her life. Each of these personal spaces is presented through life-size photographs of Frink at work, while aspects of Woolland are uniquely recreated in the gallery. Throughout the 400 square metre gallery space, displays will include: sculptures and recently conserved drawings from her personal collection; fragile plasters unlikely to be exhibited again; the working contents of her studio, including her tools, the crates and stands she built her sculptures on; the chair that the subjects of her portraits, such as Alec Guinness, would have sat upon, and much more.\nAnnette Ratuszniak, Curator, The Frink Estate & Archive, said: “The commissions are woven into this evolving story and the exhibition provides a fascinating insight into Frink’s inspirations and working methods, and the significance of the ongoing presence of her commissioned work. Some have fared better than others – silent witnesses of changing places and communities in modern Britain.”\nProfessor Sir David Greenaway, Vice-Chancellor, The University of Nottingham commented: “We are tremendously excited to be presenting this major exhibition of Frink’s work at the University of Nottingham’s Djanogly Gallery in collaboration with the Frink Estate. In 2011-12, the gallery attracted record audience figures for its LOWRY exhibition. Both projects have received the very generous support from great friends of the University, Sir Harry and Lady Djanogly. We confidently expect that Frink’s abiding popular appeal will generate a similar high level of public interest”.\nElisabeth Frink is internationally recognised as a major 20th-century British sculptor. Her sculptures, drawings and prints were – and continue to be – widely exhibited and purchased for public and private collections throughout the world. Her reputation continues to grow alongside the recognition of her contribution to 20th- century sculptural language.\nShe was awarded a CBE in 1969, elected RA in 1977, and made a Dame in 1982. In June 1992, Queen Elizabeth II made her a Companion of Honour – an award conferred for national service. Recent exhibitions include a major retrospective at Lightbox, Woking (19 February – 21 April 2013).\nHer work is part of major collections around the world including Tate, Fitzwilliam Museum, Royal Academy of Arts, Scottish Gallery of Modern Art, Whitworth Gallery, Arts Council, British Museum, Joseph Hirshorn Collection and Museum of Modern Art, New York. Her work can also be seen on public display in Dover Street, London; Royal College of Physicians, London; Yorkshire Sculpture Park; Milton Keynes; Brixton Estates, Dunstable; Warwick University; Dorchester Hospital, Dorset; King’s College, Cambridge; Chatsworth House, Derbyshire and Exchange Square, Hong Kong among other locations.\nThe Frink Estate & Archive holds a representative range of the artist’s sculptures, drawings, prints, original plasters and foundry moulds as well as her private collection of artworks. It is based in Dorset, England, where she came to live with her husband Alex Csáky in 1976, and where she established her final studio. Related archival items including ephemera and images are held at the Dorset History Centre. The Frink Estate & Archive continues to administer her artworks under the direction of her son Lin Jammet with the curatorial assistance of Annette Ratuszniak\nThe Djanogly Gallery opened in 1992 and now forms part of Nottingham Lakeside Arts, The University of Nottingham’s public arts centre. It stages a year-round programme of 20th-century and contemporary art exhibitions complemented by a lively programme of public lectures, talks and participatory learning activities. In 2011 the gallery was refurbished, and the newly expanded spaces played host to a major LS Lowry exhibition that broke previous visitor records. Recent exhibitions have included: ‘In the Shadow of War’ and ‘Lee Miller’s War’ (29 November 2014 – 22 February 2015); and ‘Justin Mortimer’ and ‘Richard Hamilton. Word and Image: Prints 1963-2006’ (7 March – 31 May 2015).\nElisabeth Frink: The Presence of Sculpture Djanogly Gallery, Nottingham Lakeside Arts Notts 25 November 2015 – 28 February 2016\nRelated Posts\nThe Independent Art Voice\nArtLyst is the UK’s most popular art information website.

                "Dame Elisabeth Frink (Getty Museum)\nDame Elisabeth Frink\nNationality\nBritish\nElisabeth Frink's primary subjects are basic and familiar--men, dogs, horses, and birds. Frink reduced these forms to their essence, imbuing them both with dignity and mystery.\nFrink grew up during World War II and violence materializes in much of her work. Her father served as an army officer and her family lived near an airfield in the east of England. After the war, Frink attended Guildford School of Art followed by Chelsea School of Art. While still studying at Chelsea, she sold her sculpture Bird to London's Tate Gallery. The bird theme would occupy her over the next two decades. Her earliest birds--often menacing, predatory creatures--powerfully convey post-war fears and fascinations.\nBeginning in the late 1950s, Frink explored her interest in flight by creating sculptures of winged men and a series of figures crashing down from the sky. In 1964, she began a series of haunting soldiers' heads followed by the celebrated \"Goggle Head\" forms. These menacing male busts, their eyes concealed by sunglasses, portrayed for Frink the brutality of the Algerian war. In the late 1960s, she moved to the south of France. Wild horses in the region inspired many sculptures. On returning to England in 1973, she focused on male nudes with mask-like features and attenuated limbs.\nLike Alberto Giacometti and Henry Moore, Frink built her forms with plaster directly on a metal armature. She would often carve away from the plaster to create a more dynamic surface. The finished form could then be cast in bronze. Frink's ability to create ambitious figures that coexist with the landscape they inhabit earned her many public commissions and popular acclaim in Britain.",

                "Elizabeth Frink\nContact\nDame Elisabeth Frink (1930 - 1993)\nDame Elisabeth Frink was born in  1930 in Thurlow, Suffolk,  the daughter of Ralph, an officer in the 7th Dragoon Guards and of the renowned  Indian Army cavalry regiment, Skinner's Horse. From a very early age, Elisabeth developed a love and fascination with the outdoors. She was competent in riding  and shooting and adored dogs - all of which were, at the time, considered male  activities and attributes. It could be said that this fascination with  masculinity would become a dominant feature of her art.\nHaving begun her education at a convent in Exmouth, Frink studied at Guildford  and Chelsea  schools of art between 1947 and 1953, where Bernard Meadows and Willi Soukop  were her tutors. She herself went on to teach at Chelsea  (1953-60) and St Martin's School   of Art (1955-7).\nFrink achieved commercial success at a young age when, in 1952, Beaux Arts  Gallery in London  held her first major solo exhibition and the Tate Gallery purchased one work  entitled 'Bird'. This marked the beginning of a highly acclaimed career in  which Frink earned a reputation as one of Britain's most important post-war  sculptors.\nAs such, she was awarded Honorary Doctorates by the University  of Surrey (1977), Open University  (1983), University of Warwick (1983), University  of Cambridge (1988), University of Exeter  (1988), University of Oxford (1989) and University of Keele  (1989). In 1977 Frink was elected a member of the Royal Academy.  Her achievements also earned her a CBE (1969) and in 1982 she was created a  Dame of the British Empire.\nFrink is well known for her  monumental commissions of which there have been several. These include 'Eagle'  installed at the JFK memorial in Dallas,   Texas; 'Warhorse', on display at  Chatsworth; and 'Risen Christ', for Liverpool Cathedral.\nShe also exhibited regularly, particularly at the Waddington Galleries and was  an accomplished painter and etcher, illustrating Aesop's Fables (1967), The  Canterbury Tales (1971), and the Odyssey and Iliad (1974 - 1975).\nFrink's unique sculptural style is characterised by a rough treatment of the  surface, so that each piece is richly embedded with the artist's creative  process and personal impression. At the same time, these highly textured  surfaces project the vitality of her subject, giving Frink's sculpture an  almost abstract quality.\nMirage II, 1967\nBronze Gold Patina\nEdition 2 of 5\nIn 1963 Elisabeth Frink's first  strange predatory bird forms appeared in the cult science fiction film The  Damned. The elongated limbs and attenuated upper bodies are typical of these  and as the series developed so the artist continued to pare away and simplify  the forms until in the Mirage sculptures the bird becomes a strange, amorphous,  wingless species, powerful, aggressive, menacing. These fearsome animals, more  birdmen than birds, are anchored to the ground, they will never fly, they\nstalk, emphasised by the gangly legs  (typical of all Frink's male figures), and they attack, the jutting beak is  still recognisable. They are both threatened and threatening, and in the  awkwardness of their posture they emphasise their inadequate status, earth  bound, tethered, doomed.\n91.4 x 53 x 21.5 cms (35.92 x 20.83  Inches)\nProvenance Dover Street Arts Club  purchased from the Artist\nCopyright 2014 Arts International - Designed and built by WebsiteDynamix.co.uk",

(39.5 in.) high\nLondon, Lumley Cazalet Ltd., Elisabeth Frink, Sculpture & Drawing 1965-1993, November-December 1994, cat.no.23 (another cast)\nLITERATURE:\nEdward Lucie-Smith, Elisabeth Frink, Sculpture Since 1984 and Drawings, Art Books International, London, 1994, p.190 (another cast ill.b&w)\n'Frink's dogs are an excellent example of the way in which she managed to remain a popular, communicative artist at a time when the visual arts, sculpture in particular, were becoming increasingly esoteric.' (Edward Lucie-Smith).\nIt is true, as Edward Lucie-Smith comments, that Frink's large and imposing Leonardo's Dog II resembles the attractive Hungarian gun-dog breed of Vizslas; although the sculptor maintained they were not based on any one particular breed. The droopy ears, rounded nose and raised eyebrows lend the dog an inquisitiveness and friendliness which is also conveyed in her maquette for the present work. However, the author also notes:\n'It would have been easy to sentimentalize subject-matter of this type, and transform it into something unbearably kitsch. It says much for Frink's talent, and for her temperament  her attitude towards the natural world  that she was able to avoid this trap. Her avoidance of it is perhaps the more remarkable considering that some dogs she depicted are scarcely out of puppyhood.' (Edward Lucie-Smith, Elisabeth Frink, Sculpture Since 1984 and Drawings, Art Books International, London, 1994, p.19).\nClearly these dogs have a broad and international appeal; the 11 ½ in. high maquette simply titled Dog, sold in these rooms for a remarkable £133,250 in May of this year. Frink herself realised the commercial appeal of the subject, as the maquettes were sold to benefit the Great Ormond Street Childrens Hospital.\nAs is often the case with Frink's animal sculptures the idea for representing the dog was established early on in her career, during the formative years of the 1950s. In one particular bronze, Blind Beggar and Dog (1957) the animal is used in a protective roll, leading its helpless master forward in search of money. The dog's legs have been attenuated in much the same way as her other bronze, Dog from the same year, so that the creature takes on the appearance of something more wild, like a jackal perhaps.  Revisiting the subject 35 years later this comforting idea, of protection, had not left Frink; the title of the present work was inspired by the stone dogs which guard and protect  the entrance to the Chateau de Cloux near Amboise, Leonardo da Vinci's home when he died in 1519. Again, the dog is there to serve, ever faithful, but in this instance depicted in a far more domesticated fashion, one which is more accessible to the viewer and representative of the animal she is working from.\nIt is difficult to appreciate when looking at a photograph of Leonardo's Dog II just how solid and three-dimensional the sculpture is. There is a 'presence' and weight attached to the work which Lucie-Smith has likened to the monumentality of War Horse for Chatsworth. Only upon walking the complete way around the sculpture can the viewer engage and appreciate the power behind this alert beast. Its vaguely rendered and over-sized paws serve to fix the seated dog to its chosen location, whether indoors or outside, and the lack of modeling to the surface emphasizes the vastness of the dog.\nCreated in the penultimate year of her life, Leonardo's Dog II is a fitting tribute to Frink's love affair with all types of animals over a four decade long career.\nActivities\nGo to Modern British and Irish Art\nAuction information\nBonhams' November sale achieved a number of high profile records, including the highest price in London that week within a sale of Modern British Art - Allies by Lawrence Holofcener fetched an impressive £409,250.

                "Rudolf Walter Richard Heß, also spelled Hess (26 April 1894 – 17 August 1987), was a prominent politician in Nazi Germany. Appointed Deputy Führer to Adolf Hitler in 1933, he served in this position until 1941, when he flew solo to Scotland in an attempt to negotiate peace with the United Kingdom during World War II. He was taken prisoner and eventually was convicted of crimes against peace, serving a life sentence.\n\nHess enlisted in the 7th Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment as an infantryman at the outbreak of World War I. He was wounded several times over the course of the war, and won the Iron Cross, 2nd class, in 1915. Shortly before the war ended, Hess enrolled to train as an aviator, but he saw no action in this role. He left the armed forces in December 1918 with the rank of Leutnant der Reserve.\n\nIn 1919, Hess enrolled in the University of Munich, where he studied geopolitics under Karl Haushofer, a proponent of the concept of Lebensraum (\"living space\"), which later became one of the pillars of Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP) ideology. Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July 1920, and was at Hitler's side on 8 November 1923 for the Beer Hall Putsch, a failed Nazi attempt to seize control of the government of Bavaria. Whilst serving time in jail for this attempted coup, Hess helped Hitler write his book, Mein Kampf, which became a foundation of the political platform of the NSDAP.\n\nAfter the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Hess was appointed Deputy Führer of the NSDAP and received a post in Hitler's cabinet. He was the third most powerful man in Germany, behind only Hitler and Hermann Göring. In addition to appearing on Hitler's behalf at speaking engagements and rallies, Hess signed into law much of the legislation, including the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, which stripped the Jews of Germany of their rights in the lead-up to the Holocaust.\n\nHess continued to be interested in aviation, learning to fly the more advanced aircraft that were coming into development at the start of World War II. On 10 May 1941 he undertook a solo flight to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody until the end of the war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war criminals in 1946. Throughout much of the trial, he claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted of crimes against peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served a life sentence. Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win him early release were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.\n\nEarly life\n\nHess, the oldest of three children, was born on 26 April 1894 in Alexandria, Egypt, into the ethnic German family of Fritz Hess, a prosperous merchant from Bavaria, and Clara Hess (née Münch). His brother, Alfred, was born in 1897 and his sister, Margarete, was born in 1908. The family lived in a villa on the Egyptian coast near Alexandria, and visited Germany often from 1900, staying at their summer home in Reicholdsgrün (now part of Kirchenlamitz) in the Fichtel Mountains. Hess attended a German language Protestant school in Alexandria from 1900 to 1908, when he was sent back to Germany to study at a boarding school in Bad Godesberg. He demonstrated an aptitude for science and mathematics, but his father wished him to join the family business, Hess & Co., so he sent him in 1911 to study at the École supérieure de commerce in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. After a year there, Hess took an apprenticeship at a trading company in Hamburg.\n\nWorld War I\n\nWithin weeks of the outbreak of World War I, Hess enlisted in the 7th Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment. His initial posting was against the British on the Somme; he was present at the First Battle of Ypres. On 9 November 1914 Hess transferred to the 1st Infantry Regiment, stationed near Arras. He was awarded the Iron Cross, second class, and promoted to Gefreiter (corporal) in April 1915. After additional training at the Munster Training Area, he was promoted to Vizefeldwebel (senior non-commissioned officer) and received the Bavarian Military Merit Cross. Returning to the front lines in November, he fought in Artois, participating in the battle for the town of Neuville-Saint-Vaast. After two months out of action with a throat infection, Hess served in the Battle of Verdun in May, and was hit by shrapnel in the left hand and arm on 12 June 1916 in fighting near the village of Thiaumont. After a month off to recover, he was sent back to the Verdun area, where he remained until December.\n\nHess was promoted to platoon leader of the 10th Company of the 18th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment, which was serving in Romania. He was wounded on 23 July and again on 8 August 1917; the first injury was a shell splinter to the left arm, which was dressed in the field, but the second was a bullet wound that entered the upper chest near the armpit and exited near his spinal column, leaving a pea-sized entry wound and a cherry stone-sized exit wound on his back. By 20 August he was well enough to travel, so he was sent to hospital in Hungary and eventually back to Germany, where he recovered in hospital in Meissen. In October he received promotion to Leutnant der Reserve and was recommended for, but did not receive, the Iron Cross, first class. At his father's request, Hess was transferred to a hospital closer to home, arriving at Alexandersbad on 25 October.\n\nWhile still convalescing, Hess had requested that he be allowed to enrol to train as a pilot, so after some Christmas leave with his family he reported to Munich, where he passed the required tests and underwent aeronautical training. By 14 October he had been assigned to Jagdstaffel 35b, a Bavarian fighter squadron equipped with Fokker D.VII biplanes. He saw no action with Jagdstaffel 35b, as the war ended on 11 November 1918, before he had the opportunity.\n\nHess was discharged from the armed forces in December 1918. The family fortunes had taken a serious downturn, as their business interests in Egypt had been expropriated by the British. Hess joined the Thule Society, an antisemitic right-wing Völkisch group, and a Freikorps, one of many such volunteer paramilitary organisations active in Germany at the time. Bavaria witnessed frequent and often bloody conflicts between right-wing groups such as the Freikorps and left-wing forces as they fought for control of the state during this period. Hess was a participant in street battles in the spring of 1919 and led a group which distributed thousands of antisemitic pamphlets in Munich.\n\nIn 1919 Hess enrolled in the University of Munich, where he studied history and economics. His geopolitics professor was Karl Haushofer, a proponent of the concept of Lebensraum (\"living space\"), which Haushofer cited to justify the proposal that Germany should forcefully conquer additional territory in Eastern Europe. Hess later introduced this concept to Adolf Hitler, and it became one of the pillars of Nazi Party ideology. Hess became friends with Haushofer and his son Albrecht, a social theorist and lecturer.\n\nIlse Pröhl, a fellow student at the university, met Hess in April 1920 when they by chance rented rooms in the same boarding house. They married on 20 December 1927 and their son Wolf Rüdiger Hess was born ten years later, in 1937.\n\nRelationship with Hitler\n\nAfter hearing NSDAP leader Hitler speak for the first time in 1920 at a Munich rally, Hess became completely devoted to him. They held a shared belief in the stab-in-the-back myth, the notion that Germany's loss in World War I was caused by a conspiracy of Jews and Bolsheviks rather than a military defeat. Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July as member number 16. As the party continued to grow, holding rallies and meetings in ever larger beer halls in Munich, he focused his attention on fundraising and organisational activities. On 4 November 1921 he was injured while protecting Hitler when a bomb planted by a Marxist group exploded at the Hofbräuhaus during a party event. Hess joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) by 1922 and helped organise and recruit its early membership.\n\nMeanwhile, problems continued with the economy; hyperinflation caused personal fortunes to be rendered worthless. When the German government failed to meet their reparations payments and French troops marched in to occupy the industrial areas along the Ruhr in January 1923, widespread civil unrest was the result. Hitler decided the time was ripe to attempt to seize control of the government with a coup d'état modelled on Benito Mussolini's 1922 March on Rome. Hess was with Hitler on the night of 8 November 1923 when he and the SA stormed a public meeting organised by Bavaria's de facto ruler, Staatskommissar (state commissioner) Gustav von Kahr, in the Bürgerbräukeller, a large beer hall in Munich. Brandishing a pistol, Hitler interrupted Kahr's speech and announced that the national revolution had begun, declaring the formation of a new government with World War I General Erich Ludendorff. The next day, Hitler and several thousand supporters attempted to march to the Ministry of War in the city centre. Gunfire broke out between the Nazis and the police; fourteen marchers and four police officers were killed. Hitler was arrested on 11 November.\n\nHess and some SA men had taken a few of the dignitaries hostage on the night of the 8th, driving them to a house about 50 km from Munich. When Hess left briefly to make a phone call the next day, the hostages convinced the driver to help them escape. Hess, stranded, called Ilse Pröhl, who brought him a bicycle so he could return to Munich. He went to stay with the Haushofers and then fled to Austria, but they convinced him to return. He was arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in the attempted coup, which later became known as the Beer Hall Putsch. Hitler was sentenced to five years imprisonment, and the NSDAP and SA were both outlawed.\n\nBoth men were incarcerated in Landsberg Prison, where Hitler soon began work on his memoir, Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\"), which he dictated to fellow prisoners Hess and Emil Maurice. Edited by publisher Max Amann, Hess and others, the work was published in two parts in 1925 and 1926. It was later released in a single volume, which became a best-seller after 1930. This book, with its message of violent antisemitism, became the foundation of the political platform of the NSDAP.\n\nHitler was released on parole on 20 December 1924 and Hess ten days later. The ban on the NSDAP and SA was lifted in February 1925, and the party grew to 100,000 members in 1928 and 150,000 in 1929. They received only 2.6 per cent of the vote in the 1928 election, but support increased steadily up until the seizure of power in 1933.\n\nHitler named Hess his private secretary in April 1925 at a salary of 500 Reichsmarks per month, and named him as personal adjutant on 20 July 1929. Hess accompanied Hitler to speaking engagements around the country and became his friend and confidante. In December 1932 Hess was named party Political Central Commissioner.\n\nRetaining his interest in flying after the end of his active military career, Hess obtained his private pilot's licence on 4 April 1929. His instructor was World War I flying ace Theodor Croneiss. In 1930 Hess became the owner of a BFW M.23b monoplane sponsored by the party newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter. He acquired two more Messerschmitt aircraft in the early 1930s, logging many flying hours and becoming proficient in the operation of light single-engine aircraft.\n\nDeputy Führer\n\nOn 30 January 1933 Hitler was appointed Reich Chancellor, his first step in gaining dictatorial control of Germany. Hess was named Deputy Führer of the NSDAP on 21 April and was appointed to the cabinet, with the post of Reich Minister without Portfolio, on 1 December.  With offices in the Brown House in Munich and another in Berlin, Hess was responsible for several departments, including foreign affairs, finance, health, education and law. All legislation passed through his office for approval, except that concerning the army, the police and foreign policy, and he wrote and co-signed many of Hitler's decrees. An organiser of the annual Nuremberg Rallies, he usually gave the opening speech and introduced Hitler. Hess also spoke over the radio and at rallies around the country, so frequently that the speeches were collected into book form in 1938. Hess acted as Hitler's delegate in negotiations with industrialists and members of the wealthier classes. As Hess had been born abroad, Hitler had him oversee the NSDAP groups such as the NSDAP/AO that were in charge of party members living in other countries. Hitler instructed Hess to review all court decisions that related to persons deemed enemies of the Party. He was authorised to increase the sentences of anyone he felt got off too lightly in these cases, and was also empowered to take \"merciless action\" if he saw fit to do so. This often entailed sending the person to a concentration camp or simply ordering the person killed. Hess was given the rank of Obergruppenführer in the Schutzstaffel (SS) in 1934, the second-highest SS rank.\n\nThe Nazi regime began to persecute Jews soon after the seizure of power. Hess's office was partly responsible for drafting Hitler's Nuremberg Laws of 1935, laws that had far-reaching implications for the Jews of Germany, banning marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and depriving non-Aryans of their German citizenship. Hess's friend Karl Haushofer and his family were subject to these laws, as Haushofer had married a half-Jewish woman, so Hess issued documents exempting them from this legislation.\n\nHess did not build a power base or develop a coterie of followers. He was motivated by his loyalty to Hitler and a desire to be useful to him; he did not seek power or prestige or take advantage of his position to accumulate personal wealth. He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland and the start of World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.\n\nHess was obsessed with his health to the point of hypochondria, consulting many doctors and other practitioners for what he described to his captors in Britain as a long list of ailments involving the kidneys, colon, gall bladder, bowels and heart. Like Hitler, Hess was a vegetarian, and he did not smoke or drink. He brought his own food to the Berghof, claiming it was biologically dynamic, but Hitler did not approve of this practice, so he discontinued taking meals with the Führer.\n\nHess was interested in music, enjoyed reading and loved to spend time hiking and climbing in the mountains with Ilse. He and his friend Albrecht Haushofer shared an interest in astrology, and Hess also was keen on clairvoyance and the occult. Hess continued to be interested in aviation. He won an air race in 1934, flying a BFW M.35 in a circuit around Zugspitze Mountain and returning to the airfield at Munich with a time of 29 minutes. He placed sixth of 29 participants in a similar race held the following year. With the outbreak of World War II, Hess asked Hitler to be allowed to join the Luftwaffe as a pilot, but Hitler forbade it, and ordered him to stop flying for the duration of the war. Hess convinced him to reduce the ban to one year.\n\nAttempted peace mission\n\nAs the war progressed, Hitler's attention became focused on foreign affairs and the conduct of the war, to the exclusion of all else. Hess, not directly engaged in either of these endeavours, though he felt qualified to do so, became increasingly sidelined from the affairs of the nation and from Hitler's attention; Bormann had successfully supplanted Hess in many of his duties and usurped his position at Hitler's side. Also concerned that Germany would face a war on two fronts as plans progressed for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union scheduled to take place in spring 1941, Hess decided to boldly attempt to bring Britain to the negotiating table by travelling there himself to seek meetings with the British government. He asked the advice of Albrecht Haushofer, who suggested several potential contacts in Britain. Hess settled on fellow aviator Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton, whom he had never met. On Hess's instructions, Haushofer wrote to Hamilton in September 1940, but the letter was intercepted by MI5 and Hamilton did not see it until March 1941. Hamilton was chosen in the mistaken belief that he was one of the leaders of an opposition party opposed to war with Germany, and because he was a friend of Haushofer.\n\nA letter Hess wrote to his wife dated 4 November 1940 shows that in spite of not receiving a reply from Hamilton, he intended to proceed with his plan. He began training on the Messerschmitt Bf 110, a two-seater twin-engine aircraft, in October 1940 under instructor Wilhelm Stör, the chief test pilot at Messerschmitt. He continued to practice, including logging many cross-country flights, and found a specific aircraft that handled well—a Bf 110E-1/N—which was from then on held in reserve for his personal use. He asked for a radio compass, modifications to the oxygen delivery system, and large long-range fuel tanks to be installed on this plane, and these requests were granted by March 1941.\n\nAfter a final check of the weather reports for Germany and the North Sea, Hess took off at 17:45 on 10 May 1941 from the airfield at Augsburg-Haunstetten in his specially prepared aircraft. It was the last of several attempts to depart on his mission; previous efforts had to be called off due to mechanical problems or poor weather. Wearing a leather flying suit bearing the rank of captain, he brought along a supply of money and toiletries, a torch, a camera, maps and charts, and a collection of 28 different medicines, as well as dextrose tablets to help ward off fatigue and an assortment of homeopathic remedies.\n\nFlight to Scotland\n\nInitially setting a course towards Bonn, Hess used landmarks on the ground to orient himself and make minor course corrections. When he reached the coast near the Frisian Islands, he turned and flew in an easterly direction for some twenty minutes to stay out of range of British radar. He then took a heading of 335 degrees for the trip across the North Sea, initially at low altitude, but travelling for most of the journey at 5000 ft. At 20:58 he changed his heading to 245 degrees, intending to approach the coast of North East England near the town of Bamburgh, Northumberland. As it was not yet sunset when he initially approached the coast, Hess backtracked, zigzagging back and forth for some 40 minutes until it grew dark. Around this time his auxiliary fuel tanks were exhausted, so he released them into the sea. Also around this time, at 22:08, the British Chain Home station at Ottercops Moss near Newcastle upon Tyne detected his presence and passed along this information to the Filter Room at Bentley Priory. Soon he had been detected by several other stations, and the aircraft was designated as \"Raid 42\".\n\nTwo Spitfires of No. 72 Squadron RAF, No. 13 Group RAF that were already in the air were sent to attempt an interception, but failed to find the intruder. A third Spitfire sent from Acklington at 22:20 also failed to spot the aircraft; by then it was dark and Hess had dropped to an extremely low altitude, so low that the volunteer on duty at the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) station at Chatton was able to correctly identify it as a Bf 110, and reported its altitude as 50 ft. Tracked by additional ROC posts, Hess continued his flight into Scotland at high speed and low altitude, but was unable to spot his destination, Dungavel House, so he headed for the west coast to orient himself and then turned back inland. At 22:35 a Boulton Paul Defiant sent from No. 141 Squadron RAF based at Ayr began pursuit. Hess was nearly out of fuel, so he climbed to 6000 ft and parachuted out of the plane at 23:06. He injured his foot, either while exiting the aircraft or when he hit the ground. The aircraft crashed at 23:09, about 12 mi west of Dungavel House. He would have been closer to his destination had he not had trouble exiting the aircraft. Hess considered this achievement to be the proudest moment of his life.\n\nBefore his departure from Germany, Hess had given his adjutant, Karlheinz Pintsch, a letter addressed to Hitler that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British. Pintsch delivered the letter to Hitler at the Berghof around noon on 11 May. Albert Speer later said Hitler described Hess's departure as one of the worst personal blows of his life, as he considered it a personal betrayal. Hitler worried that his allies, Italy and Japan, would perceive Hess's act as an attempt by Hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the British. For this reason, Hitler ordered that the German press should characterise Hess as a madman who made the decision to fly to Scotland entirely on his own, without Hitler's knowledge or authority. Some members of the government, including Göring and Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, believed this only made matters worse, because if Hess truly were mentally ill, he should not have been holding an important government position. Hitler stripped Hess of all of his party and state offices, and secretly ordered him shot on sight if he ever returned to Germany.  He abolished the post of Deputy Führer, assigning Hess's former duties to Bormann, with the title of Head of the Party Chancellery. Hitler initiated Aktion Hess, a flurry of hundreds of arrests of astrologers, faith healers and occultists that took place around 9 June. The campaign was part of a propaganda effort by Goebbels and others to denigrate Hess and to make scapegoats of occult practitioners.\n\nAmerican journalist H. R. Knickerbocker, who had met both Hitler and Hess, speculated that Hitler had sent Hess to deliver a message informing Winston Churchill of the forthcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, and offering a negotiated peace or even an anti-Bolshevik partnership. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin believed that Hess's flight had been engineered by the British. Stalin persisted in this belief as late as 1944, when he mentioned the matter to Churchill, who insisted that they had no advance knowledge of the flight.\n\nPeter Padfield's Hess, Hitler and Churchill (2013) explores the mystery of Hess's flight to Britain. Padfield suggests that Hess was carrying documents with detailed proposals from Hitler which would have meant peace between Germany and Britain, which would stand neutral in a planned German war against the Soviet Union, in return for which Germany was willing to withdraw from Western Europe.\n\nCapture\n\nHess landed at Floors Farm, Eaglesham, south of Glasgow, where he was discovered still struggling with his parachute by local ploughman David McLean. Identifying himself as \"Hauptmann Alfred Horn\", Hess said he had an important message for the Duke of Hamilton. McLean helped Hess to his nearby cottage and contacted the local Home Guard unit, who escorted the captive to their headquarters in Busby, East Renfrewshire. He was next taken to the police station at Giffnock, arriving sometime after midnight; he was searched and his possessions confiscated. Hess repeatedly requested to meet with the Duke of Hamilton during questioning undertaken with the aid of an interpreter by Major Graham Donald, the area commandant of Royal Observer Corps. After the interview Hess was taken under guard to Maryhill Barracks in Glasgow, where his injuries were treated. By this time some of his captors suspected Hess's true identity, though he continued to insist his name was Horn.\n\nHamilton had been on duty as Wing Commander at RAF Turnhouse near Edinburgh when Hess had arrived, and his station had been one of those that had tracked the progress of the flight. He arrived at Maryhill Barracks the next morning, and after examining Hess's effects, he met alone with the prisoner. Hess immediately admitted his true identity and outlined the reason for his flight. Hamilton told Hess that he hoped to continue the conversation with the aid of an interpreter; Hess could speak English well, but was having trouble understanding Hamilton. After the meeting, Hamilton examined the remains of the Messerschmitt in the company of an intelligence officer, then returned to Turnhouse, where he made arrangements through the Foreign Office to meet Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who was at Ditchley for the weekend. They had some preliminary talks that night, and Hamilton accompanied Churchill back to London the next day, where they both met with members of the War Cabinet. Churchill sent Hamilton with foreign affairs expert Ivone Kirkpatrick, who had met Hess previously, to positively identify the prisoner, who had been moved to Buchanan Castle overnight. Hess, who had prepared extensive notes to use during this meeting, spoke to them at length about Hitler's expansionary plans and the need for Britain to let the Nazis have free rein in Europe, in exchange for being allowed to keep its overseas possessions. Kirkpatrick held two more meetings with Hess over the course of the next few days, while Hamilton returned to his duties. Hess, in addition to being disappointed at the apparent failure of his mission, began claiming that his medical treatment was inadequate and that there was a plot afoot to poison him.\n\nHess's flight, but not his destination or fate, was first announced by Munich Radio in Germany on the evening of 12 May. On 13 May Hitler sent Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to give the news in person to Mussolini, and the British press was permitted to release full information about events that same day. On 14 May Ilse Hess finally learned that her husband had survived the trip when news of his fate was broadcast on German radio.\n\nThe wreckage of the aircraft was salvaged by 63 Maintenance Unit between 11 and 16 May 1941 and was taken to Oxford to be stored. The aeroplane was armed with four machine guns in the nose but carried no ammunition. Several pieces of the plane are still extant, including the two engines, one of which is at the Royal Air Force Museum London. The other engine and a piece of the fuselage are at the Imperial War Museum in London.\n\nTrial and imprisonment\n\nPrisoner of war\n\nFrom Buchanan Castle, Hess was transferred briefly to the Tower of London and then to Mytchett Place in Surrey, a fortified mansion, designated \"Camp Z\", where he stayed for the next thirteen months. Churchill issued orders that Hess was to be treated well, though he was not allowed to read newspapers or listen to the radio. Three intelligence officers were stationed onsite and 150 soldiers were placed on guard. By early June, Hess was allowed to write to his family. He also prepared a letter to the Duke of Hamilton, but it was never delivered, and his repeated requests for further meetings were turned down. Major Frank Foley, the leading German expert in MI6 and former British Passport Control Officer in Berlin, took charge of a year-long abortive debriefing of Hess, according to Foreign Office files released to the National Archives. Dr Henry V. Dicks and Dr John Rawlings Rees, psychiatrists who treated Hess during this period, note that while he was not insane, he was mentally unstable, with tendencies toward hypochondria and paranoia. Hess repeated his peace proposal to John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon, then serving as Lord Chancellor, in an interview on 9 June. Lord Simon noted that the prisoner's mental state was not good; Hess claimed he was being poisoned and was being prevented from sleeping. He would insist on swapping his dinner with that of one of his guards, and attempted to get them to send samples of the food out for analysis.\n\nIn the early morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and attempted suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for twelve weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nHess was moved to Maindiff Court Hospital on 26 June 1942, where he would remain for the next three years. The facility was chosen for its added security and the need for fewer guards. Hess was allowed walks on the grounds and car trips into the surrounding countryside. He had access to newspapers and other reading materials; he wrote letters and journals. His mental health remained under the care of Dr Rees. Hess continued to complain on and off of memory loss and made a second suicide attempt on 4 February 1945, when he stabbed himself with a bread knife. The wound was not serious, requiring two stitches. Despondent that Germany was losing the war, he took no food for the next week, only resuming eating when he was threatened with being force-fed.\n\nGermany surrendered unconditionally on 8 May 1945. Hess, facing charges as a war criminal, was ordered to appear before the International Military Tribunal and was transported to Nuremberg on 10 October 1945.\n\nNuremberg Trials\n\nThe Allies of World War II held a series of military tribunals and trials, beginning with a trial of the major war criminals from November 1945 to October 1946. Hess was tried with this first group of twenty-three defendants, all of whom were charged with four counts—conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity, in violation of international laws governing warfare.\n\nOn his arrival in Nuremberg, Hess was reluctant to give up some of his possessions, including samples of food he claimed had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use these for his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised him that he would be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing 65 kg, and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to be in good health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he was out of his cell.\n\nAlmost immediately after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, which may have been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. He spoke to the tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.\n\nThe prosecution's case against Hess was presented by Mervyn Griffith-Jones beginning on 7 February 1946. By quoting from Hess's speeches, he attempted to demonstrate that Hess had been aware of and agreed with Hitler's plans to conduct a war of aggression in violation of international law. He declared that as Hess had signed important governmental decrees, including the decree requiring mandatory military service, the Nuremberg racial laws, and a decree incorporating the conquered Polish territories into the Reich, he must share responsibility for the acts of the regime. He pointed out that the timing of Hess's trip to Scotland, only six weeks before the German invasion of the Soviet Union, could only be viewed as an attempt by Hess to keep the British out of the war. Hess resumed showing symptoms of amnesia at the end of February, partway through the prosecution's case.\n\nThe case for Hess's defence was presented from 22–26 March by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl. He noted that while Hess accepted responsibility for the many decrees he had signed, he said these matters were part of the internal workings of a sovereign state and thus outside the purview of a war crimes trial. He called to the stand Ernst Wilhelm Bohle, the man who had been head of the NSDAP/AO, to testify on Hess's behalf. When presented by Griffith-Jones with questions about the organisation's spying in several countries, Bohle testified that any warlike activities such as espionage had been done without his permission or knowledge. Seidl called two other witnesses, former mayor of Stuttgart Karl Strölin and Hess's brother Alfred, both of whom refuted the allegations that the NSDAP/AO had been spying and fomenting war. Seidl presented a summation of the defence's case on 25 July, in which he attempted to refute the charge of conspiracy by pointing out that Hitler alone had made all the important decisions. He noted that Hess could not be held responsible for any events that took place after he left Germany in May 1941. Meanwhile, Hess mentally detached himself from what was happening, declining visits from his family and refusing to read the newspapers.\n\nThe court deliberated for nearly two months before passing judgement on 30 September, with the defendants being individually sentenced on 1 October. Hess was found guilty on two counts: crimes against peace (planning and preparing a war of aggression), and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes. He was found not guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was given a life sentence, one of seven Nazis to receive prison sentences at the trial. These seven were transported by aircraft to the Allied military prison at Spandau in Berlin on 18 July 1947. The Soviet member of the tribunal, Major-General Iona Nikitchenko, filed a document recording his dissent of Hess's sentence; he felt the death sentence was warranted.\n\nSpandau Prison\n\nSpandau was placed under the control of the Allied Control Council, the governing body in charge of the military occupation of Germany. It consisted of representatives from four member states: Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union. Each country supplied guards for the prison for a month at a time on a rotating basis. After the inmates were given medical examinations—Hess refused his body search, and had to be held down—they were provided with prison garb and assigned the numbers by which they would be addressed throughout their stay. Hess was Number 7. The prison had a small library, and inmates were allowed to file special requests for additional reading material. Writing materials were limited; each inmate would be allowed four pieces of paper per month for letters. The prisoners were not allowed to speak to one another without permission and were expected to work in the facility, helping with cleaning and gardening chores. The inmates were taken for outdoor walks around the prison grounds for an hour each day, separated about 10 yd apart. Some of the rules became more relaxed as time went on.\n\nVisits to Spandau of half an hour per month were allowed, but Hess forbade his family to visit until December 1969, when he was a patient at the British Military Hospital in West Berlin for a perforated ulcer. By this time Wolf Rüdiger Hess was 32 years old and Ilse 69; they had not seen Hess since his departure from Germany in 1941. After this illness, he allowed his family to visit regularly. His daughter-in-law Andrea, who often brought photos and films of his grandchildren, became a particularly welcome visitor. Hess's health problems, both mental and physical, were ongoing during his captivity. He cried out in the night, claiming he had stomach pains. He continued to suspect that his food was being poisoned and complained of amnesia. A psychiatrist who examined him in 1957 deemed he was not ill enough to be transferred to a mental hospital. Another unsuccessful suicide attempt took place in 1977.\n\nOther than his stays in hospital, Hess spent the rest of his life in Spandau Prison. His fellow inmates Konstantin von Neurath, Walther Funk and Erich Raeder were released because of poor health in the 1950s; Karl Dönitz, Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer served their time and were released, Dönitz in 1956, Schirach and Speer in 1966. The 600-cell prison continued to be maintained for its lone prisoner from Speer and Schirach's release until Hess's death in 1987, at an estimated cost of DM 800,000. Conditions were far more pleasant in the 1980s than in the early years; Hess was allowed to move more freely around the cell block, setting his own routine and choosing his own activities, which included television, films, reading and gardening. A lift was installed so he could more readily access the garden, and he was provided with a medical orderly from 1982 onward.\n\nNumerous appeals for Hess's release were launched by his lawyer, Dr Seidl, beginning as early as 1947. These were denied, mainly because the Soviets repeatedly vetoed the proposal. Spandau was located in West Berlin, and its existence gave the Soviets a foothold in that sector of the city. Additionally, Soviet officials believed Hess must have known in 1941 that an attack on their country was imminent. In 1967 Wolf Rüdiger Hess began a campaign to win his father's release, garnering support from notable politicians such as Geoffrey Lawrence, 1st Baron Oaksey in Britain and Willy Brandt in Germany, but to no avail, in spite of the prisoner's advanced age and deteriorating health.\n\nDeath and aftermath\n\nHess died on 17 August 1987 at the age of 93 in a summer house that had been set up in the prison garden as a reading room. He took an extension cord from one of the lamps, strung it over a window latch, and hanged himself. Death occurred by asphyxiation. A short note to his family, thanking them for all they had done, was found in his pocket. The Four Powers released a statement on 17 September ruling the death a suicide. Initially buried at a secret location to avoid media attention or demonstrations by Nazi sympathisers, Hess was re-interred in a family plot at Wunsiedel on 17 March 1988, and his wife was buried beside him when she died in 1995. Spandau Prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.\n\nHis lawyer, Dr Seidl, felt Hess was too old and frail to have managed to kill himself. Wolf Rüdiger Hess repeatedly claimed that his father had been murdered by the British Secret Intelligence Service to prevent him from revealing information about British misconduct during the war. Abdallah Melaouhi, who served as Hess's medical orderly from 1982 to 1987, was dismissed from his position at his local district parliament's Immigration and Integration Advisory Council after he wrote a self-published book on a similar theme. According to an investigation by the British government in 1989, the available evidence did not back up the claim that Hess was murdered, and Solicitor General Sir Nicholas Lyell saw no grounds for further investigation. Moreover, the autopsy results support the conclusion that Hess had killed himself. A report released in 2012 again raised the question of whether Hess was murdered. Historian Peter Padfield claims the suicide note found on the body appears to have been written when Hess was hospitalised in 1969.\n\nAfter the town of Wunsiedel became the scene of pilgrimages and neo-Nazi demonstrations every August on the date of Hess's death, the parish council decided not to allow an extension on the grave site's lease when it expired in 2011. With the consent of his family, Hess's grave was re-opened on 20 July 2011 and his remains were exhumed, and then cremated. His ashes were scattered at sea by family members; the gravestone, which bore the epitaph \"Ich hab's gewagt\" (\"I have dared\"), was destroyed."

And 1 fact per week is the only e-mail you'll get unless, of course, there's something else you want to know.\nThe bizarre arrival of Rudolf Hess by parachute near Glasgow on the night of 10 May 1941 has given rise to more outlandish myths and legends than any other single event during the Second World War. Since 1946, more than twenty books dealing with the Deputy Fuhrer's mysterious 'peace mission' have appeared in print, spawning a thriving worldwide Hess conspiracy industry to rival those surrounding Jack the Ripper and the Kennedy assassination. Among the many contentious issues are whether Hitler approved of the ill-starred plan, whether Hess was expected by a well-connected peace lobby in Britain, or else lured to Britain as part of an elaborate intelligence sting, whether the Allies replaced Hess with a double, and whether he was murdered at Spandau Prison in 1987, or died by his own hand. Although few if any of these questions are likely to be resolved to the satisfaction of every Hess investigator, some of the more outlandish theories can today be safely dismissed.\nRudolf Hess\nThe established facts of the Hess affair run as follows. At 5.45 pm on  Saturday 10 May Hess, a pilot for more than twenty years, took off from the Messerschmitt works airfield at Augsburg, Bavaria, in a twin-engined Bf 110 fighter-bomber. After a journey of almost 1,000 miles lasting four hours, Hess crossed the British coast over Ainwick in Northumberland, then flew on towards his objective, Dungavel House, eventually baling out at 11 pm to land near the village of Eaglesham. Detained by the local Home Guard, Hess gave his name as 'Alfred Horn' and asked to see the Duke of Hamilton, then a serving RAF officer. After being transferred into army custody Hess was unmasked, and explained to various interrogators that the purpose of his flying visit was to seek peace between Britain and Germany. In this he failed magnificently: Hitler quickly issued a statement which alleged that Hess was mentally disordered and 'a victim of hallucinations', while Hess was detained in Britain as a prisoner of state until his conviction for conspiracy and crimes against peace at Nuremberg in 1946. Thereafter Hess was held as a Prisoner No. 7 at Spandau Prison in Berlin, always denied parole, and died on 17 August 1987 at the age of ninety-three.\nMyth and falsehood surround his epic flight even before Hess set foot on British soil. In his controversial account The Murder of Rudolf Hess (1979), Dr Hugh Thomas reproduced a series of photographs said to record Hess departing from Augsburg on 10 May. The Bf 110 shown was not equipped with long range drop-tanks, leading Thomas (and others) to surmise that the aircraft lacked sufficient fuel to reach Glasgow, and would therefore have had to land to refuel en route, or that two aircraft were involved. According to Thomas, Hess was shot down by the Luftwaffe, and replaced by a double for the flight to Scotland. However these various suppositions are based on careless research. Hess flew to Scotland in a Bf 110E, which with drop-tanks boasted a more than adequate range of 1,560 miles, and which bore the works number 3869 and the radio code VJ+OQ. The machine shown in the photographs carries the works number 3526, while Thomas managed to misquote the radio code as NJ+OQ. Although reports that a drop-tank was later recovered from the Clyde have never been verified, the simple fact is that the photographs were taken on one of the twenty-odd training flights Hess made from Augsburg before 10 May, using a completely different machine.\nMap\nSome accounts offer that Hess must have landed and refuelled at an intermediate airfield such as Schiphol or Aalborg, but this would not have been necessary. Nor is it true that Hess flew from Calais, as reported from Sweden in 1943, or that for part of his flight Hess was escorted by no less a dignitary than the future SS Reichsprotektor of Bohemia, Reinhard Heydrich, in a Bf 109 fighter. A postwar claim by the Luftwaffe fighter ace Adolf Galland should also be treated with caution. In his memoir The First and the Last (1955), Galland claimed that 'early in the evening' of 10 May he received an agitated call from Goring, ordering his entire group into the air to bring down the Deputy Fuhrer. A dubious Galland responded by sending up a token force. However, the claim is only credible if Goring and others had advance knowledge of the Hess flight, and opposed it, which raises the question of why Hess was allowed to take off from Augsburg in the first place. In the same vein, some have claimed that it would not have been possible for Hess to have flown over German territory without prior authorisation, but this is convincingly countered by Roy Nesbit and Georges Van Acker in their book The Flight of Rudolf Hess (1999). Suggestions by Richard Deacon that the Bf 110 flown by Hess was fitted with American parts are plainly nonsensical.\nThe account given by Hess of his route to Scotland is also suspect. Hess was said to have been very proud of his achievement in flying from Augsburg to Eaglesham, a distance of almost 1,000 miles, the last 400 over water and enemy territory. On a map drawn by Hess on 8 August 1941 (click here to see enlarged map), while a prisoner, he claimed to have flown north-west from Augsburg to Den Helder in Holland, then north-east for 70 miles, and then north-west again to a point above the middle of the North Sea. Here, at 8.52 pm, he made another 90 degree turn to port in order to approach the British coastline from the east. Hess claimed he then realised he had an hour to kill, since at this more northerly latitude the sun set later than in southern Germany, whereas he wished to fly overland at   dusk, and as a result executed several complicated zig-zag manoeuvres to kill time. But as Picknett, Prince and Prior argued in their highly detailed study Double Standards (2001), there is good reason to doubt this account. When Hess left Augsburg he was observed heading north, not north-west, while a part of his later zig-zag manoeuvres were carried out within range of British Chain Home radar, who instead recorded Hess (designated Raid 42J) as flying straight in from the east. Hess, at bottom an amateur pilot, claimed to have been navigating alone, which makes it highly unlikely that he could have followed such a complicated course over open water, yet still managed to land just eleven miles from his intended destination, Dungavel House. Given that Hess had been considering his mission since at least September 1940, and may have made several previous abortive attempts, it is unlikely he would have overlooked the fact that dusk fell later in the north. Instead, the authors of Double Standards guess that Hess made use of a then-secret German radio-navigational system, broadcast from the station at Kalundborg on the west coast of Zeeland in Denmark. Kalundborg lies precisely due north of Augsburg, and due east of Alnwick and Dungavel House, thus making Hess's journey far more simple, but 250 miles - and one tell-tale hour - longer.\nRudolf Hess\nIt is abundantly clear from the timing of his flight that the Hess mission was closely linked to the impending German invasion of the Soviet Union, which was launched just six weeks later, on 22 June 1941. This much was confirmed by Lord Beaverbrook on several occasions after the war. The conquest of Russia by Germany, never viable under any circumstances, would certainly be made harder by fighting a war on two fronts. The Russian factor would also explain why Hitler might deny all knowledge of the mission if it failed, assuming he was privy to the plan from the outset. Had Stalin discovered that Germany wished to make peace with Britain, he would have deduced immediately that an attack on Russia was close at hand. Instead, Germany sought to lull her notional Soviet ally into a false sense of security by continuing to threaten Operation Sealion, the seaborne invasion of Britain. Furthermore Hitler might not have wanted his Axis partners, chiefly Mussolini, to think that he was negotiating behind their backs. While this hypothesis does nothing to prove Hitler knew and approved of the Hess peace mission, it does show that he would hardly have admitted so even if he did.\nOn being informed of the Hess flight, Hitler is reported by some (including Albert Speer) to have flown into a paroxysm of rage, although other accounts (Hess adjutant Karl-Heinz Pintsch) relate that he received the news calmly. Some are of the opinion that what followed was part of a German strategy of plausible denial. Surprisingly, the first public announcement about the affair came not from London but Berlin, in the form of a radio bulletin broadcast on 12 May at 8 pm:\nA letter which he left behind unfortunately shows by its distractedness traces of a mental disorder, and it is feared he was a victim of hallucinations. The Fuhrer at once ordered the arrest of the adjutants of party member Hess,   who alone had any cognizance of these flights, and did not, contrary to the Fuhrer's orders, of which they were fully aware, either prevent or report the flight. In these circumstances, it must be considered that party member Hess either jumped out of his plane or has met with an accident.\nWhile it is true that his driver, bodyguard and two adjutants were arrested,  little punitive action was taken against others close to Hess. Karl and Albrecht Haushofer, his trusted geopolitical advisors, were arrested and detained, but neither was ill-treated and both were released without penalty. The aircraft designer Dr Willi Messerschmitt was merely rebuked by Goring, and no action at all taken against his chief test pilot Helmut Kaden (who had given Hess intensive instruction), or against Ernst Bohle, the chief of Hess's own foreign intelligence bureau, the Auslandorganisation. His wife Use and son Wolf were allowed to remain in their villa in the Munich suburb of Harlaching, and awarded a pension. Had Hess really acted alone, and against the express wishes of Hitler and the party in general, one might have expected the outcome to have been very different.\nIt has often been claimed that Hess was deliberately lured to Britain as part of an elaborate intelligence sting. This theory has spawned a number of books in recent years, including Hess: Flight for the Fuhrer by Peter Padfleld (1991), Ten Days That Saved the West by John Costello (also 1991), Churchill's Deception by Louis Kilzer (1994) and Hess: The British Conspiracy by John Harris and M.J. Trow (1999). Certainly this chimes with the theory favoured by Stalin, who initially believed that Britain was in league with Germany to destroy the Soviet Union, and that the Hess mission was engineered by British intelligence with the Duke of Hamilton as a go-between. Moreover the Russians had some difficulty in understanding why Hess was not immediately prosecuted as a war criminal, and instead detained in comfortable quarters to await a postwar trial. In October 1942 the party newspaper Pravda (Truth) declared:\nIt is no coincidence that Hess's wife has asked certain British representatives if she could join her husband. This could mean that she does not see her husband as a prisoner. It is high time we knew whether Hess is either a criminal or a plenipotentiary who represents the Nazi government in England.\nSeveral days later Pravda published a photograph of 'Mrs Hess' giving a piano recital in London. However this turned out to be Myra Hess, the well-known pianist who boosted wartime morale in London by playing lunchtime concerts to packed houses at the National Gallery. Indeed Churchill and Stalin argued over the point when they met for the Moscow conference in October 1944. Churchill recorded in a later memorandum:\nThe Russians are very suspicious of the Hess episode and I have had a lengthy argument with Marshal Stalin about it at Moscow in October, he   steadfastly maintaining that Hess had been invited over by our Secret Service. It is not in the public interest that the whole of this affair should be stirred at the present moment.\nThe intelligence sting theory is superficially attractive, if only because it would explain the dense veil of official secrecy which still surrounds much of the Hess affair. According to Padfield and Costello, MI5's Double Cross Committee masterminded the affair, while Harris and Trow favour the Special Operations Executive. Anthony Cave Brown concluded that the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) was behind the trap, while it has been suggested by Philip Knightley that MI6 induced Hess to come to Britain as they too favoured a negotiated peace with Germany. According to KGB sources, the traitor Kim Philby later revealed that SIS lured Hess to Britain by means of forged letters from the Duke of Hamilton, although Philby made no mention of this in his memoir My Secret War.\nThe greatest problem with the sting theory is that it is not supported by the conduct of the British authorities after Hess landed at Eaglesham. Had Hess been expected by the intelligence services, and by extension the military, it seems unlikely he would have been detained in a number of scout huts by the Home Guard for four hours until transferred to Maryhill Barracks in Glasgow. Even if the confusion on the ground in Scotland is explicable in the fog of war, the fact remains that Britain did nothing to exploit the windfall as a political and propaganda coup, or announce to the world that Hitler was suing for peace. Instead the flight of the Deputy Fuhrer to Scotland was announced to the world by Berlin, and only afterwards admitted by the British authorities on the most neutral terms. Far from being paraded before the world media, Hess was kept under close confinement for the next five years, and not seen in public until Nuremberg. If any photographs of Hess were taken between May 1941 and October 1945, not a single one has been released into the public domain. Even Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, expressed his bafflement. Moreover Hess himself seems never to have indicated that he was lured to Britain.\nProbably the most outlandish variation on this theme is the proposition that Hess was lured to Britain by bogus astrology. This fantastical notion was a favourite of spy writer Richard Deacon (alias Donald McCormick), who developed it at considerable length in books such as British Secret Service and 17F: The Life of lan Fleming, despite the fact that there is no verifiable (or even circumstantial) evidence to support it. According to Deacon, the luring of Hess was 'a brilliant coup' for which Fleming, the creator of James Bond, deserved full credit:\nHess, however, presented a somewhat easier target. Vanessa Hoffman's information convinced Fleming that while Canaris could not be won over by any faked horoscopes, Hess might well be exploited in this way . . . There was everything to be gained and nothing to be lost by planting faked   horoscopes on Hess. Fleming had discovered through various of his occultist friends such as Aleister Crowley and Ellic Howe that Hess regularly consulted astrologers, and that one of these was Karl Ernst Krafft. . . Exactly how the bogus horoscopes were worded, or the advice they gave to Hess, remains a mystery.\nAccording to Deacon, Fleming, in wartime a serving officer in the Naval Intelligence Division, was acquainted with infamous occultist Aleister Crowley,  and with Dennis Wheatley became involved in a 'very hush-hush' assignment called Operation Mistletoe. This in turn involved nocturnal occult rituals staged in the Ashdown Forest, involving 'a dummy dressed in a Nazi uniform, sat on a throne-like chair', with the object of influencing Hess. Deacon also stated that after Hess arrived, Fleming suggested he be questioned by Crowley. Others have cited the involvement of Maxwell Knight, Tom Driberg and Louis de Wohl in this same astrological plot. Deacon quoted with approval a claim by Nicholas Campion, cited as 'one of the founders of the Institute for the Study of Cycles in World Affairs and a leading astrologer', who in 1984 advised Deacon that he had:\nCast the horoscope for the time at which Hess took off from Germany. It was most inauspicious. It transpires that this is a most evil horoscope in any traditional sense, largely because six planets were in the house of death and two other points were strong: the fixed star Algol (which leads one to lose one's head) and the evil degree Serpentis, so called 'the accursed degree of the accursed sign.'\nAspects of this farrago of nonsense are repeated in books such as The Man Who Was M (Anthony Masters, 1984) and The Occult Conspiracy (Michael Howard, 1989). Yet in his own introduction Deacon had warned his readers that this tale of the luring of Rudolf Hess was 'far removed from reality' and 'totally bizarre'. In truth, the only contemporary references to Hess and astrology appeared in newspapers in London and Berlin on the same day. 14 May 1941. According to an article in the Volkischer Beobachter:\nAs is well-known in Party circles, Rudolf Hess was in poor health for many years and latterly increasingly had recourse to hypnotists, astrologers and so on. The extent to which these people are responsible for the mental confusion that led him to his present step has still to be clarified.\nIn London The Times published some highly speculative information supposedly received from a correspondent in Switzerland:\nCertain of Hess's closest friends have thrown an interesting light on the affair. They say that Hess has always been Hitler's astrologer in secret. Up to last March he had consistently predicted good fortune and had always been    right. Since then, notwithstanding the victories Germany has won, he has declared that the stars showed that Hitler's meteoric career was approaching its climax.\nThe detail disclosed by The Times was almost certainly official disinformation, with both newspaper reports intended to discredit Hess as deluded or mentally unstable. Hitler's motive for a policy of plausible denial in relation to the Hess peace mission have already been discussed. In Britain, however, very different reasons may lie behind the official policy of silence and secrecy surrounding Hess.\nThere is a strong body of evidence, not all of it circumstantial, that Rudolf Hess came to Britain expecting to conclude ongoing peace negotiations with senior officials, and then to fly back to Germany from Dungavel. In their minutely researched account Double Standards, Picknett, Prince and Prior offer the following facts in support of this argument. By May 1941 Britain was losing the war: Greece had fallen. Rommel was winning in North Africa. U-boats were sinking a colossal tonnage of Allied shipping, and Britain's cities were being heavily bombed from the air. At this time Churchill was by no means as popular as postwar myth suggests, having endured a vote of confidence on 7 May. In Britain there remained a strong peace lobby which included Lloyd George, Lord Halifax, Rab Butler, Lord Beaverbrook, Sir Nevile Henderson and Sir Samuel Hoare. It is also possible that senior figures within MI6, including Sir Stewart Menzies, favoured peace. Moreover other senior establishment figures had been pre-war members of the Anglo—German Fellowship, including the Duke of Hamilton. Hamilton later denied this, just as he denied meeting Hess at the Berlin Olympics in 1936, but in fact his own archives betray his membership of the Fellowship in 1936, while there is ample evidence of the meeting in Berlin from Henry Channon, Kenneth Lindsay and even Churchill. Hitler too wished to end the war in the west, as is clear from his 'last appeal to reason' of 19 July  1940, since the occupation and administration of Britain and the Empire would be a complicated task, and deplete those resources required for the planned attack on Russia. Against this background it seems more than likely that Hitler knew of, and endorsed, the Hess mission.\nAccording to the authors of Double Standards, their research suggests that the proposed terms of the armistice included a 25-year alliance between Britain and Germany, and the adoption by Britain of an attitude of 'benevolent neutrality' towards Germany's forthcoming war on the Soviet Union. Britain would continue to rule her Empire, while Germany would govern Europe. It is also suggested that there were detailed proposals regarding other issues, such as a reduction in strength of the Royal Navy and RAF. The main obstacle to the plan was the staunchly anti-Nazi Churchill, as the prime minister himself admitted to the Commons on 27 January 1942:\nWhen Rudolf Hess flew over here some months ago, he firmly believed that he had only to gain access to certain circles in this country for what he described   as 'the Churchill clique' to be thrown out of power and for a government to be set up with which Hitler could negotiate a magnanimous peace.\nSir Patrick Dollan, a former editor of the Glasgow Daily Herald and the then Lord Provost of Glasgow, seems to have been privy to inside information which he felt strongly should be made public. During a series of lectures given around the city in June 1941, Dollan made revelations which were summarised by the Bulletin and Scots Pictorial on 20 June, clearly having been missed by the censor:\nHess came here an unrepentant Nazi. He believed he could remain in Scotland for two days, discuss his peace proposals and be given petrol and maps to return to Germany.\nThe precise identity of those within the 'certain circles' to which Churchill alluded remains the subject of fierce debate, and is unlikely now to be established with any certainty. A wide-ranging study of pro-peace groupings in Britain before and during the Second World War can be found in Profits of Peace by Scott Newton, published in 1996. Some were pro-Hitler, but most appeasers simply wished to avoid another European war which would have a devastating effect on economic and social stability.\nIt is clear from a letter which the Duke of Hamilton published in The Times of 6 October 1939 that he too remained pro-peace even after the outbreak of war. The Hess affair caused the Duke of Hamilton a great deal of personal embarrassment, and led to his uttering a number of libel writs against journalists and Hess commentators until his death in 1973. It is only since then that historians have been able to publish detailed research. According to the authors of Double Standards, there is reason to believe that a reception committee awaited Hess at Dungavel House, which may have included the Duke of Kent and a Polish contingent, and that the mission went awry only after Hess failed to locate his destination and instead baled out over Eaglesham. Hamilton, then a serving Wing Commander stationed at RAF Turnhouse near Edinburgh, remained a Privy Councillor and a Keeper of the Royal Household. A former member of the Anglo-German Fellowship who had hoped to avoid war, he was also a friend and sponsor of Albrecht Haushofer, a close political advisor to Hess who had been privy to the flight from its inception.\nOn landing Hess asked to be taken to Hamilton, and although the official version holds that the Duke slept through the night and did not see 'Alfred Horn' until about 10 am the following day, at Maryhill Barracks, the evidence of his widow supports the theory that Hamilton in fact left his bed and went to meet Hess while the latter was being escorted to Maryhill. Indeed this was reported as fact by the Glasgow Herald on 16 May 1941, who added that 'representatives of the Intelligence Service and the Foreign Office were present'. Some have claimed that it would not have been possible for Hess to have landed his Bf 110 on the small grass airfield at Dungavel, but the strip was a  designated Emergency Landing Ground and there is evidence that a comparable Bristol Beaufighter set down safely there the previous month.\nWhat had initially been promoted as a crack in the Nazi regime was in danger of being recognised as a crack in the British hierarchy. Indeed rumours of collusion between Hess and people in high places, and whispers that Hamilton was a Quisling, quickly entered into circulation in Britain, raising the dread spectre of a Hidden Hand or fifth column. Although Churchill subsequently dismissed the Hess mission as merely an 'escapade', in truth he must have recognised it as a potential turning point in the war. In May 1941 the defeat of Germany hinged on two main factors: America joining the conflict, and Germany invading the Soviet Union, so that Stalin too would become a British ally. Little was revealed to the press about Hess, and Churchill made no statement to the Commons until January 1942. Rather than exploit Hess's arrival as propaganda for short-term gain, Churchill instead reversed the crisis to further his own ends. By accident or design, the truth slipped into print in America later in 1941, in the somewhat mystic book That Day Alone by the Canadian commentator Pierre van Paassen. According to van Paassen, Churchill pretended to negotiate with Hess in order to ensure that Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, to strengthen British ties with America, and to bring about the end of the Blitz. The book was published in abridged form in Britain in 1943, but with this passage deleted. It seems unlikely that van Paassen was privy to inside information. Nonetheless, the devastating night attack on London by 520 bombers on 10 May 1941 was the last significant German raid on the capital until the so-called Little Blitz early in 1944, which again suggests the complicity of Hitler in the Hess peace plan. In short. Churchill ruthlessly exploited the Hess affair to stifle the peace lobby, and those who wished to remove him from power.\nAnother persistent Hess legend is that the RAF did little or nothing to intercept Raid 42J, which in turn is offered as proof that Hess was expected and protected. Here the evidence is confusing. Three Spitfires from 72 Squadron based at Acklington attempted to intercept the Bf 110 as it crossed the Northumberland coast, and as it approached Glasgow an airborne Defiant night fighter from 141 Squadron at Ayr was alerted, although not scrambled as some accounts suggest. In Ten Days That Saved the West (1991), John Costello claimed that the Duke of Hamilton refused to allow fighters to attack Hess, and that anti-aircraft defences in the areas he overflew were ordered not to open fire. Both statements are incorrect. The sectors over which Hess passed were Ouston and Ayr, rather than Turnhouse, and both tried to shoot down the intruder. Moreover, for obvious reasons it was common practice for AA batteries to refrain from firing on enemy targets which were being pursued by the RAF, since this carried the risk of bringing down friendly aircraft. In 1999 it was claimed that two Czech Hurricane pilots from 245 Squadron, Vaclav Bauman and Leopold Srom, had been closing on Hess when their attack was inexplicably called off. Soon after returning to their base at Aldergrove in Northern Ireland, the two men were subjected to an intensive interrogation by     several senior RAP officers who arrived in an Avro Anson. Their story possibly tallies with an article published in the American Mercury in May 1943, which stated that 'two Hurricanes took off to trail the mystery plane with orders to force it down but under no conditions to shoot at it'. However, there is no record of Srom having flown that day in the Operations Record Book for 245 Squadron, while the convoy patrol undertaken by Bauman between 9.35 and 10.40 pm would not have taken him anywhere near Hess. In all likelihood the various other RAF pilots who claimed to have been scrambled to intercept Hess on 10 May were simply mistaken.\nSeveral sources have claimed that Hess was the target of an assassination attempt while at Mytchett Place. According to a former army intelligence officer named John McCowen, the three would-be killers were German and arrived by parachute near Luton Hoo on the night of 28 May 1941. After being captured and interrogated, the trio revealed that they had expected to find Hess at the London Cage at Cockfosters, and to obtain help from Abwehr agents already in Britain. They were later executed without trial at the Tower of London. Predictably there is no record of any such agents being captured in 1941, or executed, and the facts seem highly unlikely. In June 1942 Hess was moved from Mytchett to Maindiff Court near Abergavenny, apparently because it was feared that a group of Poles were planning to break into the camp, kidnap Hess, and beat or kill him by way of revenge for Nazi atrocities in Poland. Indeed in an MI5 file released by the PRO in 1999 there is an odd reference to a reported gun battle between Polish soldiers and guards at Mytchett, although no precise details are given. However, as with so many aspects of the Hess affair, the whole truth is never likely to emerge.\nMore imaginative even than the occult explanation of the Hess mission is the theory that the real Rudolf Hess was replaced with a double, and that the man who died at Spandau in 1987 was not the Deputy Fuhrer at all. The most celebrated proponent of the so-called doppelganger theory is Dr Hugh Thomas, a former army surgeon who examined Hess in September 1973 while attached to the British Military Hospital in Berlin. The publication of his book The Murder of Rudolf Hess in 1979 prompted questions in the House of Commons and the Bundestag, and generated further controversy in 1988 when it appeared in revised form under the title Hess: A Tale of Two Murders. Thomas relied on his own medical expertise. During the First World War Hess was known to have been wounded twice: once by shrapnel in June 1916, followed by a more serious chest wound caused by a rifle bullet on the Romanian front in July 1917. According to Thomas, the 'major scars on his chest and back' caused by both wounds should have been highly visible even after 60 years, yet were not recorded by any one of the 58 doctors who examined Hess after 1941. Thomas was unable to locate any detailed contemporary medical notes,  but made a number of assumptions which hypothesised extensive tissue damage and a large exit wound on the back. Thomas also accepted muddled assertions that Hess had been treated by the renowned chest surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch, whose technique for treating gunshot wounds usually     entailed the partial removal of a rib. The fact that Hess refused to see his wife and son until 1969 was also cited as further evidence... cont."

                "Columbus Day is a national holiday in many countries in the Americas and elsewhere which officially celebrates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in and discovery of the American Continent, which happened on October 12, 1492. The landing is celebrated as Columbus Day in the United States, as Día de la Raza (\"Day of the Race\") in many countries in Latin America and as Día de la Hispanidad and Fiesta Nacional in Spain, where it is also the religious festivity of la Virgen del Pilar. It is also celebrated as Día de las Américas (Day of the Americas) in Belize and Uruguay, as Discovery Day in the Bahamas, as Día del Respeto a la Diversidad Cultural (Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity) in Argentina and as Giornata Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo or Festa Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo in Italy and in the Little Italys around the world.   These holidays have been celebrated unofficially since the late 18th century and officially in various countries since the early 20th century.\n\nUnited States observance \n\nHistory \n\nColumbus Day first became an official state holiday in Colorado in 1906, and became a federal holiday in the United States in 1937, though people have celebrated Columbus's voyage since the colonial period. In 1792, New York City and other U.S. cities celebrated the 300th anniversary of his landing in the New World. President Benjamin Harrison called upon the people of the United States to celebrate Columbus Day on the 400th anniversary of the event. During the four hundredth anniversary in 1892, teachers, preachers, poets and politicians used Columbus Day rituals to teach ideals of patriotism. These patriotic rituals took themes such as citizenship boundaries, the importance of loyalty to the nation, and celebrating social progress.   \n\nMany Italian-Americans observe Columbus Day as a celebration of their heritage, the first occasion being in New York City on October 12, 1866.   Columbus Day was first enshrined as a legal holiday in the United States through the lobbying of Angelo Noce, a first generation Italian, in Denver. The first statewide Columbus Day holiday was proclaimed by Colorado governor Jesse F. McDonald in 1905, and it was made a statutory holiday in 1907.    In April 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus and New York City Italian leader Generoso Pope, Congress and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proclaimed October 12 a federal holiday under the name Columbus Day.  \n\nSince 1970 (Oct. 12), the holiday has been fixed to the second Monday in October,  coincidentally exactly the same day as Thanksgiving in neighboring Canada fixed since 1959. It is generally observed nowadays by banks, the bond market, the U.S. Postal Service, other federal agencies, most state government offices, many businesses, and most school districts. Some businesses and some stock exchanges remain open, and some states and municipalities abstain from observing the holiday.  The traditional date of the holiday also adjoins the anniversary of the United States Navy (founded October 13, 1775), and thus both occasions are customarily observed by the Navy (and usually the Marine Corps as well) with either a 72- or 96-hour liberty period.\n\nLocal observance of Columbus Day \n\nActual observance varies in different parts of the United States, ranging from large-scale parades and events to complete non-observance. Most states celebrate Columbus Day as an official state holiday, though many mark it as a \"Day of Observance\" or \"Recognition\" and at least four do not recognize it at all. Most states (including states where it is not a legal holiday) close schools and other state services, while others operate as normal.  \n\nSan Francisco claims the nation's oldest continuously existing celebration with the Italian-American community's annual Columbus Day Parade, which was established by Nicola Larco in 1868,  while New York City boasts the largest.   \n\nAs in the mainland U.S., Columbus Day is a legal holiday in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In the United States Virgin Islands, the day is celebrated as both Columbus Day and \"Puerto Rico Friendship Day\". \n\nVirginia also celebrates two legal holidays on the day, Columbus Day and Yorktown Victory Day, which honors the final victory at the Siege of Yorktown in the Revolutionary War. \n\nNon-observance \n\nThe U.S. states of Hawaii, Alaska, Oregon, and South Dakota do not recognize Columbus Day at all; however, Hawaii and South Dakota mark the day with an alternative holiday or observance. Hawaii celebrates Discoverers' Day, which commemorates the Polynesian discoverers of Hawaii on the same date, the second Monday of October,   though the name change has not ended protest related to the observance of Columbus' discovery.  The state government does not treat either Columbus Day or Discoverers' Day as a legal holiday;  state, city and county government offices and schools are open for business. On the other hand, South Dakota celebrates the day as an official state holiday known as \"Native American Day\" rather than Columbus Day.  Oregon does not recognize Columbus Day, neither as a holiday nor a commemoration; schools and public offices remain open.  Two additional states, Iowa and Nevada, do not celebrate Columbus Day as an official holiday, but the states' respective governors are \"authorized and requested\" by statute to proclaim the day each year. \n\nSeveral other states have removed Columbus Day as a paid holiday for government workers while still maintaining Columbus Day either as a day of recognition or a legal holiday for other purposes. These include California and Texas.   \n\nThe city of Berkeley, California, has replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous People's Day since 1992,  a move which has been followed by several other localities including Sebastopol and Santa Cruz, California; Dane County, Wisconsin; Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota; and Seattle, Washington.    Various tribal governments in Oklahoma designate the day \"Native American Day\", or name the day after their own tribe. \n\nLatin American observance \n\nDía de la Raza \n\nThe date Columbus arrived in the Americas is celebrated in many countries in Latin America.  The most common name for the celebration in Spanish (including in some Latin American communities  in the United States) is the Día de la Raza (\"day of the race\" or \"day of the [Hispanic] people\"), commemorating the first encounters of Europeans and Native Americans. The day was first celebrated in Argentina in 1917, Venezuela and Colombia in 1921, Chile in 1922, and Mexico in 1928. The day was also celebrated under this title in Spain until 1957, when it was changed to the Día de la Hispanidad (\"Hispanicity Day\"), and in Venezuela until 2002, when it was changed to the Día de la Resistencia Indígena (Day of Indigenous Resistance). Originally conceived of as a celebration of Hispanic influence in the Americas, as evidenced by the complementary celebrations in Spain and Latin America, Día de la Raza has come to be seen by indigenous activists throughout Latin America as a counter to Columbus Day; a celebration of the native races and cultures and of the resistance against the arrival of Europeans in the Americas.\n\nIn the U.S. Día de la Raza has served as a time of mobilization for pan-ethnic Latino activists, particularly in the 1960s. Since then, La Raza has served as a periodic rallying cry for Hispanic activists. The first Hispanic March on Washington occurred on Columbus Day in 1996. The name has remained in the largest Hispanic social justice organization, the National Council of La Raza.\n\nColombia\n\nColombia, the only country in the world with a name originated from Columbus himself, celebrates El día de la Raza y de la Hispanidad and is taken as an opportunity to celebrate the encounter of \"the two worlds\" and to reflect on the richness that the racial diversity has brought to the culture.\n\nVenezuela \n\nBetween 1921 and 2002, Venezuela celebrated Día de la Raza along with many other Latin American nations. The original holiday was officially established in 1921 under President Juan Vicente Gómez. In 2002, under president Hugo Chávez, the name was changed to Día de la Resistencia Indígena (Day of Indigenous Resistance) to commemorate the Indigenous peoples' resistance to European settlement. On October 12, 2004 a crowd of pro-government activists toppled the statue of Christopher Columbus in Caracas and sprayed allusive graffiti over its pedestal. The pro-Chávez website Aporrea wrote: \"Just like the statue of Saddam in Baghdad, that of Columbus the tyrant also fell this October 12, 2004 in Caracas\".  The famous toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue had occurred the previous year.\n\nCosta Rica \n\nSince 1994, Costa Rica had changed the official holiday from Día de la Raza to Día de las Culturas (Day of the cultures) to recognize the mix of European, American, African and Asian cultures that helped to compose Costa Rican (and Latin American) culture. \n\nCaribbean observance \n\nSome Caribbean countries also observe holidays related to Columbus Day. In Belize, October 12 is celebrated as Day of the Americas or Pan-American Day.   In the Bahamas, it was formerly known as Discovery Day, until 2001 when it was replaced with National Heroes Day.\n\nItaly \n\nSince the 18th century, many Italian communities in the Americas have observed the Discovery of the New World as a celebration of their heritage; Cristopher Columbus (called in Italian \"Cristoforo Colombo\") was an Italian explorer, citizen of the Republic of Genoa.\n\nIn Italy, Columbus Day has been officially celebrated since 2004. It is officially named Giornata nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo.\n\nThe \"Lega Navale Italiana\" has created a Regata di Colombo as a celebration of the Columbus achievement.  Italians have celebrated their \"Cristoforo Colombo\" naming after him many civilian and military ships, like the ocean liner Cristoforo Colombo.\n\nSpain \n\nSince 1987, Spain has celebrated the anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the Americas as its Fiesta Nacional or \"National Day\". Previously Spain had celebrated the day as Día de la Hispanidad, emphasizing Spain's ties with the Hispanidad, the international Hispanic community. In 1981 a royal decree established the Día de la Hispanidad as a national holiday. However, in 1987 the name was changed to Fiesta Nacional, and October 12 became one of two national celebrations, along with Constitution Day on December 6. Spain's \"national day\" had moved around several times during the various regime changes of the 20th century; establishing it on the day of the international Columbus celebration was part of a compromise between conservatives, who wanted to emphasize the status of the monarchy and Spain's history, and Republicans, who wanted to commemorate Spain's burgeoning democracy with an official holiday.\nSince 2000, October 12 has also been Spain's Day of the Armed Forces, celebrated each year with a military parade in Madrid. Other than this, however, the holiday is not widely or enthusiastically celebrated in Spain; there are no other large-scale patriotic parades, marches, or other events, and the observation is generally overshadowed by the feast day of Our Lady of the Pillar (Fiestas del Pilar).\n\nOpposition to Columbus celebrations \n\nOpposition to Columbus Day dates to at least the 19th century where activists had sought to eradicate Columbus Day celebrations because of its association with immigrants and the Knights of Columbus. Some non-Catholics were afraid it was being used to expand Catholic influence.  By far the more common opposition today, decrying Columbus's and Europeans' actions against the indigenous populations of the Americas, did not gain much traction until the latter half of the 20th century. This often controversial opposition, was led by some indigenous groups and left-wing political parties,   though in some areas it has spread into the mainstream.\n\nThere are different strands of this critique, which are interrelated. The first refers primarily to the indigenous populations and their treatment during the European colonization of the Americas which followed Columbus's discovery. Some are criticized for lack of historical rigor or consistency in their critique. The opponents of Columbus Day celebrations are considered to fail to distinguish between the diverse forms of European colonization, the events that took place in the different territories, or the widely varying treatment and rights given to the indigenous populations by the different powers. Some groups, especially in Spanish America are criticized for their allegedly biased discourse, which ignores the early forms of humanitarian laws for colonized peoples, decreed by the Crown of Castile in 1512, including the prohibition of slavery. The treatment of indigenous peoples did however vary greatly depending on the historical period and the colonizing power.\n\nSome groups such as the American Indian Movement, have argued that the responsibility of contemporary governments and their citizens for allegedly ongoing acts of genocide against Native Americans are masked by positive Columbus myths and celebrations. These critics argue that a particular understanding of the legacy of Columbus has been used to legitimize their actions, and it is this misuse of history that must be exposed.  F. David Peat asserts that many cultural myths of North America exclude or diminish the culture and myths of Native Americans. These cultural myths include ideas expressed by Michael Berliner of the Ayn Rand Institute claiming that Western civilization brought \"reason, science, self-reliance, individualism, ambition, and productive achievement\" to a people who were based in \"primitivism, mysticism, and collectivism\", and to a land that was “sparsely inhabited, unused, and underdeveloped\".  American anthropologist Jack Weatherford says that on Columbus Day, Americans celebrate the greatest waves of genocide of the American Indians known in history. \nAmerican Indian Movement of Colorado leader and activist Ward Churchill takes this argument further, contending that the mythologizing and celebration of the European settlement of the Americas in Columbus Day make it easier for people today to avoid taking responsibility for their own actions, or the actions of their governments regarding indigenous populations. He wrote in his book Bringing the Law Back Home:\n\nA second strain of the criticism of Columbus Day focuses on the character of Columbus himself. In time for the observation of Columbus Day in 2004, the final volume of a compendium of Columbus-era documents was published by the University of California, Los Angeles's Medieval and Renaissance Center. Geoffrey Symcox, the general editor of the project, asserted: \"While giving the brilliant mariner his due, the collection portrays Columbus as an unrelenting social climber and self-promoter who stopped at nothing— not even exploitation, slavery, or twisting Biblical scripture— to advance his ambitions… Many of the unflattering documents have been known for the last century or more, but nobody paid much attention to them until recently… The fact that Columbus brought slavery, enormous exploitation or devastating diseases to the Americas used to be seen as a minor detail—if it was recognized at all—in light of his role as the great bringer of white man's civilization to the benighted idolatrous American continent. But to historians today this information is very important. It changes our whole view of the enterprise\".\n\nHoward Zinn described some of the details of how Columbus personally ordered the enslavement and mutilation of the native Arawak people in a bid to repay his investors:\n\nMost critiques combine elements of both strains. Journalist and media critic Norman Solomon reflects in Columbus Day: A Clash of Myth and History that many people choose to hold on to the myths surrounding Columbus whereas historians who deal with the evidence are frequently depicted as politically correct revisionists. He quotes from the logbook Columbus's initial description of the American Indians: \"They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance.... They would make fine servants.... With 50 men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want\". In 1495, during the Second Voyage, American Indians were transported to Spain as slaves, many dying en route. \"Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity\", Columbus later wrote, \"go on sending all the slaves that can be sold\". Solomon states that the most important contemporary documentary evidence is the multi-volume History of the Indies by the Catholic priest Bartolomé de las Casas who observed the region where Columbus was governor. In contrast to \"the myth\" Solomon quotes Las Casas who describes Spaniards driven by \"insatiable greed\" — \"killing, terrorizing, afflicting, and torturing the native peoples\" with \"the strangest and most varied new methods of cruelty\" and how systematic violence was aimed at preventing \"[American] Indians from daring to think of themselves as human beings.\" The Spaniards \"thought nothing of knifing [American] Indians by tens and twenties and of cutting slices off them to test the sharpness of their blades\", wrote Las Casas. \"My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write\".\n\nIn the summer of 1990, 350 representatives from American Indian groups from all over the hemisphere, met in Quito, Ecuador, at the first Intercontinental Gathering of Indigenous People in the Americas, to mobilize against the quin-centennial celebration of Columbus Day. The following summer, in Davis, California, more than a hundred Native Americans gathered for a follow-up meeting to the Quito conference. They declared October 12, 1992, \"International Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People\". The largest ecumenical body in the United States, the National Council of Churches, called on Christians to refrain from celebrating the Columbus quincentennial, saying, \"What represented newness of freedom, hope, and opportunity for some was the occasion for oppression, degradation and genocide for others\".",
                "of territory claimed in Antarctica.\n\nChile (; ), officially the Republic of Chile (), is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about 1250000 km2 of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.\n\nThe arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth, principally copper. The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources, and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. \n\nSpain conquered and colonized Chile in the mid-16th century, replacing Inca rule in northern and central Chile, but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche that inhabited south-central Chile. After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818, Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic. In the 19th century, Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth, ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific (1879–83) after defeating Peru and Bolivia. In the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil. This development culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that overthrew Salvador Allende's democratically-elected left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing. The regime, headed by Augusto Pinochet, ended in 1990 after it lost a referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a center-left coalition which ruled through four presidencies until 2010.\n\nChile is today one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations. It leads Latin American nations in rankings of human development, competitiveness, income per capita, globalization, state of peace, economic freedom, and low perception of corruption.  It also ranks high regionally in sustainability of the state, and democratic development.  Chile is a founding member of the United Nations, the Union of South American Nations and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.\n\nEtymology\n\nThere are various theories about the origin of the word Chile. According to 17th-century Spanish chronicler Diego de Rosales,  the Incas called the valley of the Aconcagua \"Chili\" by corruption of the name of a Picunche tribal chief (\"cacique\") called Tili, who ruled the area at the time of the Incan conquest in the 15th century.   Another theory points to the similarity of the valley of the Aconcagua with that of the Casma Valley in Peru, where there was a town and valley named Chili.\n\nOther theories say Chile may derive its name from a Native American word meaning either \"ends of the earth\" or \"sea gulls\";  from the Mapuche word chilli, which may mean \"where the land ends;\"  or from the Quechua chiri, \"cold\",  or tchili, meaning either \"snow\"  or \"the deepest point of the Earth\".  Another origin attributed to chilli is the onomatopoeic cheele-cheele—the Mapuche imitation of the warble of a bird locally known as trile.\n\nThe Spanish conquistadors heard about this name from the Incas, and the few survivors of Diego de Almagro's first Spanish expedition south from Peru in 1535–36 called themselves the \"men of Chilli\". Ultimately, Almagro is credited with the universalization of the name Chile, after naming the Mapocho valley as such. The older spelling \"Chili\" was in use in English until at least 1900 before switching over to \"Chile\". \n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\n Stone tool evidence indicates humans sporadically frequented the Monte Verde valley area as long as 18,500 years ago.  About 10,000 years ago, migrating Native Americans settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present-day Chile. Settlement sites from very early human habitation include Monte Verde, Cueva del Milodon and the Pali Aike Crater's lava tube. The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, but the Mapuche (or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards) successfully resisted many attempts by the Inca Empire to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization.  They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the Battle of the Maule was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the Maule river.\n\nSpanish colonization\n\nIn 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the globe, Ferdinand Magellan discovered the southern passage now named after him, the Strait of Magellan, thus becoming the first European to set foot on what is now Chile. The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of Spanish conquistadors, who came from Peru in 1535 seeking gold. The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting.\n\nThe conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by Pedro de Valdivia, one of Francisco Pizarro's lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on 12 February 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the Spanish Empire.\n\nConquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive Mapuche insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of slavery by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference. \n\nCut off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche, to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean, Chile became one of the most centralized, homogeneous colonies in Spanish America. Serving as a sort of frontier garrison, the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain's European enemies, especially the British and the Dutch. Buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by Sir Francis Drake's 1578 raid on Valparaíso, the colony's principal port. Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru.\n\nThe first general census was conducted by the government of Agustín de Jáuregui between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5 percent of European descent, 7.9 percent mestizos, 8.6 percent indigenous peoples and 9.8 percent blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province of Chiloé, conducted a census in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4 percent of which were whites and 33.5 percent of which were natives.\n\nThe Diocese of Concepción conducted a census in areas south of the Maule river in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chiloé. The population is estimated at 210,567, 86.1 percent of which were Spanish or of European descent, 10 percent of which were indigenous and 3.7 percent of which were mestizos, blacks and mulattos. \n\nIndependence and nation building\n\nIn 1808, Napoleon's enthronement of his brother Joseph as the Spanish King precipitated the drive by the colony for independence from Spain. A national junta in the name of Ferdinand – heir to the deposed king – was formed on 18 September 1810. The Government Junta of Chile proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this day Chile celebrates its National Day on 18 September each year).\n\nAfter these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of José Miguel Carrera (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan José and Luis Carrera, soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the Reconquista led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from Bernardo O'Higgins, who challenged Carrera's leadership.\n\nIntermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort José de San Martín, hero of the Argentine War of Independence, led an army that crossed the Andes into Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818 Chile was proclaimed an independent republic. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the Roman Catholic Church. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.\n\nChile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chiloé was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Chañarcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valparaíso, which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying penetration into Araucanía and colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants in 1848. Through the founding of Fort Bulnes by the Schooner Ancud under the command of John Williams Wilson, the Magallanes region joined the country in 1843, while the Antofagasta area, at the time part of, Bolivia, began to fill with people.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by the Occupation of Araucanía. The Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan. As a result of the War of the Pacific with Peru and Bolivia (1879–83), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable nitrate deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.\n\nThe 1891 Chilean Civil War brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a vastly expensive naval arms race with Argentina that nearly led to a war.\n\n20th century\n\nThe Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling oligarchy. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, Arturo Alessandri, whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, Marxist groups with strong popular support arose.\n\nA military coup led by General Luis Altamirano in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a de facto dictatorship (although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled the rest of Latin America).  \n\nBy relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ibáñez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of Radical Party dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez del Campo to office for another six years. Jorge Alessandri succeeded Ibáñez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.\n\nThe 1964 presidential election of Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva by an absolute majority initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan \"Revolution in Liberty\", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and agrarian reform, including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals. \n\nIn the 1970 election, Senator Salvador Allende of the Socialist Party of Chile (then part of the \"Popular Unity\" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action), achieved a partial majority in a plurality of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party. Allende was not elected with an absolute majority, receiving fewer than 35 percent of votes.\n\nThe Chilean Congress conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president Jorge Alessandri and keeping with tradition, chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers party and could not make common cause with the right-wing.  \n\nAn economic depression that began in 1972 was exacerbated by capital flight, plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward.  Joint public-private public works projects helped reduce unemployment.  Much of the banking sector was nationalized. Many enterprises within the copper, coal, iron, nitrate, and steel industries were expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration's first year.\n\nAllende's program included advancement of workers' interests,  replacing the judicial system with \"socialist legality\", nationalization of banks and forcing others to bankruptcy, and strengthening \"popular militias\" known as MIR. Started under former President Frei, the Popular Unity platform also called for nationalization of Chile's major copper mines in the form of a constitutional amendment. The measure was passed unanimously by Congress.\n\nAs a result,  the Richard Nixon administration organized and inserted secret operatives in Chile, in order to swiftly destabilize Allende’s government.  In addition, US financial pressure restricted international economic credit to Chile. \n\nThe economic problems were also exacerbated by Allende's public spending which was financed mostly by printing money and poor credit ratings given by commercial banks. \nSimultaneously, opposition media, politicians, business guilds and other organizations helped to accelerate a campaign of domestic political and economical destabilization, some of which was backed by the United States.  By early 1973, inflation was out of control. The crippled economy was further battered by prolonged and sometimes simultaneous strikes by physicians, teachers, students, truck owners, copper workers, and the small business class.\nOn 26 May 1973, Chile’s Supreme Court, which was opposed to Allende's government, unanimously denounced the Allende disruption of the legality of the nation. Although illegal under the Chilean constitution, the court supported and strengthened Pinochet's seizure of power. \n\nPinochet era (1973–1990)\n\nA military coup overthrew Allende on 11 September 1973. As the armed forces bombarded the presidential palace, Allende apparently committed suicide.   After the coup, Henry Kissinger told U.S. president Richard Nixon that the United States had \"helped\" the coup. \n\nA military junta, led by General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, took control of the country. The first years of the regime were marked by human rights violations. On October 1973, at least 72 people were murdered by the Caravan of Death.  According to the Rettig Report and Valech Commission, at least 2,115 were killed,  and at least 27,265 were tortured (including 88 children younger than 12 years old). In 2011, Chile recognized an additional 9,800 victims, bringing the total number of killed, tortured or imprisoned for political reasons to 40,018.  At the national stadium, filled with detainees, one of those tortured and killed was internationally known poet-singer Victor Jara (see \"Music and Dance\", below). The stadium was renamed for Jara in 2003.\n\nA new Constitution was approved by a controversial plebiscite on 11 September 1980, and General Pinochet became president of the republic for an eight-year term. After Pinochet obtained rule of the country, several hundred committed Chilean revolutionaries joined the Sandinista army in Nicaragua, guerrilla forces in Argentina or training camps in Cuba, Eastern Europe and Northern Africa. \n\nIn the late 1980s, largely as a result of events such as the 1982 economic collapse  and mass civil resistance in 1983–88, the government gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, speech, and association, to include trade union and political activity.  The government launched market-oriented reforms with Hernán Büchi as Minister of Finance. Chile moved toward a free market economy that saw an increase in domestic and foreign private investment, although the copper industry and other important mineral resources were not opened for competition. In a plebiscite on 5 October 1988, Pinochet was denied a second eight-year term as president (56% against 44%). Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a two-chamber congress on 14 December 1989. Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin, the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties called the Concertación, received an absolute majority of votes (55%).  President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition period.\n\nIn December 1993, Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the son of previous president Eduardo Frei Montalva, led the Concertación coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes (58%). \n\n21st century\n\nFrei Ruiz-Tagle was succeeded in 2000 by Socialist Ricardo Lagos, who won the presidency in an unprecedented runoff election against Joaquín Lavín of the rightist Alliance for Chile. In January 2006, Chileans elected their first female president, Michelle Bachelet Jeria, of the Socialist Party, defeating Sebastián Piñera, of the National Renewal party, extending the Concertación governance for another four years.   In January 2010, Chileans elected Sebastián Piñera as the first rightist President in 20 years, defeating former President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle of the Concertación, for a four-year term succeeding Bachelet. Due to term limits, Sebastián Piñera did not stand for re-election in 2013, and his term expired in March 2014 resulting in Michelle Bachelet returning to office.\n\nOn 27 February 2010, Chile was struck by an 8.8 MW earthquake, the fifth largest ever recorded at the time. More than 500 people died (most from the ensuing tsunami) and over a million people lost their homes. The earthquake was also followed by multiple aftershocks.  Initial damage estimates were in the range of US$15–30 billion, around 10 to 15 percent of Chile's real gross domestic product. \n\nChile achieved global recognition for the successful rescue of 33 trapped miners in 2010. On 5 August 2010 the access tunnel collapsed at the San José copper and gold mine in the Atacama Desert near Copiapó in northern Chile, trapping 33 men 700 m below ground. A rescue effort organized by the Chilean government located the miners 17 days later. All 33 men were brought to the surface two months later on 13 October 2010 over a period of almost 24 hours, an effort that was carried on live television around the world. \n\nGeography, climate, and environment\n\nA long and narrow coastal Southern Cone country on the west side of the Andes Mountains, Chile stretches over 4300 km north to south, but only 350 km at its widest point east to west.  This encompasses a remarkable variety of climates and landscapes. It contains 756950 km2 of land area. It is situated within the Pacific Ring of Fire. Excluding its Pacific islands and Antarctic claim, Chile lies between latitudes 17° and 56°S, and longitudes 66° and 75°W.\n\nChile is among the longest north-south countries in the world. If one considers only mainland territory, Chile is unique within this group in its narrowness from east to west, with the other long north-south countries (including Brazil, Russia, Canada, and the United States, among others) all being wider from east to west by a factor of more than 10. Chile also claims 1250000 km2 of Antarctica as part of its territory (Chilean Antarctic Territory). However, this latter claim is suspended under the terms of the Antarctic Treaty, of which Chile is a signatory.  It is the world's southernmost country that is geographically on the mainland. \n\nChile controls Easter Island and Sala y Gómez Island, the easternmost islands of Polynesia, which it incorporated to its territory in 1888, and Robinson Crusoe Island, more than 600 km from the mainland, in the Juan Fernández Islands. Also controlled but only temporarily inhabited (by some local fishermen) are the small islands of San Ambrosio and San Felix. These islands are notable because they extend Chile's claim to territorial waters out from its coast into the Pacific Ocean. \n\nThe northern Atacama Desert contains great mineral wealth, primarily copper and nitrates. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area is also the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border.\n\nLargest cities\n\n.\n\nClimate\n\nThe diverse climate of Chile ranges from the world's driest desert in the north—the Atacama Desert—through a Mediterranean climate in the center, humid subtropical in Easter Island, to an oceanic climate, including alpine tundra and glaciers in the east and south.  According to the Köppen system, Chile within its borders hosts at least ten major climatic subtypes. There are four seasons in most of the country: summer (December to February), autumn (March to May), winter (June to August), and spring (September to November).\n\nBiodiversity\n\nChile's geographical isolation has also restricted the immigration of faunal life, so that only a few of the many distinctive South American animals are found. Among the larger mammals are the puma or cougar, the llama-like guanaco and the fox-like chilla. In the forest region, several types of marsupials and a small deer known as the pudu are found.\n\nThere are many species of small birds, but most of the larger common Latin American types are absent. Few freshwater fish are native, but North American trout have been successfully introduced into the Andean lakes. Owing to the vicinity of the Humboldt Current, ocean waters abound with fish and other forms of marine life, which in turn support a rich variety of waterfowl, including several penguins. Whales are abundant, and some six species of seals are found in the area.\n\nJust over 3,000 species of fungi are recorded in Chile,   but this number is far from complete. The true total number of fungal species occurring in Chile is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7 percent of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.  Although the amount of available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Chile, and 1995 species have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the country. \n\nThe northernmost coastal and central region is largely barren of vegetation, approaching the most closely an absolute desert in the world.\nOn the slopes of the Andes, besides the scattered tola desert brush, grasses are found. The central valley is characterized by several species of cacti, the hardy espinos, the Chilean pine, the southern beeches and the copihue, a red bell-shaped flower that is Chile's national flower.\n\nIn southern Chile, south of the Biobío River, heavy precipitation has produced dense forests of laurels, magnolias, and various species of conifers and beeches, which become smaller and more stunted to the south.\n\nThe cold temperatures and winds of the extreme south preclude heavy forestation. Grassland is found in Atlantic Chile (in Patagonia). Much of the Chilean flora is distinct from that of neighboring Argentina, indicating that the Andean barrier existed during its formation.\n\nFlora\n\nThe native flora of Chile is characterized by a higher degree of endemism and relatively fewer species compared to the flora of other countries of South America. A classification of this flora necessitates its division into at least three general zones: the desert provinces of the north, Central Chile, and the humid regions of the south.\n\nFauna\n\nThe fauna of Chile is characterized by a high degree of endemism, due to its particular geography. In continental Chile, the Atacama Desert in the north and the Andes mountains to the east are barriers that have led to the isolation of flora and fauna. Add to that the enormous extension in length (over 4200 km) this results in a wide range of climates and environments.\n\nFile:Puma2.jpg |Puma in Chile (cougar)\nFile:Araucaria araucana - Parque Nacional Conguillío por lautaroj - 001.jpg|Araucaria araucana trees in Conguillío National Park\nFile:Pudupuda hem 8 FdoVidal Villarr 08Abr06-PhotoJimenez.JPG|Pudú in Chile\nFile:Zorrito Chile.JPG|Chilla fox, common in the region\nFile:Colca-condor-c07.jpg|Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), the national bird of Chile\nFile:Culpeo MC.jpg|Lycalopex culpaeus, a culpeo or Andean fox\nFile:Guanaco 09.24.jpg|A guanaco in northern Chile\nFile:Cuernos del Paine from Lake Pehoé.jpg|Torres del Paine from Lake Pehoé, Torres del Paine National Park, Chile\n\nTopography\n\nChile is located along a highly seismic and volcanic zone, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, due to the subduction of the Nazca and Antarctic plates in the South American plate.\n\nLate Paleozoic, 251 million years ago, Chile belonged to the continental block called Gondwana. It was just a depression accumulated marine sediments began to rise at the end of the Mesozoic, 66 million years ago, due to the collision between the Nazca and South American plates, resulting in the Andes. The territory would be shaped by millions of years due to the folding of the rocks, forming the current relief.\n\nThe Chilean relief consists of the central depression, which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with Bolivia and Argentina, with its most alton 18 located on the Nevado Ojos del Salado, at 6891.3 m, the highest volcano in the world, in the region of Atacama and Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes, with its highest point located on the hill Vicuña Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra Vicuña Mackenna, the south of Antofagasta. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.\n\nThe Far North is the area between the northern boundary of the country and the parallel 26° S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the Atacama desert, the most arid in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams that originate in the area known as the pampas Tamarugal. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs Bolivia, has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the Salar de Atacama, due to the gradual accumulation of sediments over time.\n\nTo the south is the Norte Chico, extending to the Aconcagua river. Los Andes begin to decrease its altitude to the south and closer to the coast, reaching 90 km away at the height of Illapel, the narrowest part of the Chilean territory. The two mountain ranges intersect, virtually eliminating the intermediate depression. The existence of rivers flowing through the territory allows the formation of transverse valleys, where agriculture has developed strongly in recent times, while the coastal plains begin to expand.\n\nThe Central area is the most populated region of the country. The coastal plains are wide and allow the establishment of cities and ports along the Pacific, while the coastal mountains down its height. The Andes maintains altitudes above 6000m but descend slowly starts approaching the 4000 meters on average. The intermediate depression reappears becoming a fertile valley that allows agricultural development and human settlement, due to sediment accumulation. To the south, the Cordillera de la Costa reappears in the range of Nahuelbuta while glacial sediments originate a series of lakes in the area of La Frontera.\n\nPatagonia extends from within Reloncavi, at the height of parallel 41 ° S, to the south. During the last glaciation, this area was covered by ice that strongly eroded Chilean relief structures. As a result, the intermediate depression sinks in the sea, while the coastal mountains rise to a series of archipelagos, such as Chiloé and the Chonos, disappearing in Taitao peninsula, in the parallel 47 ° S. The Andes mountain range loses height and erosion caused by the action of glaciers has caused fjords.\n\nEast of the Andes, on the continent, or north of it, on the island of Tierra del Fuego are located relatively flat plains, which in the Strait of Magellan cover large areas.\n\nThe Andes, as he had done previously Cordillera de la Costa, begins to break in the ocean causing a myriad of islands and islets and disappear into it, sinking and reappearing in the Southern Antilles arc and then the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is called Antartandes, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, lying between the meridians 53 ° W and 90 ° W.\n\nIn the middle of the Pacific, the country has sovereignty over several islands of volcanic origin, collectively known as Insular Chile. Of these, we highlight the archipelago of Juan Fernandez and Easter Island, which is located in the fracture zone between the Nazca plate and the Pacific plate known as East Pacific Rise.\n\nHydrography\n\nDue to the characteristics of the territory, Chile is crossed by numerous rivers generally short in length and with low torrential flow. They commonly extend from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean, flowing in an East to West direction.\n\nBecause of the desert, in the Norte Grande there are only short endorheic character streams, except for the river Loa, the longest in the country 440 km. In the high valleys, wetland areas generate Chungará Lake, located at 4500 meters above sea level. It and the river Lauca are shared with Bolivia, as well as the Lluta.\n\nIn the center-north of the country, the number of rivers that form valleys of agricultural importance increases. Noteworthy are the Elqui with 75 km  long, 142 km Aconcagua, Maipo with 250 km  and its tributary, the Mapocho with 110 km, and Maule with 240 km. Their waters mainly flow from Andean snowmelt in the summer and winter rains. The major lakes in this area are the artificial lake Rapel, the Colbun Maule lagoon and the lagoon of La Laja.\n\nDemographics\n\nChile's 2002 census reported a population of 15 million people. Its rate of population growth has been decreasing since 1990, due to a declining birth rate.  By 2050 the population is expected to reach approximately 20.2 million people.  About 85 percent of the country's population lives in urban areas, with 40 percent living in Greater Santiago. The largest agglomerations according to the 2002 census are Greater Santiago with 5.6 million people, Greater Concepción with 861,000\nand Greater Valparaíso with 824,000. \n\nAncestry and ethnicity\n\nMexican professor Francisco Lizcano, of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, estimated that 52.7% of Chileans were white, 39.3% were mestizo, and 8% were Amerindian. \n\nThe most recent study in the Candela Project establishes that the genetic composition of Chile is 52% of European origin, with 44% of the genome coming from Native Americans (Amerindians), and 4% coming from Africa, making Chile a primarily mestizo country with traces of African descent present in half of the population.  Another genetic study conducted by the University of Brasilia in several American countries shows a similar genetic composition for Chile, with a European contribution of 51.6%, an Amerindian (Native) contribution of 42.1%, and an African contribution of 6.3%.\n\nA public health booklet from the University of Chile states that 30% of the population is of Caucasian origin; \"predominantly White\" Mestizos are estimated to amount a total of 65%, while Native Americans (Amerindians) comprise the remaining 5%. \n\nDespite the genetic considerations, many Chileans, if asked, would self-identify as White. The 2011 Latinobarómetro survey asked respondents in Chile what race they considered themselves to belong to. Most answered \"White\" (59%), while 25% said \"Mestizo\" and 8% self-classified as \"indigenous\".  A 2002 national poll revealed that a majority of Chileans believed they possessed some (43.4%) or much (8.3%) \"indigenous blood\", while 40.3% responded that they had none. \n\nThe 1907 census reported 101,118 Indians, or 3.1% of the total population. Only those that practiced their native culture or spoke their native language were considered to be Indians, irrespective of their \"racial purity\". \n\nIn 2002 a census took place, directly asking the public whether they considered themselves as part of any of the eight Chilean ethnic groups, regardless of whether or not they maintained their culture, traditions and language, and 4.6 percent of the population (692,192 people) fitted that description of indigenous peoples in Chile. Of that number, 87.3% declared themselves Mapuche.  Most of the indigenous population shows varying degrees of mixed ancestry. \n\nChile is one of 22 countries to have signed and ratified the only binding international law concerning indigenous peoples, the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.  It was adopted in 1989 as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169. Chile ratified it in 2008. A Chilean court decision in November 2009 considered to be a landmark ruling on indigenous rights and made use of the convention. The Supreme Court decision on Aymara water rights upheld rulings by both the Pozo Almonte tribunal and the Iquique Court of Appeals, and marks the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile. \n\nChile was never a particularly attractive destination for migrants, owing to its remoteness and distance from Europe. Europeans preferred to stay in countries closer to their homelands instead of taking the long journey through the Straits of Magellan or crossing the Andes. European migration did not result in a significant change in the ethnic composition of Chile, except in the region of Magellan.[http://www.ine.cl/canales/usuarios/cedoc_online/censos/pdf/censo_1907.pdf Censo de población de 1907, page-PDF 55/1277 and page-PDF 1249/1277 Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas de Chile] Spaniards were the only major European migrant group to Chile, and there was never large-scale immigration such as that to Argentina or Uruguay. Between 1851 and 1924, Chile only received 0.5% of European immigration to Latin America, compared to 46% to Argentina, 33% to Brazil, 14% to Cuba, and 4% to Uruguay. However, it is undeniable that immigrants have played a significant role in Chilean society.\n\nOther groups of Europeans have followed but are found in smaller numbers, like the descendants of Austrians  and Dutch people. Currently, these are estimated at about 50,000 people.  After the failed liberal revolution of 1848 in the German states,   a noticeable German immigration took place, laying the foundation for the German-Chilean community. Sponsored by the Chilean government to \"unbarbarize\" and colonize the southern region, these Germans (including German-speaking Swiss, Silesians, Alsatians and Austrians) settled mainly in Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue. \n\nDescendants of different European ethnic groups often intermarried in Chile. This intermarriage and mixture of cultures and races have helped to shape the present society and culture of the Chilean middle and upper classes. \n\nDue in part to its economic fortunes, Chile has recently become a new magnet for immigrants, mostly from neighboring Argentina, Bolivia and mainly Peru.  According to the 2002 national census, Chile's foreign-born population has increased by 75% since 1992.  According to an estimate by the Migration and Foreign Residency Department, 317,057 foreigners were living in Chile as of December 2008.  Roughly 500,000 of Chile’s population is of full or partial Palestinian origin.  \n\nReligion\n\n, 66.6% of Chilean population over 15 years of age claimed to be of Catholic creed – a decrease from the 70%  reported by the 2002 census – while 17 percent reported adherence to a evangelical church. In the census, the term evangelical referred to all non-Catholic Christian churches with the exception of the Orthodox Church (Greek, Persian, Serbian, Ukrainian, and Armenian), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Seventh-day Adventists, and Jehovah's Witnesses, essentially limiting it to the Protestants (although Adventism is often considered a part of it). Approximately 90 percent of Protestants (evangelicals) are Pentecostal. Wesleyan, Lutheran, Reformed Evangelical, Presbyterian, Anglican, Episcopalian, Baptist and Methodist churches are also present.  Irreligious people, atheists, and agnostics account for around 12 percent of the population.\n\nCurrently in 2015, the majority religion in Chile is Christianity (68%), with an estimated 55% of Chileans belonging to the Catholic church, 13% Protestant or Evangelical and just 7% with any other religion. Agnostics and atheist are estimated at 25%. \n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contribute to the generally free practice of religion. The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors.\n\nChurch and state are officially separate in Chile. The 1999 law on religion prohibits religious discrimination. However, the Catholic Church enjoys a privileged status and occasionally receives preferential treatment. Government officials attend Catholic events as well as major Protestant and Jewish ceremonies.\n\nThe Government-observed religious holidays include Christmas, Good Friday, the Feast of the Virgin of Carmen, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, the Feast of the Assumption, All Saints' Day, and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception as national holidays. The government has recently declared 31 October, Reformation Day, a public national holiday, in honor of the Protestant churches of the country.  \n\nThe patron saints of Chile are Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint James the Greater (Santiago).  In 2005, St. Alberto Hurtado was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI and became the country's second saint after St. Teresa de los Andes. \n\nLanguages\n\nThe Spanish spoken in Chile is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of neighboring South American countries because final syllables and \"s\" sounds are often dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation. Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.\n\nThere are several indigenous languages spoken in Chile: Mapudungun, Quechua, Aymara and Rapa Nui. After the Spanish invasion, Spanish took over as the lingua franca and the indigenous languages have become minority languages, with some now extinct or close to extinction. \n\nGerman is still spoken to some extent in southern Chile,  either in small country side pockets or as a second language among the communities of larger cities.\n\nThrough initiatives such as the English Opens Doors Program, the government made English mandatory for students in fifth-grade and above in public schools. Most private schools in Chile start teaching English from kindergarten.  Common English words have been absorbed and appropriated into everyday Spanish speech. \n\nIdentity and traditions\n\nDue to the geography of Chile dissimilar cultural expressions vary markedly in different parts of the country.\n\nGovernment and politics \n\nThe current Constitution of Chile was approved in a national plebiscite —regarded as \"highly irregular\" by some observers — in September 1980, under the military government of Augusto Pinochet. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet's defeat in the 1988 plebiscite, the constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and senators for life, granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years. \n\nThe Congress of Chile has a 38-seat Senate and a 120-member Chamber of Deputies. Senators serve for eight years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every 4 years. The last congressional elections were held on 17 November 2013, concurrently with the presidential election. The current Senate has a 21–15 split in favor of the governing coalition and 2 independents. The current lower house-the Chamber of Deputies-contains 67 members of the governing center-left coalition, 48 from the center-right opposition and 5 from small parties or independents. The Congress is located in the port city of Valparaíso, about 140 km west of the capital, Santiago.\n\nChile's congressional elections are governed by a binomial system that, for the most part, rewards the two largest representations equally, often regardless of their relative popular support. Parties are thus forced to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertación and Alianza) split most of the seats. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats, which tends to lock the legislative in a roughly 50-50 split.\n\nChile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the Supreme Court of Chile. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide overhaul of its criminal justice system.  The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to that of the United States.\n\nIn the 2001 congressional elections, the conservative Independent Democratic Union (UDI) surpassed the Christian Democrats for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house. In the 2005 parliamentary election, both leading parties, the Christian Democrats and the UDI lost representation in favor of their respective allies Socialist Party (which became the biggest party in the Concertación block) and National Renewal in the right-wing alliance. In the 2009 legislative elections in Chile, the Communist Party won 3 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 30 years (the Communist Party was not allowed to exist as such during the dictatorship).\n\nChileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on 17 November 2013. None of the nine presidential candidates got more than 50 percent of the vote. As a result, the top two candidates, center-left Nueva Mayoría coalition's Michelle Bachelet and center-right Alianza coalition's Evelyn Matthei, competed in a run-off election on 15 December 2013, which Bachelet won. This was Chile's sixth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era. All six have been judged free and fair. The president is constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms.\n\nForeign relations \n\nSince the early decades after independence, Chile has always had an active involvement in foreign affairs. In 1837 the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru's port of Callao for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the Peru-Bolivian Confederation (1836–39) in the War of the Confederation. The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the War of the Pacific (1879–83), further increased Chile's regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Chile's commercial ties were primarily with Britain, a nation that had a major influence on the formation of the Chilean navy. The French influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the turn of the 20th century. German influence came from the organization and training of the army by Prussians.\n\nOn 26 June 1945, Chile participated as a founding member of the United Nations being among 50 countries that signed the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, California.    With the military coup of 1973, Chile became isolated politically as a result of widespread human rights abuses.\n\nSince its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena. Chile completed a 2-year non-permanent position on the UN Security Council in January 2005. Jose Miguel Insulza, a Chilean national, was elected Secretary General of the Organization of American States in May 2005 and confirmed in his position, being re-elected in 2009. Chile is currently serving on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, and the 2007–2008 chair of the board is Chile's ambassador to the IAEA, Milenko E. Skoknic. The country is an active member of the UN family of agencies and participates in UN peacekeeping activities. It was re-elected as a member of the UN Human Rights Council in 2011 for a three-year term.  It was also elected to one of five non-permanent seats on the UN Security Council in 2013.  Chile hosted the Defense Ministerial of the Americas in 2002 and the APEC summit and related meetings in 2004. It also hosted the Community of Democracies ministerial in April 2005 and the Ibero-American Summit in November 2007. An associate member of Mercosur and a full member of APEC, Chile has been a major player in international economic issues and hemispheric free trade.\n\nThe Chilean Government has diplomatic relations with most countries. It settled all its territorial disputes with Argentina during the 1990s except for part of the border at Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Chile and Bolivia severed diplomatic ties in 1978 over Bolivia's desire to regain sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean it lost to Chile in 1879–83 War of the Pacific. The two countries maintain consular relations and are represented at the Consul General level.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nChile is divided into 15 regions, each headed by an intendant appointed by the president. The regions are further divided into provinces, with provincial governors also appointed by the president. Finally each province is divided into communes  which are administered by municipalities, each with its own mayor and council elected for four-year terms. Each region is designated by a name and a Roman numeral, assigned from north to south. The only exception is the Santiago Metropolitan Region which is designated RM (Región Metropolitana). Two new regions were created in 2006 and became operative in October 2007; Los Ríos in the south (Region XIV), and Arica y Parinacota in the north (Region XV). The numbering scheme skipped Region XIII, usually assumed to be the Metropolitan Region before the 2006 reform.\n\nNational symbols\n\nThe national flower is the copihue (Lapageria rosea, Chilean bellflower), which grows in the woods of southern Chile.\n\nThe coat of arms depicts the two national animals: the condor (Vultur gryphus, a very large bird that lives in the mountains) and the huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus, an endangered white tail deer). It also has the legend Por la razón o la fuerza (By reason or by force).\n\nThe flag of Chile consists of two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red; there is a blue square the same height as the white band at the hoist-side end of the white band; the square bears a white five-pointed star in the center representing a guide to progress and honor; blue symbolizes the sky, white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to achieve independence. The flag of Chile is similar to the Flag of Texas, although the Chilean flag is 21 years older. However, like the Texan flag, the flag of Chile is modeled after the Flag of the United States. \n\nMilitary\n\nThe Armed Forces of Chile are subject to civilian control exercised by the president through the Minister of Defense. The president has the authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces.\n\nThe commander in chief of the Chilean Army is General Humberto Oviedo Arriagada.   The Chilean Army is 45,000 strong and is organized with an Army headquarters in Santiago, six divisions throughout its territory, an Air Brigade in Rancagua, and a Special Forces Command in Colina. The Chilean Army is one of the most professional and technologically advanced armies in Latin America.\n\nAdmiral Enrique Larrañaga Martin directs the 21,773-person Chilean Navy,  including 2,500 Marines. Of the fleet of 29 surface vessels, only eight are operational major combatants (frigates). Those ships are based in Valparaíso.  The Navy operates its own aircraft for transport and patrol; there are no Navy fighter or bomber aircraft. The Navy also operates four submarines based in Talcahuano. \n\nAir Force General (four star) Jorge Rojas Ávila heads the 12,500 strong Chilean Air Force. Air assets are distributed among five air brigades headquartered in Iquique, Antofagasta, Santiago, Puerto Montt, and Punta Arenas. The Air Force also operates an airbase on King George Island, Antarctica. The Air Force took delivery of the final two of ten F-16s, all purchased from the U.S., in March 2007 after several decades of U.S. debate and previous refusal to sell. Chile also took delivery in 2007 of a number of reconditioned Block 15 F-16s from the Netherlands, bringing to 18 the total of F-16s purchased from the Dutch.\n\nAfter the military coup in September 1973 the Chilean national police (Carabineros) were incorporated into the Defense Ministry. With the return of democratic government, the police were placed under the operational control of the Interior Ministry but remained under the nominal control of the Defense Ministry. Gen. Gustavo González Jure is the head of the national police force of 40,964  men and women who are responsible for law enforcement, traffic management, narcotics suppression, border control, and counter-terrorism throughout Chile.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe Central Bank of Chile in Santiago serves as the central bank for the country. The Chilean currency is the Chilean peso (CLP). Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations, leading Latin American nations in human development, competitiveness, income per capita, globalization, economic freedom, and low perception of corruption. Since July 2013, Chile is considered by the World Bank as a \"high-income economy\".   \n\nChile has the highest degree of economic freedom in South America (ranking 7th worldwide), owing to its independent and efficient judicial system and prudent public finance management. In May 2010 Chile became the first South American country to join the OECD.  In 2006, Chile became the country with the highest nominal GDP per capita in Latin America. \n\nCopper mining makes up 20% of Chilean GDP and 60% of exports. Escondida is the largest copper mine in the world, producing over 5% of global supplies. Overall, Chile produces a third of the world’s copper. Codelco, the state mining firm, competes with private ones.\n\nSound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady economic growth in Chile and have more than halved poverty rates. Chile began to experience a moderate economic downturn in 1999. The economy remained sluggish until 2003, when it began to show clear signs of recovery, achieving 4.0% GDP growth.  The Chilean economy finished 2004 with growth of 6 percent. Real GDP growth reached 5.7 percent in 2005 before falling back to 4 percent in 2006. GDP expanded by 5 percent in 2007. Faced with an international economic downturn the government announced an economic stimulus plan to spur employment and growth, and despite the global financial crisis, aimed for an expansion of between 2 percent and 3 percent of GDP for 2009. Nonetheless, economic analysts disagreed with government estimates and predicted economic growth at a median of 1.5 percent.  Real GDP growth in 2012 was 5.5%. Growth slowed to 4.1% in the first quarter of 2013.\n\nThe unemployment rate was 6.4% in April 2013.  There are reported labor shortages in agriculture, mining, and construction. The percentage of Chileans with per capita household incomes below the poverty line—defined as twice the cost of satisfying a person's minimal nutritional needs—fell from 45.1 percent in 1987 to 11.5 percent in 2009, according to government surveys.   Critics in Chile, however, argue that true poverty figures are considerably higher than those officially published.  Using the relative yardstick favoured in many European countries, 27% of Chileans would be poor, according to Juan Carlos Feres of the ECLAC. \n\nAs of November 2012, about 11.1 million people (64% of the population) benefit from government welfare programs,  via the \"Social Protection Card\", which includes the population living in poverty and those at a risk of falling into poverty. \n\nThe privatized national pension system (AFP) has encouraged domestic investment and contributed to an estimated total domestic savings rate of approximately 21 percent of GDP.  Under the compulsory private pension system, most formal sector employees pay 10 percent of their salaries into privately managed funds. However, by 2009, it has been reported that had been lost from the pension system to the global financial crisis. \n\nChile has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with a whole network of countries, including an FTA with the United States that was signed in 2003 and implemented in January 2004.  Internal Government of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and the recent high price of copper, bilateral trade between the U.S. and Chile has grown over 60 percent since then. Chile's total trade with China reached US in 2006, representing nearly 66 percent of the value of its trade relationship with Asia. Exports to Asia increased from US in 2005 to US in 2006, a 29.9 percent increase. Year-on-year growth in imports was especially strong from a number of countries-Ecuador (123.9%), Thailand (72.1%), Korea (52.6%), and China (36.9%).\n\nChile's approach to foreign direct investment is codified in the country's Foreign Investment Law. Registration is reported to be simple and transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital.\nThe Chilean Government has formed a Council on Innovation and Competition, hoping to bring in additional FDI to new parts of the economy.\n\nStandard & Poor's gives Chile a credit rating of AA-.  The Government of Chile continues to pay down its foreign debt, with public debt only 3.9 percent of GDP at the end of 2006. The Chilean central government is a net creditor with a net asset position of 7% of GDP at end 2012. The current account deficit was 4% in the first quarter of 2013, financed mostly by foreign direct investment. 14% of central government revenue came directly from copper in 2012.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTransport\n\nDue to Chile's topography a functioning transport network is vital to its economy. Buses are now the main means of long distance transportation in Chile, following the decline of its railway network.  The bus system covers the entire country, from Arica to Santiago (a 30-hour journey) and from Santiago to Punta Arenas (about 40 hours, with a change at Osorno).\n\nChile has a total of 372 runways (62 paved and 310 unpaved). Important airports in Chile include Chacalluta International Airport (Arica), Diego Aracena International Airport (Iquique), Cerro Moreno International Airport (Antofagasta), Carriel Sur International Airport (Concepción), El Tepual International Airport (Puerto Montt), Presidente Carlos Ibáñez del Campo International Airport (Punta Arenas), Mataveri International Airport (Easter Island), the most remote airport in the world, and the Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport (Santiago) with a traffic of 12,105,524 passengers in 2011. Santiago is headquarters of Latin America's largest airline holding company and Chilean flag carrier LAN Airlines.\n\nTelecommunications\n\nChile has a telecommunication system which covers much of the country, including Chilean insular and Antarctic bases. Privatization of the telephone system began in 1988; Chile has one of the most advanced telecommunications infrastructure in South America with a modern system based on extensive microwave radio relay facilities and domestic satellite system with 3 earth stations. In 2012, there were 3.276 million main lines in use and 24.13 million mobile cellular telephone subscribers. According to a 2012 database of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), 61.42% of the Chilean population uses the internet, making Chile the country with the highest internet penetration in South America.[http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/statistics/2013/Individuals_Internet_2000-2012.xls \"Percentage of Individuals using the Internet 2000], International Telecommunications Union (Geneva), June 2013, retrieved 22 June 2013 The Chilean internet country code is \".cl\".\n\nWater supply and sanitation \n\nWater supply and sanitation sector is characterized by high levels of access and good service quality. Compared to most other countries, Chile's water and sanitation sector \ndistinguishes itself by the fact that all urban water companies are privately owned or operated. The sector also prides itself of having a \nmodern and effective regulatory framework, including an innovative \nsubsidy to water demand by the poor. One weakness of the sector is the \nrelatively high water losses.\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture in Chile encompasses a wide range of different activities due to its particular geography, climate and geology and human factors. Historically agriculture is one of the bases of Chile's economy, now agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounts only for 4.9% of the GDP  and employed 13.6% of the country's labor force. Some major agriculture products of Chile includes grapes, apples, pears, onions, wheat, corn, oats, peaches, garlic, asparagus, beans, beef, poultry, wool, fish and timber.[1] Due to its geographical isolation and strict customs policies Chile is free from diseases such as Mad Cow Disease, fruit fly and Phylloxera. This, plus being located in the Southern Hemisphere which has quite different harvesting times from the Northern Hemisphere, and its wide range of agriculture conditions are considered Chile's main comparative advantages. However, Chile's mountainous landscape limits the extent and intensity of agriculture so that arable land corresponds only to 2.62% of the total territory.\n\nTourism\n\nTourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades. In 2005, tourism grew by 13.6 percent, generating more than 4.5 billion dollars of which 1.5 billion was attributed to foreign tourists. According to the National Service of Tourism (Sernatur), 2 million people a year visit the country. Most of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent, mainly Argentina; followed by a growing number from the United States, Europe, and Brazil with a growing number of Asians from South Korea and PR China. \n\nThe main attractions for tourists are places of natural beauty situated in the extreme zones of the country: San Pedro de Atacama, in the north, is very popular with foreign tourists who arrive to admire the Incaic architecture, the altiplano lakes, and the Valley of the Moon. In Putre, also in the north, there is the Chungará Lake, as well as the Parinacota and the Pomerape volcanoes, with altitudes of 6,348 m and 6,282 m, respectively. Throughout the central Andes there are many ski resorts of international repute, including Portillo, Valle Nevado and Termas de Chillán.\n\nThe main tourist sites in the south are national parks (the most popular is Conguillío National Park in the Araucanía) and the coastal area around Tirúa and Cañete with the Isla Mocha and the Nahuelbuta National Park, Chiloé Archipelago and Patagonia, which includes Laguna San Rafael National Park, with its many glaciers, and the Torres del Paine National Park. The central port city of Valparaíso, which is World Heritage with its unique architecture, is also popular. Finally, Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean is one of the main Chilean tourist destinations.\n\nFor locals, tourism is concentrated mostly in the summer (December to March), and mainly in the coastal beach towns. Arica, Iquique, Antofagasta, La Serena and Coquimbo are the main summer centers in the north, and Pucón on the shores of Lake Villarrica is the main center in the south. Because of its proximity to Santiago, the coast of the Valparaíso Region, with its many beach resorts, receives the largest number of tourists. Viña del Mar, Valparaíso's northern affluent neighbor, is popular because of its beaches, casino, and its annual song festival, the most important musical event in Latin America. Pichilemu in the O'Higgins Region is widely known as South America's \"best surfing spot\" according to Fodor's.\n\nIn November 2005 the government launched a campaign under the brand \"Chile: All Ways Surprising\" intended to promote the country internationally for both business and tourism.  Museums in Chile such as the Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts built in 1880, feature works by Chilean artists.\n\nEducation\n\nIn Chile, education begins with preschool until the age of 5. Primary school is provided for children between ages 6 and 13. Students then attend secondary school until graduation at age 17.\n\nSecondary education is divided into two parts: During the first two years, students receive a general education. Then, they choose a branch: scientific humanistic education, artistic education, or technical and professional education. Secondary school ends two years later on the acquirement of a certificate (licencia de enseñanza media). \n\nChilean education is segregated by wealth in a three-tiered system — the quality of the schools reflect socioeconomic backgrounds:\n* city schools (colegios municipales) that are mostly free and have the worse education results, mostly attended by poor students;\n* subsidized schools that receive some money from the government which can be supplemented by fees paid by the student's family, which are attended by mid-income students and typically get mid-level results; and \n* entirely private schools that consistently get the best results. Many private schools charge attendance fees of 0,5 to 1 median household incomes. \n\nHigher education\n\nUpon successful graduation of secondary school, students may continue into higher education. The higher education schools in Chile consist of Chilean Traditional Universities and are divided into public universities or private universities. There are medical schools and both the Universidad de Chile and Universidad Diego Portales offer law schools in a partnership with Yale University. \n\nHealth\n\nThe Ministry of Health (Minsal) is the cabinet-level administrative office in charge of planning, directing, coordinating, executing, controlling and informing the public health policies formulated by the President of Chile. The National Health Fund (Fonasa), created in 1979, is the financial entity entrusted to collect, manage and distribute state funds for health in Chile. It is funded by the public. All employees pay 7 percent of their monthly income to the fund.\n\nFonasa is part of the NHSS and has executive power through the Ministry of Health (Chile). Its headquarters are in Santiago and decentralized public service is conducted by various Regional Offices. More than 12 million beneficiaries benefit from Fonasa. Beneficiaries can also opt for more costly private insurance through Isapre. Hospitals in Chile are mainly located in the Santiago Metropolitan Region.\n\nCulture\n\nFrom the period between early agricultural settlements and up to the late pre-Hispanic period, northern Chile was a region of Andean culture that was influenced by altiplano traditions spreading to the coastal valleys of the north, while southern regions were areas of Mapuche cultural activities. Throughout the colonial period following the conquest, and during the early Republican period, the country's culture was dominated by the Spanish. Other European influences, primarily English, French, and German began in the 19th century and have continued to this day. German migrants influenced the Bavarian style rural architecture and cuisine in the south of Chile in cities such as Valdivia, Frutillar, Puerto Varas, Osorno, Temuco, Puerto Octay, Llanquihue, Faja Maisan, Pitrufquén, Victoria, Pucón and Puerto Montt.    \n\nMusic and dance\n\nMusic in Chile ranges from folkloric, popular and classical music. Its large geography generates different musical styles in the north, center and south of the country, including also Easter Island and Mapuche music.  The national dance is the cueca. Another form of traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the tonada. Arising from music imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1970 appears a rebirth in folk music leading by groups such as Los de Ramón, Los Cuatro Huasos and Los Huasos Quincheros, among others  with composers such as Raúl de Ramón, Violeta Parra and others. In the mid-1960s native musical forms were revitalized by the Parra family with the Nueva canción Chilena, which was associated with political activists and reformers such as Víctor Jara, Inti-Illimani, and Quilapayún. Other important folk singer and researcher on folklore and Chilean ethnography, is Margot Loyola. Also many Chilean rock bands like Los Jaivas, Los Prisioneros, La Ley, and Los Tres have reached international success. In February, annual music festivals are held in Viña del Mar. \n\nLiterature\n\nChileans call their country país de poetas — country of poets.   Gabriela Mistral was the first Latin American to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature (1945). Chile's most famous poet is Pablo Neruda, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature (1971) and is world-renowned for his extensive library of works on romance, nature, and politics. His three highly personalized homes in Isla Negra, Santiago and Valparaíso are popular tourist destinations.\n\nAmong the list of other Chilean poets are Carlos Pezoa Véliz, Vicente Huidobro, Gonzalo Rojas, Pablo de Rokha, Nicanor Parra and Raúl Zurita. Isabel Allende is the best-selling Chilean novelist, with 51 millions of her novels sold worldwide.  Novelist José Donoso's novel The Obscene Bird of Night is considered by critic Harold Bloom to be one of the canonical works of 20th-century Western literature. Another internationally recognized Chilean novelist and poet is Roberto Bolaño whose translations into English have had an excellent reception from the critics.   \n\nCuisine\n\n Chilean cuisine is a reflection of the country's topographical variety, featuring an assortment of seafood, beef, fruits, and vegetables. Traditional recipes include asado, cazuela, empanadas, humitas, pastel de choclo, pastel de papas, curanto and sopaipillas.  Crudos is an example of the mixture of culinary contributions from the various ethnic influences in Chile. The raw minced llama, heavy use of shellfish and rice bread were taken from native Quechua Andean cuisine, (although now beef brought to Chile by Europeans is also used in place of the llama meat), lemon and onions were brought by the Spanish colonists, and the use of mayonnaise and yogurt was introduced by German immigrants, as was beer.\n\nFolklore\n\nThe folklore of Chile, cultural and demographic characteristics of the country, is the result of mixture of Spanish and Amerindian elements that occurred during the colonial period.. Due to cultural and historical reasons, they are classified and distinguished four major areas in the country: Northern Areas, central, southern and south. Most of the traditions of the culture of Chile have a festive purpose, but some, such as dances and ceremonies have religious components.\n\nMythology\n\nChilean mythology, is the mythology and beliefs of the Folklore of Chile.\n\nThis includes Chilote mythology, Rapa Nui mythology and Mapuche mythology.\n\nCinema\n\nThe film originated in Valparaíso on 26 May 1902 with the premiere of the documentary Exercise General Fire Brigade, the first film completely filmed and processed in the country. In the following decades, marked milestones The deck of Death (or The Enigma of Lord Street) (1916), considered the first film Chilean story, 'The transmission of presidential (1920), the first animated film in the country, and North and South (1934), the first sound film of Chile.\n\nSports\n\nChile's most popular sport is association football. Chile has appeared in nine FIFA World Cups which includes hosting the 1962 FIFA World Cup where the national football team finished third. Other results achieved by the national football team include five finals and one title at the Copa América, one silver and two bronze medals at the Pan American Games, a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics and two third places finishes in the FIFA under-17 and under-20 youth tournaments. The top league in the Chilean football league system is the Chilean Primera División, which is named by the IFFHS as the ninth strongest national football league in the world.\n\nThe main football clubs are Colo-Colo, Universidad de Chile and Universidad Católica. Colo-Colo is the country's most successful football club, having both the most national and international championships, including the coveted Copa Libertadores South American club tournament. Universidad de Chile was the last international champion (Copa Sudamericana 2011).\n\nTennis is Chile's most successful sport. Its national team won the World Team Cup clay tournament twice (2003 & 2004), and played the Davis Cup final against Italy in 1976. At the 2004 Summer Olympics the country captured gold and bronze in men's singles and gold in men's doubles. Marcelo Ríos became the first Latin American man to reach the number one spot in the ATP singles rankings in 1998. Anita Lizana won the US Open in 1937, becoming the first woman from Latin America to win a Grand Slam tournament. Luis Ayala was twice a runner-up at the French Open and both Ríos and Fernando González reached the Australian Open men's singles finals. González also won a silver medal in singles at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAt the Summer Olympic Games Chile boasts a total of two gold medals (tennis), seven silver medals (athletics, equestrian, boxing, shooting and tennis) and four bronze medals (tennis, boxing and football). In 2012, Chile won its first Paralympic Games medal (gold in Athletics).\n\nRodeo is the country's national sport and is practiced in the more rural areas of the nation. A sport similar to hockey called chueca was played by the Mapuche people during the Spanish conquest. Skiing and snowboarding are practiced at ski centers located in the Central Andes, and in southern ski centers near to cities as Osorno, Puerto Varas, Temuco and Punta Arenas. surfing is popular at some coastal towns. Polo is professionally practiced within Chile, with the country achieving top prize in the 2008 and 2015 World Polo Championship.\n\nBasketball is a popular sport in which Chile has earned a bronze medal in the first men's FIBA World Championship held in 1950 and winning a second bronze medal when Chile hosted the 1959 FIBA World Championship. Chile hosted the first FIBA World Championship for Women in 1953 finishing the tournament with the silver medal. San Pedro de Atacama is host to the annual \"Atacama Crossing\", a six-stage, 250 km footrace which annually attracts about 150 competitors from 35 countries. The Dakar Rally off-road automobilie race has been held in both Chile and Argentina since 2009.\n\nCultural heritage\n\nThe cultural heritage of Chile consists, first, of their intangible heritage, composed of various cultural events, such as visual arts, crafts, dances, holidays, cuisine, games, music and traditions, and, secondly, by its tangible, consists of those buildings, objects and sites of archaeological, architectural, traditional, artistic, ethnographic, folkloric, historical, religious or technological scattered through Chilean territory, among them, those goods are declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage of 1972, ratified by Chile in 1980. These cultural sites are the Rapa Nui National Park (1995), the Churches of Chiloé (2000), the historical district of the port city of Valparaíso (2003), Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works (2005) and the mining city Sewell (2006).\n\nIn 1999 the Cultural Heritage Day was established as a way to honour and commemorate Chiles cultural heritage.

This day is one of the most popular for shrine visits, and many pray for inner renewal, health, and prosperity.  PBS Multifaith Calendar\nUpcoming events\nJanuary 1 of every year\nSolemnity of Mary, the Mother of God\nReligion/Culture: Catholic\nEight days after the feast of the birth of Christ, we remember the Blessed Virgin Mary by celebrating her divine motherhood. As the Mother of God, Mary is known as Theotokos, which means the \"God-Bearer\". It is fitting to honor Mary as Mother of Jesus, following the birth of Christ. When Catholics celebrate the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, we are not only honoring Mary, who was chosen among all women throughout history to bear God incarnate, but we are also honoring our Lord, who is fully God and fully human. Calling Mary \"Mother of God\" is the highest honor we can give her. It is a Holy Day of Obligation for Catholics, who should attend Mass on this day.\nUpcoming events\nJanuary 1 of every year\nEpiphany/Three Kings Day\nReligion/Culture: Christian\nIn western Christian tradition, January 6 is celebrated as Epiphany. It goes by other names in various church traditions. In Hispanic and Latin culture, as well as some places in Europe, it is known as Three Kings' Day (Span: el Dia de los Tres Reyes, la Fiesta de Reyes, or el Dia de los Reyes Magos; Dutch: Driekoningendag). It is a day in which we celebrate the three wise men coming to visit Jesus. They brought Him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. In Latin America this day we celebrate by bringing gifts to family and friends. Epiphany is the climax of the Advent/Christmas season and the Twelve Days of Christmas, which are usually counted from the evening of December 25th until the morning of January 6th, which is the Twelfth Day. In following this older custom of counting the days beginning at sundown, the evening of January 5th is the Twelfth Night. This is an occasion for feasting in some cultures, including the baking of a special King's Cake as part of the festivities of Epiphany (a King's Cake is part of the observance of Mardi Gras in French Catholic culture of the Southern USA).   More information\nUpcoming events\nJanuary 6 of every year\nRussian Orthodox Christmas\nReligion/Culture: Eastern Christian\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union, January 7th has become an official national holiday. This is the date of the Russian Orthodox Christmas; Nativity of Christ; celebration. Many Orthodox Christian traditions have adopted December 25th for their Nativity or Christmas celebration which culminates with the observance of Theophany (Feast of the Manifestation), the Baptism of Our Lord, on January 6th; January 20th on the old calendar.  More information\nUpcoming events\nJanuary 7 of every year\nMakar Sankranti\nReligion/Culture: Hindu\nMakar Sankranti is one of the most auspicious days for the Hindus, and is celebrated in almost all parts of the country in myriad cultural forms, with great devotion, fervor and gaiety. The festival of Makar Sankranti traditionally coincides with the beginning of the sun's northward journey (the Uttarayan) when it enters the sign of Makr (the Capricorn). It falls on the 14th of January every year according to the solar calendar.\nUpcoming events\nJanuary 14 of every year\nMartin Luther King Day\nReligion/Culture: National Observance\nThe Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gained national prominence during the Montgomery, Alabama bus boycott of 1955–1956 and soon became the acknowledged national leader of the growing movement to obtain civil rights for African Americans. His commitment to nonviolence, his courage, and the moral power of his vision, eloquently expressed in masterful oratory and writings, won him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Toward the end of his life King became convinced of the interrelatedness of all forms of social, economic, and military oppression, and broadened the sphere of his activism. He spoke out against U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam and was preparing to lead a massive Poor People's March on Washington when he was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968, while helping to organize the city’s sanitation workers. Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday is observed nationally on the third Monday in January.\nUpcoming events\nLunar New Year\nReligion/Culture: China and other Asian Countries\nThis is the beginning of a three-day celebration of the Chinese New Year, although traditionally the New Year celebration extends for fifteen days until the Lantern Festival. The festivities mark the beginning of year 4709 (The Year of the Rabbit) since the mythical founding of the Chinese people. On New Year's Eve, the Kitchen God returns from heaven to the shrine prepared by each family, where he is welcomed back with firecrackers and offerings. New Year's Day is a day when all business accounts are settled and grudges forgotten. Traditional Chinese celebrate New Year's Day as a birthday and count themselves one year older. The Chinese celebrate by eating noodles to signify a long life and pork dumplings called jiao zi, which means \"midnight\" or \"the end and the beginning of time.\" A Chinese coin is hidden in one of the dumplings, and the person who finds it will have good luck over the coming year.

Woodson and the organization he founded, the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH), conceived and announced Negro History Week in 1925. The event was the first celebrated during a week in February 1926 that encompassed the birthdays of both Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. The response was overwhelming: Black history clubs sprang up; teachers demanded materials to instruct their pupils; and progressive whites, not simply scholars and philanthropists, stepped forward to endorse the effort. By the time of Woodson's death in 1950, Negro History Week had become a central part of African American life and substantial progress had been made by bringing more Americans to appreciate the celebration.\nAt mid-century, mayors of cities nationwide issued proclamations noting Negro History Week. The Black Awakening of the 1960s dramatically expanded the consciousness of African Americans about the importance of black history, and the Civil Rights movement focused Americans of all color on the subject of the contributions of African Americans to our history and culture.\nThe celebration was expanded to a month in 1976, the nation's bicentennial. President Gerald R. Ford urged Americans to \"seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.\" That year, fifty years after the first celebration, the association held the first African American History Month. By this time, the entire nation had come to recognize the importance of Black history in the drama of the American story. Since then each American president has issued African American Heritage Month proclamations.\nUpcoming events\nImbolc\nReligion/Culture: Wiccan\nImbolc, which like all Wiccan holidays begins at sundown on the day before, is a celebration of fire and light and the return of life.  Wicca is the common term for many different traditions of Neo-Pagan nature religions that celebrate seasonal and life cycles. Originating as agricultural festivals going back for thousands of years, many Sabbat practices were incorporated into Roman, Greek, and other traditions and also found their way into subsequent Western religions. Pagans and Wiccans are not anti-Christ or in opposition to any religion. Their beliefs and practices focus on the earth's seasons and the natural cycles of the world. They stress reverence for nature and belief in ecological principles. As such, Pagans and Wiccans are largely pacifist in nature. Their only \"rule\" is to \"harm none.\" Pagans and Wiccans believe that the divine is in everything, and that there are multiple deities and many different pathways to the divine. They also believe in reincarnation. The circle with five points, the \"Pentacle,\" is the most common symbol used in Wicca. Its five points symbolize Air, Fire, Water, Earth, and Spirit, in the circle of eternity. Countries with large Wiccan populations include the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Holland.\nUpcoming events\nTu B'shvat\nReligion/Culture: Judaism\nOn Tu B'Shevat we celebrate a New Year for the Trees, rejoicing in the fruit of the tree and the fruit of the vine, celebrating the splendid, abundant gifts of the natural world which give our senses delight and our bodies life.\nTu B'Shevat marks the beginning of spring in Israel. Sustaining rains are at the peak of their power and the world responds, brimming with buds of fragrant life. To mark this moment, school children plant trees. Often these trees have been provided by the contributions of Jewish students abroad through the good offices of the Jewish National Fund.\nFor Jews outside of Israel, Tu B'Shevat is a celebration of the renewal of vision and awareness, a celebration of connections and connectedness--to our own inner-selves, to the social world of human beings, and to the natural world and its Source.  More information\nRecognizing the Holiday/Festival: Common practice is planting trees.\nUpcoming events\nAsh Wednesday\nReligion/Culture: Christian\nThis marks the beginning of Lent, a 40-day period of prayer and fasting preceding Easter Sunday. It is observed in memory of Jesus' 40 days of fasting in the desert. In the early centuries of Christianity, there were strict requirements for fasting during the period of preparation for Easter. Although these rules have been relaxed in the Western church, many Roman Catholics and Protestants choose to give up a favorite food or activity during Lent. There are many symbolic meanings to the use of ashes on this holiday. Generally, ashes symbolize death. The priest or minister's placing of ashes on one's forehead in the shape of a cross is part of the preparation for fasting and resistance to temptation by those observing Lent that ends in the symbolic renewal of life on Easter. The word Lent comes from Middle English lenten or lente, from the Old English lencten or lengten, meaning spring, the time of year when the days begin to lengthen.\nRecognizing the Festival/Holiday: Before inviting someone to lunch or hosting a meal, check to see whether invitee is observing a special diet for this period.\nCheck with the Office for Institutional Equity and Compliance for  accommodation recommendations .\nUpcoming events\nWomen's History Month\nReligion/Culture: National Celebration\nThis month pays tribute to the generations of women whose commitment to nature and the planet have proved invaluable to society. The celebration was met with positive response, and schools began to host their own Women's History Week programs. The next year, leaders from the California group share their project at a Women's History Institute at Sarah Lawrence College. Other participants not only became determined to begin their own local Women's History Week projects but also agreed to support an effort to have Congress declare a national Women's History Week.\nIn 1981, Sen. Oran Hatch (R-UT) and Rep. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) cosponsored the first Joint Congressional Resolution proclaiming a \"Women's History Week.\" In 1987, the National Women's History Project petitioned Congress to expand the celebration to the entire month of March. Since then, the National Women's History Month Resolution has been approved every year with bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.\nUpcoming events\nNational Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month\nReligion/Culture: National observance\nMarch is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month thanks to a 1987 Presidential Proclamation which was the direct result of the advocacy efforts of The Arc.  A lot has changed since then: more people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) are living and thriving in their communities rather than institutions, there are more opportunities in education and employment, more protections in health care, the legal system and other areas of human rights, there are more positive and accurate portrayals of people with I/DD in the arts, the list goes on. But we must remember that many of those advancements were hard won. Self-advocacy and advocacy on behalf of those with I/DD was the impetus for many of the positive changes in our society, such as the proclamation that recognized DD Awareness Month.  More information\nUpcoming events\nIrish American Heritage Month\nReligion/Culture: Irish American\nMarch is designated as Irish American Heritage Month to recognize the contribution that Irish immigrants and their descendants have played in the formation of our Nation.

Newly harvested grains, coconuts, and sweets are thrown into the fire as offerings, followed by singing and dancing around the bonfire. When the fire dies down, water is splashed on the embers, and everyone applies the ash to their forehead. Some of the ash is kept in the home to apply to children's foreheads to protect them against evil throughout the year.

Tartan is the most recognizable pattern associated with Scotland - it is a textile of interwoven vertical and horizontal lines that can be seen on kilts, skirts, and other clothing. The Senate passed a resolution in 1998 to designate April 6 as National Tartan Day, reading in part: \"Whereas this resolution honors the major role that Scottish Americans played in the founding of this nation, such as the fact that almost half of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were of Scottish descent, the governors in nine of the original 13 States were of Scottish ancestry, Scottish Americans successfully helped shape this country in its formative years and guide this nation through its most troubled times.\" In 2005, the House passed a similar resolution; and in 2008, President George Bush signed a Presidential Proclamation making April 6th National Tartan Day. Americans of Scottish descent have made enduring contributions to our Nation with their hard work, faith and values. On National Tartan Day, we celebrate the spirit and character of Scottish Americans and recognize their many contributions to our culture and our way of life.\nScotland and the United States have long shared ties of family and friendship, and many of our country's most cherished customs and ideals first grew to maturity on Scotland's soil. The Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish Declaration of Independence signed in 1320, embodied the Scots' strong dedication to liberty, and the Scots brought that tradition of freedom with them to the New World. Sons and daughters of many Scottish clans were among the first immigrants to settle in America, and their determination and optimism helped build our Nation's character. Several of our Founding Fathers were of Scottish descent, as have been many Presidents and Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Many Scottish Americans, such as Andrew Carnegie, were great philanthropists, founding and supporting numerous scientific, educational and civic institutions. From the evocative sounds of the bagpipes to the great sport of golf, the Scots have also left an indelible mark on American culture.\nUpcoming Events\nApril 6th of every year\nTriduum\nReligion/Culture: Catholicism\nThe Triduum is the three-day celebration of the death and resurrection of Christ - Holy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Vigil/Easter Sunday. \"Holy Thursday- Celebrated by a reenactment of the last supper at an evening mass.

The Paschal Triduum begins on the evening of Holy Thursday and concludes with the Evening Prayer (Vespers) of Easter.  More information\nPassover\nReligion/Culture: Judaism\nThis holiday, which is observed for eight days, celebrates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Moses, an Israelite born into slavery, raised in the Pharaoh's household, and later banished as a young man for defending his people, returned to Egypt and confronted the Pharaoh in the name of God, demanding freedom for his people. The Pharaoh capitulated only after God sent ten plagues, the last of which killed the first son of every Egyptian family, including that of the Pharaoh. The Israelites marked their doors to identify their homes for the angel of death, who passed over and spared them. Moses then led the Israelites through the desert for 40 years until they reached Palestine. The celebration of Passover, a spring festival commemorating freedom and new life, begins the previous evening with a Seder, a meal during which the story of Passover is read from the Haggadah. The menu includes a number of traditional foods such as matzoh, or unleavened bread, which recalls the unleavened bread eaten by the Israelites in the desert.\nRecognizing the Festival/Holiday: For the eight days of Passover, Jews observing the holiday abstain from eating any foods containing leavening components, such as bread, cake, and donuts.

This victory marked the end of a three-year period of religious persecution, restored Jewish independence, and ensured the survival of monotheism (belief in one God). According to legend, when the Jews returned to cleanse their Temple, which had been defiled by pagan worship, they discovered only enough consecrated oil to keep the holy lamp burning for one day. However, the oil miraculously lasted eight days, the time needed to secure a new supply. Hanukkah is celebrated by lighting a candle on each of the eight days of celebration. On the first night, one candle is lit in a branched candlestick called a menorah, and an additional candle is lit each night until the eighth night.

During the month of November, we honor the heritage and contributions of American Indians.\nAsian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month\nDuring the month of May, we honor the heritage and contributions of Asian American, Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians. The month of May was chosen to commemorate the immigration of the first Japanese to the United State on May 7, 1843, and to mark the anniversary of the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869.\nBlack History Month\nDuring the month of February, CHOP celebrates black history month with a variety of programming. This annual observance began in 1926 by historian Carter G. Woodson and serves as a remembrance of important African Americans and events in the history of this culture.\nDisability Employment Awareness Month\nReflecting the important role disability plays in workforce diversity in October, National Disability Employment Awareness Month celebrates the contributions of workers with disabilities and educates about the value of a diverse workforce inclusive of their skills and talents.\nHispanic Heritage Month\nDuring National Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15 to October 15) we recognize the contributions made and the important presence of Hispanic and Latino Americans to the United States and celebrate the group's heritage and culture. Hispanic Heritage Month, whose roots go back to 1968, begins each year on September 15, the anniversary of independence of five Latin American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Mexico, Chile and Belize also celebrate their independence days during this period and Columbus Day (Día de la Raza) is October 12.\nLGBT Pride Month\nLGBT Pride Month is celebrated each June to commemorate the Stonewall Riots in 1969, a turning point in the gay rights movement and the fight to advance equality for LGBT identifying Americans.\nMLK Day of Service"

                "Vermilion (sometimes spelled vermillion  ) is a brilliant red or scarlet pigment originally made from the powdered mineral cinnabar, and is also the name of the resulting color.   It was widely used in the art and decoration of Ancient Rome, in the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages, in the paintings of the Renaissance, as sindoor in India, and in the art and lacquerware of China. \n\nIn art and culture\n\nFile:Villa of Mysteries (Pompeii)-20.jpg|The bright vermilion murals in the Villa of Mysteries in Pompeii  (before 79 AD) were painted with ground and powdered cinnabar, the most expensive red pigment of the time.\nFile:Masaccio, pala colonna, santi girolamo e giovanni battista.jpg|The painting of Saint Jerome by Masaccio (1428–29) featured a vivid robe painted with vermilion. \nFile:Girart de Roussillon (full page).jpg|A page of the Roman de Girart de Roussillon (1450). Both vermilion and minium, or red lead, were used in Medieval manuscripts. Vermilion, as expensive as gilding, was usually reserved for the most important illustrations or designs.\nFile:Tizian 041.jpg|The Venetian painter Titian used vermilion for dramatic effect. In the Assumption of the Virgin (1516–18) the vermilion robes draw the eye to the main characters.\nFile:Lacquerware-roundbox-w-children.jpg | A \"Chinese red\" lacquerware roundbox from the Qing dynasty (1736-1795), from the National Museum of China in Beijing.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word vermilion came from the Old French word vermeillon, which was derived from vermeil, from the Latin vermiculus, the diminutive of the Latin word vermis, or worm. It has the same origin as the English word vermin.  The name originated because it had a similar color to the natural red dye made from an insect, the Kermes vermilio, which was widely used in Europe.   The words for the color in Portuguese (vermelho), Galician (vermello) and Catalan (vermell) have the same origin. The first recorded use of vermilion as a color name in English was in 1289.   The term cinnabar was used interchangeably with vermilion until the 17th century, when vermilion became the more common name. By the late 18th century 'cinnabar' applied to the unground natural mineral only.\n\nChemistry and manufacture\n\nVermilion is a dense, opaque pigment with a clear, brilliant hue.  The pigment was originally made by grinding a powder of cinnabar, the ore which contains mercury. The chemical formula of the pigment is HgS (mercury(II) sulfide); like most mercury compounds it is toxic.\n\nVermilion is not one specific hue; Mercuric sulfides make a range of warm hues – from bright orange-red to a duller bluish-red. Differences in hue are caused by the size of the ground particles of pigment. Larger crystals produce duller and less-orange hue.\n\nCinnabar pigment was a side-product of the mining of mercury, and mining cinnabar was difficult, expensive and dangerous, because of the toxicity of mercury.  The Greek philosopher Theophrastus of Eresus (371-286 BC) described the process  in  \"De Lapidibus\", the first scientific book on minerals. Efforts began early to find a better way to make the pigment.\n\nThe Chinese were probably the first to make a synthetic vermilion as early as the 4th century BC. The Greek alchemist Zosimus of Panopolis (Third–Fourth century AD) wrote that such a method existed. In the early ninth century the process was accurately described by the Arab or Persian alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (722–804) in his book of recipes of colors, and the process began to be widely used in Europe. \n\nThe process described by Jabir ibn Hayyan was fairly simple. Mercury and sulfur were mixed together, forming a black compound of sulphide of mercury, called Aethiopes mineralis. This was then heated in a flask. The compound vaporized, and recondensed in the top of the flask. The flask was broken, the vermilion was taken out, and it was ground. When first created the pigment was almost black, but as it was ground the red color appeared. The longer the color was ground, the finer the color became. The Italian Renaissance artist Cennino Cennini wrote: \"if you were to grind it every day even for twenty years it would keep getting better and more perfect.\" \n\nDuring the 17th century a new method of making the pigment was introduced, known as the 'Dutch' method. Mercury and melted sulfur were mashed to make black mercury sulfide, then heated in retort, producing vapors condensing as a bright, red mercury sulfide. To remove the sulfur these crystals were treated with a strong alkali, washed and finally ground under water to yield the commercial powder form of pigment.   The pigment is still made today by essentially the same process.\n\nVermilion has one important defect; it is liable to darken, or develop a purplish-gray surface sheen. Cennino Cennini wrote, \"Bear in mind...that it is not in its character to be exposed to air but it is more resistant on panel than on walls since, when it is used and laid on a wall, over a period of time, standing in the air, it turns black\"   The darkness is not a result of the vermilion itself, which is very stable, but is caused by impurities and adulteration of the pigment.  Newer research indicates that chlorine ions and light may aid in decomposing vermilion into elemental mercury, which is black in finely dispersed form. \n\nVermilion was the primary red pigment used by European painters from the Renaissance until the 20th century. However, because of its cost and toxicity, it was almost entirely replaced by a new synthetic pigment, cadmium red, in the 20th century.\n\nGenuine vermilion pigment today comes mostly from China; it is a synthetic mercuric sulfide, labeled on paint tubes as PR-106 (Red Pigment 106). The synthetic pigment is of higher quality than vermilion made from ground cinnabar, which has many impurities. The pigment is very toxic, and should be used with great care. \n\nFile:Cinnabar-172403.jpg|Cinnabar crystals from the Almaden Mine in northern California.\nFile:Cinnabar-3d6b.jpg|Cinnabar crystals on dolomite from Tongren Prefecture, Guizhou, China.\nFile:Paolo Uccello 035.jpg|Vermilion has the defect of darkening with time.

Cinnabar was mined in Spain beginning in about 5300 BC. In China, the first documented use of Cinnabar as a pigment was by the Yangshao culture (5000–4000 BC), where it was used to paint ceramics, to cover the walls and floors of rooms, and for ritual ceremonies. \n\nThe principal source of cinnabar for the ancient Romans was the Almaden mine in northwest Spain, which was worked by prisoners. Since the ore of mercury was highly toxic, a term in the mines was a virtual death sentence. Pliny the Elder described the mines this way:\n\nNothing is more carefully guarded. It is forbidden to break up or refine the cinnabar on the spot. They send it to Rome in its natural condition, under seal, to the extent of some ten thousand pounds a year. The sales price is fixed by law to keep it from becoming impossibly expensive, and the price fixed is seventy sesterces a pound. \n\nIn Rome, the precious pigment was used to paint frescoes, decorate statues, and even as a cosmetic. In Roman triumphs, the victors had their faces covered with vermilion power, and the face of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill was also colored vermilion. Cinnabar was used to paint the walls of some of the most luxurious villas in Pompeii, including the Villa of the Mysteries. Pliny reported that the painters of that villa stole a large portion of the expensive pigment by frequently washing their brushes and saving the wash water. \n\nIn the Byzantine Empire, the use of cinnabar and the vermilion color was reserved for the use of the Imperial family and administrators; official letters and imperial decrees were written in vermilion ink, made with cinnabar.\n\nIn the Americas\n\nVermilion was also used by the peoples of Central and South America, to paint ceramics, figurines, murals, and for the decoration of burials. It was used in the Chavin Civilization (400 BC – 200 AD), and in the Maya, Sican, Moche, and Inca Empire. The major source was the Huancavelica mine in the Andes mountains in central Peru.\n\nThe most dramatic example of the use of vermilion in the Americas was the so-called Tomb of the Red Queen, located in Temple XIII in the ruins of the Mayan city of Palenque in Chiapas, Mexico, dated to between 600–700 AD, discovered in 1994 by Mexican archeologist Arnoldo Gonzales Cruz. The body and all the objects in the sarcophagus were covered with bright red vermilion powder made from cinnabar. \n\nIn the Middle Ages and Renaissance\n\nThe technique for making a synthetic vermilion by combining sulphur and mercury was in use in Europe in the 9th century, but the pigment was still expensive. Since it was almost as expensive as gold leaf, it was used only in the most important decoration of illuminated manuscripts, while the less expensive minium, made with red lead, was used for the red letters and symbols in the text.\n\nVermilion was also used by painters in the Renaissance as a very vivid and bright red, though it did have the weakness of sometimes turning dark with time. The Florentine artist Cennino Cennini described it in his famous handbook for artists:\n\nthis pigment is made by alchemy, prepared in a retort, which subject I will leave be since to put every method and recipe into my discussion would be too longwinded. The reason? Because if you care to take the trouble you will find a lot of recipes for it, and particularly if you cultivate friendships with monks. But, so that you do not waste your time with the many different techniques, I advise you, just take what you can find at the apothecary's for your money. And I want to teach you how to buy it and how to recognise the good vermilion. Always buy solid vermilion and not crushed or ground. The reason? Because more often than not you are cheated either with red lead or crushed brick. \n\nBy the 20th century, the cost and toxicity of vermilion led to its gradually being replaced by synthetic pigments, particularly cadmium red, which had a comparable color and opacity.\n\nChinese Red\n\nFile:Lacquerware bowl, Western Han Dynasty.JPG |A lacquerware bowl from the Western Han Dynasty, 2nd century BC (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York)\nFile:Red lacquer tray, Song Dynasty.jpg | A lacquerware tray  from the Song Dynasty, 960-1279 (Freer and Sackler Galleries, Washington, D.C.)\nFile:Red lacquerware dish, Ming Dynasty.jpg | A lacquerware dish from the Ming Dynasty, late 15th to mid-16th century.

The color was most famously used in creating Chinese lacquerware, which was exported around the world, giving rise to the term \"Chinese red.\"\n\nThe lacquer came from the Chinese lacquer tree, or Toxicodendron vernicifluum, a relative of the sumac tree, which grew in regions of China, Korea and Japan. The sap or resin of the tree, called urushiol, was caustic and toxic (it contained the same chemical compound as poison ivy) but, painted on to wood or metal, it hardened into a  fine natural plastic, or lacquer surface. The pure sap was dark brown, but beginning in about the 3rd century BC, during the Han Dynasty, Chinese artisans colored it with powdered cinnabar or with red ochre (ferric oxide), giving it an orange-red color.    Beginning in about the 8th century,  Chinese chemists began making synthetic vermilion from mercury and sulfur, which reduced the price of the pigment and allowed the production of Chinese lacquerware on a larger scale.\n\nThe shade of red of the lacquerware has changed over the centuries. During the Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) the Chinese word for red referred to a light red. However, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), when the synthetic vermilion was introduced, that color became darker and richer. The poet Bai Juyi (772–846) wrote that \"the flowers in the river when the sun rises are redder than flames\", and the word he used for red was the word for vermilion, or Chinese red. \n\nWhen Chinese lacquerware and the ground cinnabar used to color it were exported to Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, European collectors considered it to be finer than the European vermilion. In 1835 \"Chinese vermilion\" was described as a cinnabar so pure that it only had to be ground into powder to become a perfect vermilion. Historically European vermilion often included adulterants including brick, orpiment, iron oxide, Persian red, iodine scarlet—and minium (red lead), an inexpensive and bright but fugitive lead-oxide pigment. \n\nIn China, From ancient times vermilion was regarded as the color of blood, and thus the color of life. It was used to paint temples, the carriages of the Emperor, and as the printing paste for  personal name chops. It was also used for unique red calligraphic ink reserved for Emperors. Chinese Taoists associated vermilion with eternity.\n\nSindoor\n\nIn India, vermilion, or sindoor as it is called, is the symbol of fertility. It is therefore applied on the forehead as a dot or on the hair parting of the woman signifying that she is married. A key ritual in Indian marriages is application of vermilion by the groom on his bride, signifying their marital bond, which she applies every day for the rest of life till her husband's death.\n\nVariations\n\nRed-orange\n\nAt right is displayed the Crayola color red-orange.\n\nRed-orange has been a Crayola color since 1930.\n\nOrange-red\n\nDisplayed at right is the web color orange-red. It was formulated in 1987 as one of the X11 colors, which became known as the X11 web colors after the invention of the World Wide Web in 1991.\n\nMedium vermilion\n\nAt right is the medium tone of vermilion called \"vermilion\" on the Plochere color list, a color list formulated in 1948 that is used widely by interior designers.\n\nChinese red\n\n\"China red\" or \"Chinese red\" is the name used for the vermilion shade used in Chinese lacquerware. One version is shown in the color box at right;  the shade could vary from dark to light depending upon how the pigment was made and how the lacquer was applied.  Chinese red was originally made from the powdered mineral cinnabar,  but beginning in about the 8th century it was made more commonly by a chemical process combining mercury and sulphur. Vermilion has significance in Taoist culture, and is regarded as the color of life and eternity.\n\nThe first recorded use of Chinese red as a color name in English was in 1924. \n\nThe source of this color is: [http://tx4.us/nbs/nbs-c.htm ISCC-NBS Dictionary of Color Names (1955)--Color Sample of Chinese red (color sample #36)].\n\nIn nature\n\nFile:P rubinus.jpg | The vermilion flycatcher is  a native of Central and South America.\n\nIn human culture\n\n;Hindu culture\n\n* Hindu women use vermilion along the hair parting line known as Sindoor, to signify that they are married. Hindu men often wear vermilion on their forehead during religious ceremonies and festivals.\n\n;Religion\n* The Shaolin temple, where the Buddhist monk Bodhidharma is reputed to have established the new sect of Chan Buddhism (Zen Buddhism), is colored a bright tone of vermilion. This temple was made famous in the West by the 1972–1975 TV series Kung Fu.\n* In the Bible vermilion is listed as a pigment that was in use for painting buildings during the reign of Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah and is named in the book of the prophet Ezekiel as a pigment used in art that portrayed Chaldean men. (Jeremiah 22:11–14, Ezekiel 23:14-17)\n* The Vermilion rose is a symbol of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\n;Mythology\n\n* In Han China's Five Elements cosmology (cf. Chinese mythology), one of the four symbols of the four directions is a bird called Vermilion Bird, which represents the direction of south. The color red (particularly as exemplified by cinnabar/vermilion) was also symbolically associated with summer, fire, a certain note on the musical scale, a certain day of the calendar, and so on. \n\n;Literature\n\n* Vermilion Sands is a collection of science fiction short stories by J.G. Ballard published in 1971 about an imaginary future resort that pleases its guests by using various kinds of futuristic technology.\n\n;History of computing\n\n* The color orange red has a special significance in hacker culture. The documentation for Digital Equipment Corporation's VMS version 4 came in memorable, distinctively colored orangish-reddish ring binders, and \"China red\" was Digital's official name for this color. Mark Crispin seems to claim Digital's name for the color was Terracotta, at least in the context of PDP-10 machines running Tops-20.  \n* Vermilion City is one of the locations used in the English translated versions of the Pokémon games and anime cartoons. It is a port town in the Kanto area and the name is derived from the original Japanese name クチバシティ (Kuchiba City). Kuchiba is an orange-red color associated with sunsets and autumnal leaves and Vermilion was used as an approximate translation.",
                "In color theory, a tint is the mixture of a color with white, which increases lightness, and a shade is the mixture of a color with black, which reduces lightness. A tone is produced either by the mixture of a color with gray, or by both tinting and shading.  Mixing a color with any neutral color (including black, gray and white) reduces the chroma, or colorfulness, while the hue remains unchanged.\n\nIn common language, the term \"shade\" can be generalized to furthermore encompass any varieties of a particular color, whether technically they are shades, tints, tones, or slightly different hues;   while the term \"tint\" can be generalized to refer to any lighter or darker variation of a color (e.g. Tinted windows). \n\nWhen  mixing colored light (additive color models), the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red, green and blue (RGB) is always white, not gray or black. When we mix colorants, such as the pigments in paint mixtures, a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma, or saturation, than the parent colors. This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color—a gray or near-black. Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness, or energy level; in painting, lightness is adjusted through mixture with white, black or a color's complement.\n\nIt is common among some artistic painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called shades—or to lighten a color by adding white—producing colors called tints. However, this is not always the best way for representational painting, since an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in their hues. For instance, darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows, reds and oranges, to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum. Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with reds and oranges. Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. violet-purple added to yellowish-green) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue, and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color (e.g. adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum).",
                "Primary colors are sets of colors that can be combined to make a useful range of colors.  For human applications, three primary colors are typically used, since human color vision is usually trichromatic.\n\nFor additive combination of colors, as in overlapping projected lights or in electronic visual displays, the primary colors normally used are red, green and blue. For a subtractive combination of colors, as in mixing of pigments or dyes for printing, the colors magenta, yellow and cyan are normally used.  However, red, yellow and blue are commonly used as primaries when painting or drawing. \nSee RGB color model, CMYK color model and RYB color model for more on these popular sets of primary colors.\n\nIn an additive system, choices of sets of primary colors are nearly arbitrary, subject to weak constraints from the spectral sensitivities of each of the human cone photoreceptors.  An early color photographic process, autochrome, typically used orange, green and violet primaries.  However, unless negative amounts of a color are allowed, the gamut will be restricted to the color triangle defined by the choice of primaries.\n\nThe combination of any two primary colors creates a secondary color.  The most commonly used additive color primaries are the secondary colors of the most commonly used subtractive color primaries, and vice versa.\n\nBiological basis \n\nPrimary colors are not a fundamental property of light but are related to the physiological response of the eye to light. Fundamentally, light is a continuous spectrum of the wavelengths that can be detected by the human eye, an infinite-dimensional stimulus space.  However, the human eye normally contains only three types of color receptors, called cone cells. Each color receptor responds to different ranges of the color spectrum.  Humans and other species with three such types of color receptors are known as trichromats.  These species respond to the light stimulus via a three-dimensional sensation, which generally can be modeled as a mixture of three primary colors.\n\nBefore the nature of colorimetry and visual physiology were well understood, scientists such as Thomas Young, James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz expressed various opinions about what should be the three primary colors to describe the three primary color sensations of the eye.  Young originally proposed red, green and violet, and Maxwell changed violet to blue; Helmholtz proposed \"a slightly purplish red, a vegetation-green, slightly yellowish (wavelength about 5600 tenth-metres), and an ultramarine-blue (about 4820)\".   In modern understanding, human cone cells do not correspond precisely to a specific set of primary colors, as each cone type responds to a range of color wavelengths.\n\nSpecies with different numbers of receptor cell types would have color vision requiring a different number of primaries.  For example, for species known as tetrachromats, with four different color receptors, one would use four primary colors.  Since humans can only see to 380 nanometers (violet), but tetrachromats can see into the ultraviolet to about 300 nanometers, this fourth primary color for tetrachromats is located in the shorter-wavelength range. \n\nMany birds and marsupials are tetrachromats, and it has been suggested that some human females are tetrachromats as well,   having an extra variant version of the long-wave (L) cone type. \nThe peak response of human color receptors varies, even among individuals with \"normal\" color vision;  in non-human species this polymorphic variation is even greater, and it may well be adaptive. \nMost placental mammals other than primates have only two types of color receptors and are therefore dichromats; to them, there are only two primary colors.\n\nIt would be incorrect to assume that the world \"looks tinted\" to an animal (or human) with anything other than the human standard of three color receptors.  To an animal (or human) born that way, the world would look normal to it, but the animal's ability to detect and discriminate colors would be different from that of a human with normal color vision.  If a human and an animal both look at a natural color, they see it as natural; however, if both look at a color reproduced via primary colors, such as on a color television screen, the human may see it as matching the natural color, while the animal does not, since the primary colors have been chosen to suit human capabilities.\n\nAdditive primaries \n\nMedia that combine emitted lights to create the sensation of a range of colors are using the additive color system. Typically, the primary colors used are red, green and blue. \n\nTelevision and other computer and video displays are a common example of the use of additive primaries and the RGB color model. The exact colors chosen for the primaries are a technological compromise between the available phosphors (including considerations such as cost and power usage) and the need for large color triangle to allow a large gamut of colors. The ITU-R BT.709-5/sRGB primaries are typical.\n\nAdditive mixing of red and green light produces shades of yellow, orange, or brown.   Mixing green and blue produces shades of cyan, and mixing red and blue produces shades of purple, including magenta. Mixing nominally equal proportions of the additive primaries results in shades of grey or white; the color space that is generated is called an RGB color space.\n\nThe CIE 1931 color space defines monochromatic primary colors with wavelengths of 435.8 nm (violet), 546.1 nm (green) and 700 nm (red).  The corners of the color triangle are therefore on the spectral locus, and the triangle is about as big as it can be.  No real display device uses such primaries, as the extreme wavelengths used for violet and red result in a very low luminous efficiency.\n\nRecent developments\n\nSome recent TV and computer displays are starting to include yellow as a fourth \"primary\" color, often in a four-point square pixel area, so as to achieve brighter pure yellows and a larger color gamut.  \nEven the four-primary technology does not yet reach the range of colors the human eye is theoretically capable of perceiving (as defined by the sample-based estimate called the Pointer Gamut ), with 4-primary LED prototypes providing typically about 87% and 5-primary prototypes about 95%.  Several firms, including Samsung and Mitsubishi, have demonstrated LED displays with five or six \"primaries\", or color  LED point light sources per pixel.   A recent academic literature review claims a gamut of 99% can be achieved with 5-primary LED technology.  While technology for achieving a wider gamut appears to be within reach, other issues remain; for example, affordability, dynamic range, and brilliance. In addition, there exists hardly any source material recorded in this wider gamut, nor is it currently possible to recover this information from existing visual media. Regardless, industry is still exploring a wide variety of \"primary\" active light sources (per pixel) with the goal of matching the capability of human color perception within a broadly affordable price. One example of a potentially affordable but yet unproven active light hybrid places a LED screen over a plasma light screen, each with different \"primaries\". Because both LED and plasma technologies are many decades old (plasma pixels going back to the 1960s), both have become so affordable that they could be combined.\n\nSubtractive primaries \n\nMedia that use reflected light and colorants to produce colors are using the subtractive color method of color mixing.\n\nCMYK color model or four-color printing \n\nIn the printing industry, to produce the varying colors the subtractive primaries cyan, magenta and yellow are applied together in varying amounts.  Before the color names cyan and magenta were in common use, these primaries were often known as blue-green and purple or in some circles as blue and red, respectively, and their exact color has changed over time with access to new pigments and technologies. \n\nMixing yellow and cyan produces green colors; mixing yellow with magenta produces reds, and mixing magenta with cyan produces blues. In theory, mixing equal amounts of all three pigments should produce grey, resulting in black when all three are applied in sufficient density, but in practice they tend to produce muddy brown colors. For this reason, and to save ink and decrease drying times, a fourth pigment, black, is often used in addition to cyan, magenta and yellow.\n\nThese results are described by the CMYK color model. The abbreviation stands for cyan, magenta, yellow and key—black is referred to as the key color, a shorthand for the key printing plate that impressed the artistic detail of an image, usually in black ink. \n\nIn practice, colorant mixtures in actual materials such as paint tend to be more complex. Brighter or more saturated colors can be created using natural pigments instead of mixing, and natural properties of pigments can interfere with the mixing. For example, mixing magenta and green in acrylic creates a dark cyan—something which would not happen if the mixing process were perfectly subtractive.\n\nIn the subtractive model, adding white to a color, whether by using less colorant or by mixing in a reflective white pigment such as zinc oxide, does not change the color's hue but does reduce its saturation.  Subtractive color printing works best when the surface or paper is white, or close to it.\n\nA system of subtractive color does not have a simple chromaticity gamut analogous to the RGB color triangle, but a gamut that must be described in three dimensions.  There are many ways to visualize such models, using various 2D chromaticity spaces or in 3D color spaces.\n\nHistory \n\nRYB color model \n\nRYB (red, yellow and blue) is a historical set of colors. It is primarily used in art and art education, particularly painting.  It predates modern scientific color theory.\n\nRYB make up the primary colors in a painter's color wheel; the secondary colors OGV (orange, green and violet) make up another triad.  Triads are formed by three equidistant colors on a particular color wheel; neither RYB nor OGV is equidistant on a perceptually uniform color wheel, but rather have been defined to be equidistant in the RYB wheel. \n\nPainters have long used more than three \"primary\" colors in their palettes—and at one point considered red, yellow, blue and green to be the four primaries. Red, yellow, blue and green are still widely considered the four psychological primary colors,  though red, yellow and blue are sometimes listed as the three psychological primaries,  with black and white occasionally added as a fourth and fifth. \n\nDuring the 18th century, as theorists became aware of Isaac Newton's scientific experiments with light and prisms, red, yellow and blue became the canonical primary colors—supposedly the fundamental sensory qualities that are blended in the perception of all physical colors and equally in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes.  This theory became dogma, despite abundant evidence that red, yellow and blue primaries cannot mix all other colors, and has survived in color theory to the present day. \n\nUsing red, yellow, and blue as primaries yields a relatively small gamut, in which, among other problems, colorful greens, cyans, purples and magentas are impossible to mix, because red, yellow and blue do not correspond to the subtractive primaries dictated by human color vision. For this reason, modern three- or four-color printing processes, as well as color photography, use cyan, yellow and magenta as primaries instead:   Cyan pigment absorbs red light (reflects blue and green), magenta absorbs green (reflects red and blue), and yellow absorbs blue (reflects red and green); each of these pigments reflects a unique set of two of the colors that the human eye perceives as primaries.\n\nMost painters include colors in their palettes which cannot be mixed from yellow, red and blue paints, and thus do not fit within the RYB color model.  Some who do use a three-color palette opt for the cyan, yellow and magenta used by printers; others paint with six or more colors, in order to widen the gamuts.  The cyan, magenta and yellow used in printing are sometimes known as \"process blue,\" \"process red\" and \"process yellow.\"[http://www.printoutlet.us/glossary.php?glossaryid=2526 Cheap Brochure Printing – Process Blue / Process Red / Process Yellow / Process Black]\n\nPsychological primaries \n\nMain article: Opponent process. See also: Natural Color System, Unique hues\n\nThe opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cones and rods in an antagonistic manner.  The three types of cones have some overlap in the wavelengths of light to which they respond, so it is more efficient for the visual system to record differences between the responses of cones, rather than each type of cone's individual response. The opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels: red versus green, blue versus yellow and black versus white.  Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those of the other color. The theory states that the particular colors considered by an observer to be uniquely representative of the concepts red, yellow, green, blue, white and black might be called \"psychological primary colors\", because any other color could be described in terms of some combination of these."

                "The war in Afghanistan (or the American war in Afghanistan)\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n  is the period in which the United States invaded Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks.  Supported initially by close allies, they were later joined by NATO beginning in 2003. It followed the Afghan Civil War's 1996–2001 phase. Its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and to deny it a safe base of operations in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power.  Key allies, including the United Kingdom, supported the U.S. from the start to the end of the phase. This phase of the war is the longest war in United States history.     \n\nIn 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda; bin Laden had already been wanted by the United Nations since 1999. The Taliban declined to extradite him unless given what they deemed convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks  and declined demands to extradite other terrorism suspects apart from bin Laden. The request was dismissed by the U.S. as a delaying tactic, and on 7 October 2001 it launched Operation Enduring Freedom with the United Kingdom. The two were later joined by other forces, including the Northern Alliance.   In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), to assist the Afghan interim authorities with securing Kabul. At the Bonn Conference in December 2001, Hamid Karzai was selected to head the Afghan Interim Administration, which after a 2002 loya jirga in Kabul became the Afghan Transitional Administration. In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. \n\nNATO became involved as an alliance in August 2003, taking the helm of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), and later that year assumed leadership of ISAF with troops from 43 countries. NATO members provided the core of the force.  One portion of U.S. forces in Afghanistan operated under NATO command; the rest remained under direct U.S. command. Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement, and in 2003, launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF.   Though outgunned and outnumbered, insurgents from the Taliban, Haqqani Network, Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin and other groups have waged asymmetric warfare with guerilla raids and ambushes in the countryside, suicide attacks against urban targets and turncoat killings against coalition forces. The Taliban exploited weaknesses in the Afghan government, among the most corrupt in the world, to reassert influence across rural areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan. ISAF responded in 2006 by increasing troops for counterinsurgency operations to \"clear and hold\" villages and \"nation building\" projects to \"win hearts and minds\".   While ISAF continued to battle the Taliban insurgency, fighting crossed into neighboring North-West Pakistan. \n\nOn 2 May 2011, United States Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in Abbotabad, Pakistan. In May 2012, NATO leaders endorsed an exit strategy for withdrawing their forces. UN-backed peace talks have since taken place between the Afghan government and the Taliban.  In May 2014, the United States announced that \"[its] combat operations [would] end in 2014, [leaving] just a small residual force in the country until the end of 2016\".  As of 2015, tens of thousands of people have been killed in the war. Over 4,000 ISAF soldiers and civilian contractors as well as over 15,000 Afghan national security forces members have been killed, as well as nearly 20 thousand civilians. In October 2014, British forces handed over the last bases in Helmand to the Afghan military, officially ending their combat operations in the war.  On 28 December 2014, NATO formally ended combat operations in Afghanistan and transferred full security responsibility to the Afghan government, via a ceremony in Kabul.  \n\nBefore the start of war\n\nOrigins of Afghanistan's civil war \n\nAfghanistan's political order began to break down with the overthrow of King Zahir Shah by his cousin Mohammed Daoud Khan in a bloodless 1973 coup. Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, emancipation of women, and Pashtun nationalism. This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive Pashtun population. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto began to encourage Afghan Islamic leaders such as Burhanuddin Rabbani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in a coup by Afghan's Communist Party, his former partner in government, known as the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition from Islamic leaders across rural areas. The PDPA's crackdown was met with open rebellion, including Ismail Khan's Herat Uprising. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on 11 September 1979 when Hafizullah Amin ousted Nur Muhammad Taraki. The Soviet Union, sensing PDPA weakness, intervened militarily three months later, to depose Amin and install another PDA faction led by Babrak Karmal.\n\nThe entry of the Soviet Union into Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its Cold War rivals, the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously motivated mujahideen held sway in much of the countryside. Beside Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included Jalaluddin Haqqani. The CIA worked closely with Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen. The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \"Afghan Arabs\", including Osama bin Laden.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan in May 1989, the PDPA regime under Najibullah held on until 1992, when the collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general Abdul Rashid Dostum cleared the approach to Kabul. With the political stage cleared of Afghan socialists, the remaining Islamic warlords vied for power. By then, Bin Laden had left the country. The United States' interest in Afghanistan also diminished.\n\nWarlord rule (1992–1996) \n\nIn 1992, Rabbani officially became president of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, but had to battle other warlords for control of Kabul. In late 1994, Rabbani's defense minister, Ahmad Shah Massoud defeated Hekmatyr in Kabul and ended ongoing bombardment of the capital.    Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation. Other warlords, including Ismail Khan in the west and Dostum in the north maintained their fiefdoms.\n\nIn 1994, Mohammed Omar, a mujahideen member who taught at a Pakistani madrassa, returned to Kandahar and formed the Taliban movement. His followers were religious students, known as the Talib and they sought to end warlordism through strict adherence to Islamic law. By November 1994, the Taliban had captured all of Kandahar Province. They declined the government's offer to join in a coalition government and marched on Kabul in 1995. \n\nTaliban Emirate vs Northern Alliance \n\nThe Taliban's early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of costly defeats.  Pakistan provided strong support to the Taliban.   Analysts such as Amin Saikal described the group as developing into a proxy force for Pakistan's regional interests, which the Taliban denied. The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early 1995, but were driven back by Massoud. \n\nOn 27 September 1996, the Taliban, with military support by Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia, seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. They imposed their fundamentalist interpretation of Islam in areas under their control, issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school, or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative.  According to the Pakistani expert Ahmed Rashid, \"between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan\" on the side of the Taliban.Peter Tomsen said that up until 9/11, Pakistani military and ISI officers, along with thousands of regular Pakistani armed forces personnel, had been involved in the fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nMassoud and Dostum, former arch-enemies, created a United Front against the Taliban, commonly known as the Northern Alliance.  In addition to Massoud's Tajik force and Dostum's Uzbeks, the United Front included Hazara factions and Pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as Abdul Haq and Haji Abdul Qadir. Abdul Haq also gathered a limited number of defecting Pashtun Taliban. Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king Zahir Shah. International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which the journalist Steve Coll referred to as the \"grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance\", said, \"It's crazy that you have this today … Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara … They were all ready to buy in to the process … to work under the king's banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan.\"  The Northern Alliance received varying degrees of support from Russia, Iran, Tajikistan and India.\n\nThe Taliban captured Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998 and drove Dostum into exile.\n\nThe conflict was brutal. According to the United Nations (UN), the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians. UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001. The Taliban especially targeted the Shiite Hazaras.   In retaliation for the execution of 3,000 Taliban prisoners by Uzbek general Abdul Malik Pahlawan in 1997, the Taliban executed about 4,000 civilians after taking Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998.  \n\nBin Laden's so-called 055 Brigade was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians.  The report by the United Nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing \"Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people\".\n\nBy 2001, the Taliban controlled as much as 90% of the country, with the Northern Alliance confined to the country's northeast corner. Fighting alongside Taliban forces were some 28,000–30,000 Pakistanis and 2,000–3,000 Al-Qaeda militants. Many of the Pakistanis were recruited from madrassas. A 1998 document by the U.S. State Department confirmed that \"20–40 percent of [regular] Taliban soldiers are Pakistani.\" The document said that many of the parents of those Pakistani nationals \"know nothing regarding their child's military involvement with the Taliban until their bodies are brought back to Pakistan\". According to the U.S. State Department report and reports by Human Rights Watch, other Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan were regular soldiers, especially from the Frontier Corps, but also from the army providing direct combat support. \n\nAl-Qaeda \n\nIn August 1996, Bin Laden was forced to leave Sudan and arrived in Jalabad, Afghanistan. He had founded Al-Qaeda in the late 1980s to support the mujahideen's war against the Soviets, but became disillusioned by infighting among warlords. He grew close to Mullah Omar and moved Al-Qaeda's operations to eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission in the U.S. reported found that under the Taliban, al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and indoctrinate fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other jihadists, and plot terrorist actions. While al-Qaeda maintained its own camps in Afghanistan, it also supported training camps of other organizations. An estimated 10,000 and 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front. A smaller number were inducted into al-Qaeda.\n\nAfter the August 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings were linked to bin Laden, President Bill Clinton ordered missile strikes on militant training camps in Afghanistan. U.S. officials pressed the Taliban to surrender bin Laden. In 1999, the international community imposed sanctions on the Taliban, calling for bin Laden to be surrendered. The Taliban repeatedly rebuffed these demands.\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA) Special Activities Division paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama bin Laden. These teams planned several operations, but did not receive the order to proceed from President Clinton. Their efforts built relationships with Afghan leaders that proved essential in the 2001 invasion.\n\nChange in U.S. policy toward Afghanistan \n\nDuring the Clinton administration, the U.S. tended to favor Pakistan and until 1998–1999 had no clear policy toward Afghanistan. In 1997, for example, the U.S. State Department's Robin Raphel told Massoud to surrender to the Taliban. Massoud responded that, as long as he controlled an area the size of his hat, he would continue to defend it from the Taliban. Around the same time, top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan to try to persuade the United Front not to take advantage of a chance to make crucial gains against the Taliban. They insisted it was the time for a cease-fire and an arms embargo. At the time, Pakistan began a \"Berlin-like airlift to resupply and re-equip the Taliban\", financed with Saudi money. \n\nU.S. policy toward Afghanistan changed after the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings. Subsequently, Osama bin Laden was indicted for his involvement in the embassy bombings. In 1999 both the U.S. and the United Nations enacted sanctions against the Taliban via United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267, which demanded the Taliban surrender Osama bin Laden for trial in the U.S. and close all terrorist bases in Afghanistan.  The only collaboration between Massoud and the US at the time was an effort with the CIA to trace bin Laden following the 1998 bombings. The U.S. and the European Union provided no support to Massoud for the fight against the Taliban.\n\nBy 2001 the change of policy sought by CIA officers who knew Massoud was underway. CIA lawyers, working with officers in the Near East Division and Counter-terrorist Center, began to draft a formal finding for President George W. Bush's signature, authorizing a covert action program in Afghanistan. It would be the first in a decade to seek to influence the course of the Afghan war in favor of Massoud. Richard A. Clarke, chair of the Counter-Terrorism Security Group under the Clinton administration, and later an official in the Bush administration, allegedly presented a plan to incoming Bush National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice in January 2001.\n\nA change in US policy was effected in August 2001. The Bush administration agreed on a plan to start supporting Massoud. A meeting of top national security officials agreed that the Taliban would be presented with an ultimatum to hand over bin Laden and other al-Qaeda operatives. If the Taliban refused, the US would provide covert military aid to anti-Taliban groups. If both those options failed, \"the deputies agreed that the United States would seek to overthrow the Taliban regime through more direct action.\" \n\nNorthern Alliance on the eve of 9/11 \n\nAhmad Shah Massoud was the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan. In the areas under his control, Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the Women's Rights Declaration. As a consequence, many civilians had fled to areas under his control.   In total, estimates range up to one million people fleeing the Taliban. \n\nIn late 2000, Ahmad Shah Massoud, a Tajik nationalist and leader of the Northern Alliance, invited several other prominent Afghan tribal leaders to a jirga in northern Afghanistan \"to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan\".  Among those in attendance were Pashtun nationalists, Abdul Haq and Hamid Karzai. Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert Peter Tomsen wrote: \"The 'Lion of Kabul' [Abdul Haq] and the 'Lion of Panjshir' [Ahmad Shah Massoud] … Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan's three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun—non-Pashtun, north-south divide.\"\n\nIn early 2001, Massoud and several other Afghan leaders addressed the European Parliament in Brussels, asking the international community to provide humanitarian help. The Afghan envoy asserted that the Taliban and al-Qaeda had introduced \"a very wrong perception of Islam\" and that without the support of Pakistan and Osama bin Laden, the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for another year. Massoud warned that his intelligence had gathered information about an imminent, large-scale attack on U.S. soil. \n\nOn 9 September 2001, two French-speaking Algerians posing as journalists killed Massoud in a suicide attack in Takhar Province of Afghanistan. The two perpetrators were later alleged to be members of al-Qaeda. They were interviewing Massoud before detonating a bomb hidden in their video camera.   Both of the alleged al-Qaeda men were subsequently killed by Massoud's guards.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001 attacks\n\nOn the morning of 11 September 2001, a total of 19 Arab men carried out four coordinated attacks in the United States. Four commercial passenger jet airliners were hijacked.   The hijackers – members of al-Qaeda's Hamburg cell –  intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing everyone on board and more than 2000 people in the buildings. Both buildings collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C.. The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, in rural Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C., to target the White House, or the U.S. Capitol. No one aboard the flights survived. According to the New York State Health Department, the death toll among responders including firefighters and police was 836 as of June 2009. Total deaths were 2996, including the 19 hijackers. \n\nU.S. invasion of Afghanistan\n\nThe United States invasion of Afghanistan occurred after the September 11 attacks in late 2001,  supported by allies including the United Kingdom.\n\nU.S. President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan. Bin Laden had been wanted by the U.N. since 1999 for the prior attack on the World Trade Center. The Taliban declined to extradite him unless the United States provided convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks. They ignored U.S. demands to shut down terrorist bases and hand over other terrorist suspects. The request for proof of bin Laden's involvement was dismissed by the U.S. as a meaningless delaying tactic.\n\nGeneral Tommy Franks, then-commanding general of Central Command (CENTCOM), initially proposed immediately after the 9/11 attacks to President George W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that the U.S. invade Afghanistan using a conventional force of 60,000 troops, preceded by six months of preparation. Rumsfield and Bush feared that a conventional invasion of Afghanistan could bog down as had happened to the Soviets and the British.  Rumsfield rejected Frank's plan, saying \"I want men on the ground now!\" Franks returned the next day with a plan utilizing Special Forces.  On September 26, 2001, fifteen days after the 9/11 attack, the U.S. covertly inserted members of the CIA's Special Activities Division led by Gary Schroen as part of team Jawbreaker into Afghanistan, forming the Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team.    They linked up with the Northern Alliance as part of Task Force Dagger. \n\nTwo weeks later, Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 555 and 595, both 12-man Green Beret teams from 5th Special Forces Group, plus Air Force combat controllers, were airlifted by helicopter from the Karshi-Khanabad Air Base in Uzbekistan page 127ff more than 300 km across the 16000 ft Hindu Kush mountains in zero-visibility conditions by two SOAR MH-47E Chinook helicopters. The Chinooks were refueled in-flight three times during the 11-hour mission, establishing a new world record for combat rotorcraft missions at the time. They linked up with the CIA and Northern Alliance. Within a few weeks the Northern Alliance, with assistance from the U.S. ground and air forces, captured several key cities from the Taliban.\n\nThe U.S. officially launched Operation Enduring Freedom on 7 October 2001 with the assistance of the United Kingdom. The two were later joined by other countries. The U.S. and its allies drove the Taliban from power and built military bases near major cities across the country. Most al-Qaeda and Taliban were not captured, escaping to neighboring Pakistan or retreating to rural or remote mountainous regions.\n\nOn 20 December 2001, the United Nations authorized an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), with a mandate to help the Afghans maintain security in Kabul and surrounding areas. It was initially established from the headquarters of the British 3rd Mechanised Division under Major General John McColl, and for its first years numbered no more that 5,000.  Its mandate did not extend beyond the Kabul area for the first few years.  Eighteen countries were contributing to the force in February 2002.\n\nAt the Bonn Conference in December 2001, Hamid Karzai was selected to head the Afghan Interim Administration, which after a 2002 loya jirga in Kabul became the Afghan Transitional Administration. In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\n\nIn August 2003, NATO became involved as an alliance, taking the helm of the International Security Assistance Force. One portion of U.S. forces in Afghanistan operated under NATO command; the rest remained under direct U.S. command. Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement, and in 2003, launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF.\n\nAn insurgency gains strength\n\nAfter evading coalition forces throughout mid-2002, Taliban remnants gradually regained confidence and prepared to launch the Taliban insurgency that Omar had promised.  During September, Taliban forces began a jihad recruitment drive in Pashtun areas in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pamphlets distributed in secret appeared in many villages in southeastern Afghanistan called for jihad. \n\nSmall mobile training camps were established along the border to train recruits in guerrilla warfare.  Most were drawn from tribal area madrassas in Pakistan. Bases, a few with as many as 200 fighters, emerged in the tribal areas by the summer of 2003. Pakistani will to prevent infiltration was uncertain, while Pakistani military operations proved of little use. \n\nThe Taliban gathered into groups of around 50 to launch attacks on isolated outposts, and then breaking up into groups of 5–10 to evade counterattacks. Coalition forces were attacked indirectly, through rocket attacks on bases and improvised explosive devices.\n\nTo coordinate the strategy, Omar named a 10-man leadership council, with himself as its leader. Five operational zones were assigned to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah, who took charge in Zabul province. Al-Qaeda forces in the east had a bolder strategy of attacking Americans using elaborate ambushes.\nThe first sign of the strategy came on 27 January 2003, during Operation Mongoose, when a band of fighters were assaulted by U.S. forces at the Adi Ghar cave complex 15 mi north of Spin Boldak.  18 rebels were reported killed with no U.S. casualties. The site was suspected to be a base for supplies and fighters coming from Pakistan. The first isolated attacks by relatively large Taliban bands on Afghan targets also appeared around that time.\n\nAs the summer continued, Taliban attacks gradually increased in frequency. Dozens of Afghan government soldiers, NGO humanitarian workers, and several U.S. soldiers died in the raids, ambushes and rocket attacks. Besides guerrilla attacks, Taliban fighters began building up forces in the district of Dai Chopan in Zabul Province. The Taliban decided to make a stand there. Over the course of the summer, up to 1,000 guerrillas moved there. Over 220 people, including several dozen Afghan police, were killed in August 2003. In late August 2005, Afghan government forces attacked, backed by U.S. troops with air support. After a one-week battle, Taliban forces were routed with up to 124 fighters killed.\n\nOn 11 August 2003, NATO assumed control of ISAF. On 31 July 2006, ISAF assumed command of the south of the country, and by 5 October 2006, of the east. Once this transition had taken place, ISAF grew to a large coalition involving up to 46 countries, under a U.S. commander.\n\n2006: Southern Afghanistan\n\nFrom January 2006, a multinational ISAF contingent started to replace U.S. troops in southern Afghanistan. The British 16th Air Assault Brigade (later reinforced by Royal Marines) formed the core of the force, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British,  2,300 Canadian,  1,963 Dutch, 300 Australian,  290 Danish and 150 Estonian troops.  Air support was provided by U.S., British, Dutch, Norwegian and French combat aircraft and helicopters.\n\nIn January 2006, NATO's focus in southern Afghanistan was to form Provincial Reconstruction Teams with the British leading in Helmand while the Netherlands and Canada would lead similar deployments in Orūzgān and Kandahar, respectively. Local Taliban figures pledged to resist. \n\nSouthern Afghanistan faced in 2006 the deadliest violence since the Taliban's fall. NATO operations were led by British, Canadian and Dutch commanders. Operation Mountain Thrust was launched on 17 May 2006, with. In July, Canadian Forces, supported by U.S., British, Dutch and Danish forces, launched Operation Medusa.\n\nA combined force of Dutch and Australians launched a successful offensive between late April to mid July 2006 to push the Taliban out of the Chora and Baluchi areas.\n\nOn 18 September 2006 Italian special forces of Task Force 45 and airborne troopers of the 'Trieste' infantry regiment of the Rapid Reaction Corps composed of Italian and Spanish forces, took part in 'Wyconda Pincer' operation in the districts of Bala Buluk and Pusht-i-Rod, in Farah province. Italian forces killed at least 70 Taliban. The situation in RC-W then deteriorated. Hotspots included Badghis in the very north and Farah in the southwest.\n\nFurther NATO operations included the Battle of Panjwaii, Operation Mountain Fury and Operation Falcon Summit. NATO achieved tactical victories and area denial, but the Taliban were not completely defeated. NATO operations continued into 2007.\n\n2007: Coalition offensive\n\nIn January and February 2007, British Royal Marines mounted Operation Volcano to clear insurgents from firing-points in the village of Barikju, north of Kajaki.  Other major operations during this period included Operation Achilles (March–May) and Operation Lastay Kulang. The UK Ministry of Defence announced its intention to bring British troop levels in the country up to 7,700 (committed until 2009).  Further operations, such as Operation Silver and Operation Silicon, took place to keep up the pressure on the Taliban in the hope of blunting their expected spring offensive.  \n\nIn February 2007, Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan inactivated. Combined Joint Task Force 76, a two-star U.S. command headquartered on Bagram Airfield, assumed responsibility as the National Command Element for U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan, or CSTC-A, the other two-star U.S. command, was charged with training and mentoring the Afghan National Security Forces.\n\nOn 4 March 2007, U.S. Marines killed at least 12 civilians and injured 33 in Shinwar district, Nangrahar,  in a response to a bomb ambush. The event became known as the \"Shinwar massacre\".  The 120 member Marine unit responsible for the attack were ordered to leave the country by Army Major General Frank Kearney, because the incident damaged the unit's relations with the local Afghan population. \n\nLater in March 2007, the US added more than 3,500 troops.\n\nOn 12 May 2007, ISAF forces killed Mullah Dadullah. Eleven other Taliban fighters died in the same firefight.\n\nDuring the summer, NATO forces achieved tactical victories at the Battle of Chora in Orūzgān, where Dutch and Australian ISAF forces were deployed.\n\nOn 16 August, eight civilians including a pregnant woman and a baby died when Polish soldiers shelled the village of Nangar Khel, Paktika Province. Seven soldiers have been charged with war crimes.\n\nOn 28 October about 80 Taliban fighters were killed in a 24-hour battle in Helmand. \n\nWestern officials and analysts estimated the strength of Taliban forces at about 10,000 fighters fielded at any given time. Of that number, only 2,000 to 3,000 were highly motivated, full-time insurgents. The rest were part-timers, made up of alienated, young Afghans, angered by bombing raids or responding to payment. In 2007, more foreign fighters came than ever before, according to officials. Approximately 100 to 300 full-time combatants are foreigners, usually from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Chechnya, various Arab countries and perhaps even Turkey and western China. They were reportedly more fanatical and violent, often bringing superior video-production or bombmaking expertise. \n\nOn 2 November security forces killed a top-ranking militant, Mawlawi Abdul Manan, after he was caught crossing the border. The Taliban confirmed his death.  On 10 November the Taliban ambushed a patrol in eastern Afghanistan. This attack brought the U.S. death toll for 2007 to 100, making it the Americans' deadliest year in Afghanistan. \n\nThe Battle of Musa Qala took place in December. Afghan units were the principal fighting force, supported by British forces.  Taliban forces were forced out of the town.\n\nReassessment and renewed commitment from 2008\n\nAdmiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that while the situation in Afghanistan is \"precarious and urgent\", the 10,000 additional troops needed there would be unavailable \"in any significant manner\" unless withdrawals from Iraq are made. The priority was Iraq first, Afghanistan second. \n\nIn the first five months of 2008, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan increased by over 80% with a surge of 21,643 more troops, bringing the total from 26,607 in January to 48,250 in June.  In September 2008, President Bush announced the withdrawal of over 8,000 from Iraq and a further increase of up to 4,500 in Afghanistan. \n\nIn June 2008, British prime minister Gordon Brown announced the number of British troops serving in Afghanistan would increase to 8,030 – a rise of 230.  The same month, the UK lost its 100th serviceman. \n\nOn 13 June, Taliban fighters demonstrated their ongoing strength, liberating all prisoners in Kandahar jail. The operation freed 1200 prisoners, 400 of whom were Taliban, causing a major embarrassment for NATO. \n\nOn 13 July 2008, a coordinated Taliban attack was launched on a remote NATO base at Wanat in Kunar province. On 19 August, French troops suffered their worst losses in Afghanistan in an ambush.  Later in the month, an airstrike targeted a Taliban commander in Herat province and killed 90 civilians.\n\nLate August saw one of NATO's largest operations in Helmand, Operation Eagle's Summit, aiming to bring electricity to the region. \n\nOn 3 September, commandos, believed to be U.S. Army Special Forces, landed by helicopter and attacked three houses close to a known enemy stronghold in Pakistan. The attack killed between seven and twenty people. Local residents claimed that most of the dead were civilians. Pakistan condemned the attack, calling the incursion \"a gross violation of Pakistan's territory\".  \n\nOn 6 September, in an apparent reaction, Pakistan announced an indefinite disconnection of supply lines. \n\nOn 11 September, militants killed two U.S. troops in the east. This brought the total number of U.S. losses to 113, more than in any prior year.  Several European countries set their own records, particularly the UK, who suffered 108 casualties. \n\nTaliban attacks on supply lines\n\nIn November and December 2008, multiple incidents of major theft, robbery, and arson attacks afflicted NATO supply convoys in Pakistan.    Transport companies south of Kabul were extorted for money by the Taliban.  These incidents included the hijacking of a NATO convoy carrying supplies in Peshawar, the torching of cargo trucks and Humvees east of the Khyber pass  and a half-dozen raids on NATO supply depots near Peshawar that destroyed 300 cargo trucks and Humvees in December 2008. \n\nIssues with Pakistan\n\nAn unnamed senior Pentagon official told the BBC that at some point between 12 July and 12 September 2008, President Bush issued a classified order authorizing raids against militants in Pakistan. Pakistan said it would not allow foreign forces onto its territory and that it would vigorously protect its sovereignty.  In September, the Pakistan military stated that it had issued orders to \"open fire\" on U.S. soldiers who crossed the border in pursuit of militant forces. \n\nOn 25 September 2008, Pakistani troops fired on ISAF helicopters. This caused confusion and anger in the Pentagon, which asked for a full explanation into the incident and denied that U.S. helicopters were in Pakistani airspace.\n\nA further split occurred when U.S. troops apparently landed on Pakistani soil to carry out an operation against militants in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. 'Pakistan reacted angrily to the action, saying 20 innocent villagers had been killed by US troops'.  However, despite tensions, the U.S. increased the use of remotely piloted drone aircraft in Pakistan's border regions, in particular the Federally Administered Tribal Regions (FATA) and Balochistan; as of early 2009, drone attacks were up 183% since 2006. \n\nBy the end of 2008, the Taliban apparently had severed remaining ties with al-Qaeda.  According to senior U.S. military intelligence officials, perhaps fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remained in Afghanistan. \n\nIn a meeting with General Stanley McChrystal, Pakistani military officials urged international forces to remain on the Afghan side of the border and prevent militants from fleeing into Pakistan. Pakistan noted that it had deployed 140,000 soldiers on its side of the border to address militant activities, while the coalition had only 100,000 soldiers to police the Afghanistan side. \n\n2009: Southern Afghanistan\n\nNorthern Distribution Network\n\nIn response to the increased risk of sending supplies through Pakistan, work began on the establishment of a Northern Distribution Network (NDN) through Russia and Central Asian republics. Initial permission to move supplies through the region was given on 20 January 2009, after a visit to the region by General David Petraeus.  The first shipment along the NDN route left on 20 February from Riga, Latvia, then traveled 3212 mi to the Uzbek town of Termez on the Afghanistan border. In addition to Riga, other European ports included Poti, Georgia and Vladivostok, Russia. U.S. commanders hoped that 100 containers a day would be shipped along the NDN.  By comparison, 140 containers a day were typically shipped through the Khyber Pass.  By 2011, the NDN handled about 40% of Afghanistan-bound traffic, versus 30% through Pakistan. \n\nOn 11 May 2009, Uzbekistan president Islam Karimov announced that the airport in Navoi (Uzbekistan) was being used to transport non-lethal cargo into Afghanistan. Due to the still unsettled relationship between Uzbekistan and the U.S. following the 2005 Andijon massacre and subsequent expulsion of U.S. forces from Karshi-Khanabad airbase, U.S. forces were not involved in the shipments. Instead, South Korea's Korean Air, which overhauled Navoi's airport, officially handled logistics. \n\nOriginally only non-lethal resources were allowed on the NDN. In July 2009, however, shortly before a visit by new President Barack Obama to Moscow, Russian authorities announced that U.S. troops and weapons could use the country's airspace to reach Afghanistan. \n\nHuman rights advocates were (as of 2009) concerned that the U.S. was again working with the government of Uzbekistan, which is often accused of violating human rights.  U.S. officials promised increased cooperation with Uzbekistan, including further assistance to turn Navoi into a regional distribution center for both military and civilian ventures.  \n\nIncrease in U.S. troops\n\nIn January, about 3,000 U.S. soldiers from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 10th Mountain Division moved into the provinces of Logar and Wardak. Afghan Federal Guards fought alongside them. The troops were the first wave of an expected surge of reinforcements originally ordered by President Bush and increased by President Obama. \n\nIn mid-February, it was announced that 17,000 additional troops would be deployed in two brigades and support troops; the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade of about 3,500 and the 5th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, a Stryker Brigade with about 4,000.  ISAF commander General David McKiernan had called for as many as 30,000 additional troops, effectively doubling the number of troops.  On 23 September, a classified assessment by General McChrystal included his conclusion that a successful counterinsurgency strategy would require 500,000 troops and five years. \n\nIn November, Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry sent two classified cables to Washington expressing concerns about sending more troops before the Afghan government demonstrates that it is willing to tackle the corruption and mismanagement that has fueled the Taliban's rise. Eikenberry, a retired three-star general who in 2006–2007 commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan, also expressed frustration with the relative paucity of funds set aside for development and reconstruction.  In subsequent cables, Eikenberry repeatedly cautioned that deploying sizable American reinforcements would result in \"astronomical costs\" – tens of billions of dollars – and would only deepen the Afghan government's dependence on the United States.\n\nOn 26 November, Karzai made a public plea for direct negotiations with the Taliban leadership. Karzai said there is an \"urgent need\" for negotiations and made it clear that the Obama administration had opposed such talks. There was no formal US response.  \n\nOn 1 December, Obama announced at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point that the U.S. would send 30,000 more troops.  Antiwar organizations in the U.S. responded quickly, and cities throughout the U.S. saw protests on 2 December.  Many protesters compared the decision to deploy more troops in Afghanistan to the expansion of the Vietnam War under the Johnson administration. \n\nKunduz airstrike\n\nOn 4 September, during the Kunduz Province Campaign a devastating NATO air raid was conducted 7 kilometres southwest of Kunduz where Taliban fighters had hijacked civilian supply trucks, killing up to 179 people, including over 100 civilians. \n\nOperation Khanjar and Operation Panther's Claw\n\nOn 25 June US officials announced the launch of Operation Khanjar (\"strike of the sword\").  About 4000 U.S. Marines from the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade  and 650 Afghan soldiers  participated. Khanjar followed a British-led operation named Operation Panther's Claw in the same region.  Officials called it the Marines' largest operation since the 2004 invasion of Fallujah, Iraq. Operation Panther's Claw was aimed to secure various canal and river crossings to establish a long-term ISAF presence. \n\nInitially, Afghan and American soldiers moved into towns and villages along the Helmand River to protect the civilian population. The main objective was to push into insurgent strongholds along the river. A secondary aim was to bring security to the Helmand Valley in time for presidential elections, set to take place on 20 August.\n\nTaliban gains\n\nAccording to a 22 December briefing by Major General Michael T. Flynn, the top U.S. intelligence officer in Afghanistan, \"The Taliban retains [the] required partnerships to sustain support, fuel legitimacy and bolster capacity.\"  The 23-page briefing states that \"Security incidents [are] projected to be higher in 2010.\" Those incidents were already up by 300 percent since 2007 and by 60 percent since 2008, according to the briefing.  NATO intelligence at the time indicated that the Taliban had as many as 25,000 dedicated soldiers, almost as many as before 9/11 and more than in 2005. \n\nOn 10 August McChrystal, newly appointed as U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said that the Taliban had gained the upper hand. In a continuation of the Taliban's usual strategy of summer offensives,  the militants aggressively spread their influence into north and west Afghanistan and stepped up their attack in an attempt to disrupt presidential polls.  Calling the Taliban a \"very aggressive enemy\", he added that the U.S. strategy was to stop their momentum and focus on protecting and safeguarding Afghan civilians, calling it \"hard work\". \n\nThe Taliban's claim that the over 135 violent incidents disrupting elections was largely disputed. However, the media was asked to not report on any violent incidents.  Some estimates reported voter turn out as much less than the expected 70 percent. In southern Afghanistan where the Taliban held the most power, voter turnout was low and sporadic violence was directed at voters and security personnel. The chief observer of the European Union election mission, General Philippe Morillon, said the election was \"generally fair\" but \"not free\". \n\nWestern election observers had difficulty accessing southern regions, where at least 9 Afghan civilians and 14 security forces were killed in attacks intended to intimidate voters. The Taliban released a video days after the elections, filming on the road between Kabul and Kandahar, stopping vehicles and asking to see their fingers. The video went showed ten men who had voted, listening to a Taliban militant. The Taliban pardoned the voters because of Ramadan.  The Taliban attacked towns with rockets and other indirect fire. Amid claims of widespread fraud, both top contenders, Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, claimed victory. Reports suggested that turnout was lower than in the prior election. \n\nAfter Karzai's alleged win of 54 per cent, which would prevent a runoff, over 400,000 Karzai votes had to be disallowed after accusations of fraud. Some nations criticized the elections as \"free but not fair\". \n\nIn December, an attack on Forward Operating Base Chapman, used by the CIA to gather information and to coordinate drone attacks against Taliban leaders, killed at least six CIA officers.\n\n2010: American–British offensive and Afghan peace initiative\n\nIn public statements U.S. officials had previously praised Pakistan's military effort against militants during its offensive in South Waziristan in November 2009.  Karzai started peace talks with Haqqani network groups in March 2010,  and there were other peace initiatives including the Afghan Peace Jirga 2010. In July 2010, a U.S. Army report read: \"It seems to always be this way when we go there [to meet civilians]. No one wants anything to do with us.\" A report on meeting up with school representatives mentioned students throwing rocks at soldiers and not welcoming their arrival, as had been reported on several occasions elsewhere.  President Zardari said that Pakistan had spent over 35 billion U.S. dollars during the previous eight years fighting against militancy.  According to the Afghan government, approximately 900 Taliban were killed in operations conducted during 2010.  Due to increased use of IEDs by insurgents the number of injured coalition soldiers, mainly Americans, significantly increased.Perry, Tom, \"U.S. Troops in Afghanistan Suffer More Critical Injuries\", Los Angeles Times, 7 April 2011, p. 4. Beginning in May 2010 NATO special forces began to concentrate on operations to capture or kill specific Taliban leaders. As of March 2011, the U.S. military claimed that the effort had resulted in the capture or killing of more than 900 low- to mid-level Taliban commanders.   Overall, 2010 saw the most insurgent attacks of any year since the war began, peaking in September at more than 1,500. Insurgent operations increased \"dramatically\" in two-thirds of Afghan provinces. \n\nTroop surge\n\nDeployment of additional U.S. troops continued in early 2010, with 9,000 of the planned 30,000 in place before the end of March and another 18,000 expected by June, with the 101st Airborne Division as the main source. U.S. troops in Afghanistan outnumbered those in Iraq for the first time since 2003. \n\nThe CIA, following a request by General McChrystal, planned to increase teams of operatives, including elite SAD officers, with U.S. military special operations forces. This combination worked well in Iraq and was largely credited with the success of that surge.  The CIA also increased its campaign using Hellfire missile strikes on Al-Qaeda in Pakistan. The number of strikes in 2010, 115, more than doubled the 50 drone attacks that occurred in 2009. \n\nThe surge in troops supported a sixfold increase in Special Forces operations.  700 airstrikes occurred in September 2010 alone versus 257 in all of 2009. From July 2010 to October 2010, 300 Taliban commanders and 800-foot soldiers were killed.  Hundreds more insurgent leaders were killed or captured as 2010 ended. Petraeus said, \"We've got our teeth in the enemy's jugular now, and we're not going to let go.\" \n\nThe CIA created Counter-terrorism Pursuit Teams (CTPT) staffed by Afghans at the war's beginning.   This force grew to over 3,000 by 2010 and was considered one of the \"best Afghan fighting forces\". Firebase Lilley was one of SAD's nerve centers. These units were not only effective in operations against the Taliban and al-Qaeda forces in Afghanistan, but have expanded their operations into Pakistan. They were also important factors in both the \"counterterrorism plus\" and the full \"counter-insurgency\" options discussed by the Obama administration in the December 2010 review.\n\nWikiLeaks disclosure\n\nOn 25 July 2010, the release of 91,731 classified documents from the WikiLeaks organization was made public. The documents cover U.S. military incident and intelligence reports from January 2004 to December 2009.  Some of these documents included sanitised, and \"covered up\", accounts of civilian casualties caused by Coalition Forces. The reports included many references to other incidents involving civilian casualties like the Kunduz airstrike and Nangar Khel incident.  The leaked documents also contain reports of Pakistan collusion with the Taliban. According to Der Spiegel, \"the documents clearly show that the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (usually known as the ISI) is the most important accomplice the Taliban has outside of Afghanistan.\" \n\nPakistan and U.S. tensions\n\nTensions between Pakistan and the U.S. were heightened in late September after several Pakistan Frontier Corps soldiers were killed and wounded. The troops were attacked by a U.S. piloted aircraft that was pursuing Taliban forces near the Afghan-Pakistan border, but for unknown reasons opened fire on two Pakistan border posts. In retaliation for the strike, Pakistan closed the Torkham ground border crossing to NATO supply convoys for an unspecified period. This incident followed the release of a video allegedly showing uniformed Pakistan soldiers executing unarmed civilians.  After the Torkham border closing, Pakistani Taliban attacked NATO convoys, killing several drivers and destroying around 100 tankers. \n\n2011: U.S. and NATO drawdown\n\nBattle of Kandahar\n\nThe Battle of Kandahar was part of an offensive named after the Battle of Bad'r that took place on 13 March 624, between Medina and Mecca. The Battle followed a 30 April announcement that the Taliban would launch their Spring offensive. \n\nOn 7 May the Taliban launched a major offensive on government buildings in Kandahar. The Taliban said their goal was to take control of the city. At least eight locations were attacked: the governor's compound, the mayor's office, the NDS headquarters, three police stations and two high schools.  The battle continued onto a second day. The BBC's Bilal Sarwary called it \"the worst attack in Kandahar province since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, and a embarrassment for the Western-backed Afghan government.\" \n\nDeath of Osama bin Laden\n\nOn 2 May U.S. officials announced that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had been killed in Operation Neptune Spear, conducted by the CIA and U.S. Navy SEALs, in Pakistan. Crowds gathered outside the White House chanting \"USA, USA\" after the news emerged. \n\nWithdrawal\n\nOn 22 June President Obama announced that 10,000 troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2011 and an additional 23,000 troops would return by the summer of 2012. After the withdrawal of 10,000 U.S. troops, only 80,000 remained.  In July 2011 Canada withdrew its combat troops, transitioning to a training role.\n\nFollowing suit, other NATO countries announced troop reductions. The United Kingdom stated that it would gradually withdraw its troops, however it did not specify numbers or dates.  France announced that it would withdraw roughly 1,000 soldiers by the end of 2012, with 3,000 soldiers remaining. Hundreds would come back at the end of 2011 and in the beginning of 2012, when the Afghan National Army took control of Surobi district. The remaining troops would continue to operate in Kapisa. Their complete withdrawal was expected by the end of 2014 or earlier given adequate security. \n\nBelgium announced that half of their force would withdraw starting in January 2012.  Norway announced it had started a withdrawal of its near 500 troops and would be completely out by 2014.  Equally, the Spanish Prime Minister announced the withdrawal of troops beginning in 2012, including up to 40 percent by the end of the first half of 2013, and complete withdrawal by 2014. \n\n2011 U.S.–NATO attack in Pakistan\n\nAfter Neptune Spear, ISAF forces accidentally attacked Pakistan's armed forces on 26 November, killing 24 Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan blocked NATO supply lines and ordered Americans to leave Shamsi Airfield. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the attack was 'tragic' and 'unintended'. \"This (regret) is not good enough. We strongly condemn the attacks and reserve the right to take action,\" said DG ISPR Major General Athar Abbas. \"This could have serious consequences in the level and extent of our cooperation. \n\n2012: Strategic agreement\n\nTaliban attacks continued at the same rate as they did in 2011, around 28,000 attacks.  In September 2012, the surge of American personnel that began in late 2009 ended. \n\nReformation of the United Front (Northern Alliance)\n\nIn late 2011 the National Front of Afghanistan (NFA) was created by Ahmad Zia Massoud, Abdul Rashid Dostum and Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq in what many analysts have described as a reformation of the military wing of the United Front (Northern Alliance) to oppose a return of the Taliban to power.  Meanwhile, much of the political wing reunited under the National Coalition of Afghanistan led by Abdullah Abdullah becoming the main democratic opposition movement in the Afghan parliament.   Former head of intelligence Amrullah Saleh has created a new movement, Basej-i Milli (Afghanistan Green Trend), with support among the youth mobilizing about 10,000 people in an anti-Taliban demonstration in Kabul in May 2011.   \n\nIn January 2012, the National Front of Afghanistan raised concerns about the possibility of a secret deal between the US, Pakistan and the Taliban during a widely publicized meeting in Berlin. U.S. Congressman Louie Gohmert wrote, \"These leaders who fought with embedded Special Forces to initially defeat the Taliban represent over 60-percent of the Afghan people, yet are being entirely disregarded by the Obama and Karzai Administrations in negotiations.\"  After the meeting with US congressmen in Berlin the National Front signed a joint declaration stating among other things:\n\nHigh-profile U.S. military incidents\n\nBeginning in January 2012, incidents involving US troops     occurred which were described by The Sydney Morning Herald as \"a series of damaging incidents and disclosures involving US troops in Afghanistan […]\".  These incidents created fractures in the partnership between Afghanistan and ISAF,  raised the question whether discipline within US troops was breaking down,  undermined \"the image of foreign forces in a country where there is already deep resentment owing to civilian deaths and a perception among many Afghans that US troops lack respect for Afghan culture and people\"  and strained the relations between Afghanistan and the United States.  Besides an incident involving US troops who posed with body parts of dead insurgents and a video apparently showing a US helicopter crew singing \"Bye-bye Miss American Pie\" before blasting a group of Afghan men with a Hellfire missile   these \"high-profile U.S. military incidents in Afghanistan\" also included the 2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests and the Panjwai shooting spree.\n\nEnduring Strategic Partnership Agreement\n\nOn 2 May 2012, Presidents Karzai and Obama signed a strategic partnership agreement between the two countries, after the US president had arrived unannounced in Kabul on the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death.  The U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, officially entitled the \"Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the United States of America\",  provides the long-term framework for the two countries' relationship after the drawdown of U.S. forces.  The Strategic Partnership Agreement went into effect on 4 July 2012, according to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on 8 July 2012 at the Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan.  On 7 July 2012, as part of the agreement, the U.S. designated Afghanistan a major non-NATO ally after Karzai and Clinton met in Kabul.  On 11 November 2012, as part of the agreement, the two countries launched negotiations for a bilateral security agreement. \n\nNATO Chicago Summit: Troops withdrawal and long-term presence\n\nOn 21 May 2012 the leaders of NATO-member countries endorsed an exit strategy during the NATO Summit. ISAF Forces would transfer command of all combat missions to Afghan forces by the middle of 2013,  while shifting from combat to advising, training and assisting Afghan security forces.   Most of the 130,000 ISAF troops would depart by the end of December 2014. A new NATO mission would then assume the support role. \n\n2013: Withdrawal\n\nKarzai–Obama meeting\n\nKarzai visited the U.S. in January 2012. At the time the U.S. Government stated its openness to withdrawing all of its troops by the end of 2014.  On 11 January 2012 Karzai and Obama agreed to transfer combat operations from NATO to Afghan forces by spring 2013 rather than summer 2013.   \"What's going to happen this spring is that Afghans will be in the lead throughout the country\", Obama said. \"They [ISAF forces] will still be fighting alongside Afghan troops...We will be in a training, assisting, advising role.\" Obama added He also stated the reason of the withdrawals that \"We achieved our central goal, or have come very close...which is to de-capacitate al-Qaeda, to dismantle them, to make sure that they can't attack us again.\" \n\nObama also stated that he would determine the pace of troop withdrawal after consultations with commanders.  He added that any U.S. mission beyond 2014 would focus solely on counterterrorism operations and training. Obama insisted that a continuing presence must include an immunity agreement in which US troops are not subjected to Afghan law.  \"I can go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a way that Afghan sovereignty will not be compromised, in a way that Afghan law will not be compromised,\" Karzai replied.\n\nBoth leaders agreed that the United States would transfer Afghan prisoners and prisons to the Afghan government and withdraw troops from Afghan villages in spring 2013.   \"The international forces, the American forces, will be no longer present in the villages, that it will be the task of the Afghan forces to provide for the Afghan people in security and protection,\" the Afghan president said.\n\nSecurity transfer\n\nOn 18 June 2013 the transfer of security responsibilities was completed.    The last step was to transfer control of 95 remaining districts. Karzai said, \"When people see security has been transferred to Afghans, they support the army and police more than before.\" NATO leader Rasmussen said that Afghan forces were completing a five-stage transition process that began in March 2011. \"They are doing so with remarkable resolve,\" he said. \"Ten years ago, there were no Afghan national security forces … now you have 350,000 Afghan troops and police.\" ISAF remained slated to end its mission by the end of 2014. Some 100,000 ISAF forces remained in the country. \n\n2014: Withdrawal continues and the insurgency increases\n\nAfter 2013, Afghanistan was shaken hard with suicide bombings by the Taliban. A clear example of this is a bombing of a Lebanese restaurant in the Wazir Akbar Khan area of Kabul on 18 February 2014. Among the dead in this attack was UN staff and the owner of a restaurant, who died protecting his business; 21 people altogether were killed. Meanwhile, the withdrawal continued, with 200 more US troops going home. The UK halved their force and were slowing withdrawal with all but two bases being closed down. On 20 March 2014, more than 4 weeks after a bomb in a military bus by the Taliban rocked the city once again, a raid on the Serena Hotel's restaurant in Kabul by the Taliban resulted in the deaths of 9 people, including the 4 perpetrators. The attack came just 8 days after Swedish radio journalist Nils Horner was shot dead by the Taliban.\n\nDespite the crisis in Crimea, by March 2014 Russia had not tried to exert pressure on the U.S. via the Northern Distribution Network supply line.  On 9 June 2014 a coalition air strike mistakenly killed five U.S. troops, an Afghan National Army member and an interpreter in Zabul Province. \n\nOn 5 August 2014, a gunman in an Afghan military uniform opened fire on a number of U.S., foreign and Afghan soldiers, killing a U.S. general, Harold J. Greene  and wounding about 15 officers and soldiers including a German brigadier general and a large number of U.S. soldiers at Camp Qargha, a training base west of Kabul. \n\nTwo longterm security pacts, the Bilaterial Security agreement between Afghanistan and the United States of America and the NATO Status of Forces Agreement between NATO and Afghanistan, were signed on September 30, 2014. Both pacts lay out the framework for the foreign troop involvement in Afghnistan after the year 2014. \n\nAfter 13 years Britain and the United States officially ended their combat operation in Afghanistan on October 26, 2014. On that day Britain handed over its last base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion, while the United States handed over its last base, Camp Leatherneck, to Afghan forces. \n\nAs early as November 2012, the U.S. and NATO were considering the precise configuration of their post-2014 presence in Afghanistan.   On 27 May 2014, President Barack Obama announced that U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan would end in December 2014 (see Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan). 9,800 troops were to remain, training Afghan security forces and supporting counterterrorism operations against remnants of al-Qaeda. This force would be halved by the end of 2015, and consolidated at Bagram Air Base and in Kabul. All U.S. forces, with the exception of a \"normal embassy presence,\" would be removed from Afghanistan by the end of 2016.  In 2014, 56 United States service members, and 101 contractors, died in Afghanistan. \n\nOn 28 December 2014 NATO officially ended combat operations in a ceremony held in Kabul. Continued operations by United States forces within Afghanistan will continue under the name Operation Freedom's Sentinel;  this was joined by a new NATO mission under the name of Operation Resolute Support.\n* \n* \n* \n Operation Resolute Support, will involve 28 NATO nations, 14 partner nations, eleven thousand American troops, and eight hundred fifty German troops. \n\nThe UK officially commemorated the end of its role in the Afghan war in a ceremony held in St Paul's cathedral on 13 March 2015.\n \n\n2015: Secretive war\n\nAlthough there was a formal end to combat operations, partially because of improved relations between the United States and the Ghani presidency, American forces increased raids against Islamic militants and terrorists, justified by a broad interpretation of protecting American forces.   A joint raid by American and Afghan forces arrested six Taliban connected to the 2014 Peshawar school massacre. \n\nAmerican Secretary of Defense Ash Carter traveled to Afghanistan in February 2015,  during a time in which the slowing of American withdrawal from Afghanistan was discussed.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n  In the same month, the headquarters element of the 7th Infantry Division (United States) began to deploy to Afghanistan;  it was to be joined by the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division (United States), and by the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade.  In March 2015, it was announced that the United States would maintain almost ten thousand service members in Afghanistan until at least the end of 2015, a change from planned reductions.   As of late May 2015, American forces continued to conduct airstrikes and Special Operations raids, while Afghan forces were losing ground to Taliban forces in some regions. \n\nImpact on Afghan society\n\nCivilian casualties\n\nWar casualty estimates vary. According to a UN report, the Taliban were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009.  A UN report in June 2011 stated that 2,777 civilians were known to have been killed in 2010, (insurgents responsible for 75%).  A July 2011 UN report said \"1,462 non-combatants died\" in the first six months of 2011 (insurgents 80%).  In 2011 a record 3,021 civilians were killed, the fifth successive annual rise.  According to a UN report, in 2013 there were 2,959 civilian deaths with 74% being blamed on anti-government forces, 8% on Afghan security forces, 3% on ISAF forces, 10% to ground engagements between anti-Government forces and pro-Government forces and 5% of the deaths were unattributed.  60% of Afghans have direct personal experience and most others report suffering a range of hardships. 96% have been affected either personally or from the wider consequences. \n\nA report titled Body Count put together by Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival and the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict. \n\nAccording to the Watson Institute for International Studies Costs of War Project, 21,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the war. \n\nHealth\n\nAccording to Nicholas Kristoff, improved healthcare resulting from the war has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. \n\nRefugees\n\nSince 2001, more than 5.7 million former refugees have returned to Afghanistan,    but 2.2 million others remained refugees in 2013.  In January 2013 the UN estimated that 547,550 were internally displaced persons, a 25% increase over the 447,547 IDPs estimated for January 2012[http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/afghans-fleeing-war-find-misery-urban-slums-2012-02-23 Afghans fleeing war find misery in urban slums] Feb. 2012, Amnesty International [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/23/afghan-refugees-amnesty-report \"Afghan refugees abandoned by their own government, report finds: About half a million Afghans who fled homes because of violence are living in desperate conditions, says Amnesty\"], The Guardian, 23 February 2012\n\nDrug trade\n\nFrom 1996 to 1999, the Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan's poppy fields and made opium its largest source of revenue. Taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of Taliban income. According to Rashid, \"drug money funded the weapons, ammunition and fuel for the war.\" In The New York Times, the Finance Minister of the United Front, Wahidullah Sabawoon, declared the Taliban had no annual budget but that they \"appeared to spend US$300 million a year, nearly all of it on war\". He added that the Taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money: \"poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden\". \n\nBy 2000 Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world's opium supply and in 2000 produced an estimated 3276 tonnes from 82171 ha.  Omar then banned opium cultivation and production dropped to an estimated 74 metric tonnes from 1685 ha.  Some observers say the ban – which came in a bid for international recognition at the United Nations – was issued only to raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles. 1999 had yielded a record crop and had been followed by a lower but still large 2000 harvest. The trafficking of accumulated stocks continued in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, the UN mentioned the \"existence of significant stocks of opiated accumulated during previous years of bumper harvests\". In September 2001 – before 11 September attacks against the U.S. – the Taliban allegedly authorized Afghan peasants to sow opium again.\n\nSoon after the invasion opium production increased markedly.  By 2005, Afghanistan was producing 90% of the world's opium, most of which was processed into heroin and sold in Europe and Russia.  In 2009, the BBC reported that \"UN findings say an opium market worth $65bn (£39bn) funds global terrorism, caters to 15 million addicts, and kills 100,000 people every year\". \n\nPublic education\n\nAs of 2013, 8.2 million Afghans attended school, including 3.2 million girls, up from 1.2 million in 2001, including fewer than 50,000 girls.  \n\nWar crimes\n\nWar crimes (a serious violation of the laws and customs of war giving rise to individual criminal responsibility)  have been committed by both sides  including civilian massacres, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, use of torture and the murder of prisoners of war. Additional common crimes include theft, arson, and the destruction of property not warranted by military necessity.\n\nTaliban\n\nIn 2011 The New York Times reported that the Taliban was responsible for  of all civilian deaths in the war in Afghanistan.   In 2013 the UN stated that the Taliban had been placing bombs along transit routes. \n\nNorthern Alliance\n\nIn December 2001 the Dasht-i-Leili massacre took place, where between 250 and 3,000 Taliban fighters who had surrendered, were shot and/or suffocated to death in metal truck containers during transportation by Northern Alliance forces. Reports place U.S. ground troops at the scene.  [http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/issues/mass-atrocities/afghanistan-war-crime/dasht-e-leili-photos.html Dasht-e-Leili Photos; Sheberghan Prison and Pit Locations at Dasht-e-Leili], Physicians for Human Rights, Retrieved 19 February 2012 The Irish documentary Afghan Massacre: The Convoy of Death investigated these allegations and claimed that mass graves of thousands of victims were found by UN investigators  and that the US blocked investigations into the incident. \n\nCoalition\n\nOn 21 June 2003, David Passaro, a CIA contractor and former United States Army Ranger, killed Abdul Wali, a prisoner at a U.S. base 10 mi south of Asadabad, in Kunar Province. Passaro was found guilty of one count of felony assault with a dangerous weapon and three counts of misdemeanor assault. On 10 August 2009, he was sentenced to 8 years and 4 months in prison.  \n\nIn 2002, two unarmed civilian Afghan prisoners were tortured and later killed by U.S. armed forces personnel at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility (also Bagram Collection Point or B.C.P.) in Bagram, Afghanistan.  The prisoners, Habibullah and Dilawar, were chained to the ceiling and beaten, which caused their deaths.  Military coroners ruled that both the prisoners' deaths were homicides.  Autopsies revealed severe trauma to both prisoners' legs, describing the trauma as comparable to being run over by a bus. Fifteen soldiers were charged.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, ISAF charged five United States Army soldiers with the murder of three Afghan civilians in Kandahar province and collecting their body parts as trophies in what came to be known as the Maywand District murders. In addition, seven soldiers were charged with crimes such as hashish use, impeding an investigation and attacking the whistleblower, Specialist Justin Stoner.  Eleven of the twelve soldiers were convicted on various counts. \n\nA British Royal Marine Sergeant, identified as Sergeant Alexander Blackman from Taunton, Somerset,  was convicted at court martial in Wiltshire of having murdered an unarmed, reportedly wounded Afghan fighter in Helmand Province in September 2011.  In 2013, he received a life sentence from the court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, and was dismissed with disgrace from the Royal Marines.  \n\nOn 11 March 2012, the Kandahar massacre occurred when sixteen civilians were killed and six wounded in the Panjwayi District of Kandahar Province, Afghanistan.   Nine of the victims were children, and eleven of the dead were from the same family.  United States Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales was taken into custody and charged with sixteen counts of premeditated murder. After pleading guilty to sixteen counts of premeditated murder, Bales was sentenced to life in prison without parole and dishonourably discharged from the United States Army. \n\nCosts\n\nThe cost of the war reportedly was a major factor as U.S. officials considered drawing down troops in 2011.  A March 2011 Congressional Research Service report noted, 1) following the Afghanistan surge announcement in 2009, Defense Department spending on Afghanistan increased by 50%, going from $4.4 billion to $6.7 billion a month. During that time, troop strength increased from 44,000 to 84,000, and was expected to be at 102,000 for fiscal year 2011; 2) The total cost from inception to the fiscal year 2011 was expected to be $468 billion.  The estimate for the cost of deploying one U.S. soldier in Afghanistan is over US$1 million a year. \n\nStability problems\n\nIn a 2008 interview, the then-head U.S. Central Command General David H. Petraeus, insisted that the Taliban were gaining strength. He cited a recent increase in attacks in Afghanistan and in neighboring Pakistan. Petraeus insisted that the problems in Afghanistan were more complicated than the ones he had faced in Iraq during his tour and required removing widespread sanctuaries and strongholds. \n\nObservers have argued that the mission in Afghanistan is hampered by a lack of agreement on objectives, a lack of resources, lack of coordination, too much focus on the central government at the expense of local and provincial governments, and too much focus on the country instead of the region. \n\nIn 2009, Afghanistan moved three places in Transparency International's annual index of corruption, becoming the world's second most-corrupt country just ahead of Somalia.  In the same month, Malalai Joya, a former member of the Afghan Parliament and the author of \"Raising My Voice\", expressed opposition to an expansion of the U.S. military presence and her concerns about the future. \"Eight years ago, the U.S. and NATO – under the banner of women's rights, human rights, and democracy – occupied my country and pushed us from the frying pan into the fire. Eight years is enough to know better about the corrupt, mafia system of President Hamid Karzai. My people are crushed between two powerful enemies. From the sky, occupation forces bomb and kill civilians … and on the ground, the Taliban and warlords continue their crimes. It is better that they leave my country; my people are that fed up. Occupation will never bring liberation, and it is impossible to bring democracy by war.\" \n\nPakistan plays a central role in the conflict. A 2010 report published by the London School of Economics says that Pakistan's ISI has an \"official policy\" of support to the Taliban.  \"Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude,\" the report states. Amrullah Saleh, former director of Afghanistan's intelligence service, stated, \"We talk about all these proxies [Taliban, Haqqanis] but not the master of proxies, which is the Pakistan army. The question is what does Pakistan's army want to achieve …? They want to gain influence in the region\"  About the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan he stated: \"[T]hey fight for the U.S. national interest but … without them we will face massacre and disaster and God knows what type of a future Afghanistan will have.\" \n\nAfghan security forces\n\nAfghan National Army\n\nU.S. policy called for boosting the Afghan National Army to 134,000 soldiers by October 2010. By May 2010 the Afghan Army had accomplished this interim goal and was on track to reach its ultimate number of 171,000 by 2011.  This increase in Afghan troops allowed the U.S. to begin withdrawing its forces in July 2011.  \n\nIn 2010, the Afghan National Army had limited fighting capacity. Even the best Afghan units lacked training, discipline and adequate reinforcements. In one new unit in Baghlan Province, soldiers had been found cowering in ditches rather than fighting.  Some were suspected of collaborating with the Taliban. \"They don't have the basics, so they lay down,\" said Capt. Michael Bell, who was one of a team of U.S. and Hungarian mentors tasked with training Afghan soldiers. \"I ran around for an hour trying to get them to shoot, getting fired on. I couldn't get them to shoot their weapons.\" In addition, 9 out of 10 soldiers in the Afghan National Army were illiterate. \n\nThe Afghan Army was plagued by inefficiency and endemic corruption.  U.S. training efforts were drastically slowed by the problems.  U.S. trainers reported missing vehicles, weapons and other military equipment, and outright theft of fuel.  Death threats were leveled against U.S. officers who tried to stop Afghan soldiers from stealing. Afghan soldiers often snipped the command wires of IEDs instead of marking them and waiting for U.S. forces to come to detonate them. This allowed insurgents to return and reconnect them. U.S. trainers frequently removed the cell phones of Afghan soldiers hours before a mission for fear that the operation would be compromised.  American trainers often spent large amounts of time verifying that Afghan rosters were accurate – that they are not padded with \"ghosts\" being \"paid\" by Afghan commanders who stole the wages. \n\nDesertion was a significant problem. One in every four combat soldiers quit the Afghan Army during the 12-month period ending in September 2009, according to data from the U.S. Defense Department and the Inspector General for Reconstruction in Afghanistan. \n\nAfghan National Police\n\nThe Afghan National Police provides support to the Afghan army. Police officers in Afghanistan are also largely illiterate. Approximately 17 percent of them tested positive for illegal drugs in 2010. They were widely accused of demanding bribes.  Attempts to build a credible Afghan police force were faltering badly, according to NATO officials.  A quarter of the officers quit every year, making the Afghan government's goals of substantially building up the police force even harder to achieve.\n\nInsider attacks\n\nBeginning in 2011, insurgent forces in Afghanistan began using a tactic of insider attacks on ISAF and Afghan military forces. In the attacks, Taliban personnel or sympathizers belonging to, or pretending to belong to, the Afghan military or police forces attack ISAF personnel, often within the security of ISAF military bases and Afghan government facilities. In 2011, for example, 21 insider attacks killed 35 coalition personnel. Forty-six insider attacks killed 63 and wounded 85 coalition troops, mostly American, in the first 11 months of 2012.  The attacks continued but began diminishing towards the planned 31 December 2014 ending of combat operations in Afghanistan by ISAF. However, on 5 August 2014, a gunman in an Afghan military uniform opened fire on a number of international military personnel, killing a U.S. general and wounding about 15 officers and soldiers, including a German brigadier general and 8 U.S. troops, at a training base west of Kabul.\n\nReactions\n\nDomestic reactions\n\nPolls of Afghans displayed strong opposition to the Taliban and significant support of the U.S. military presence. However the idea of permanent U.S. military bases was not popular in 2005. \n\nAccording to a May 2009 BBC poll, 69% of Afghans surveyed thought it was at least mostly good that the U.S. military came in to remove the Taliban – a decrease from 87% of Afghans surveyed in 2005. 24% thought it was mostly or very bad – up from 9% in 2005. The poll indicated that 63% of Afghans were at least somewhat supportive of a U.S. military presence in the country – down from 78% in 2005. Just 18% supported increasing the U.S. military's presence, while 44% favored reducing it. 90% of Afghans surveyed opposed the Taliban, including 70% who were strongly opposed. By an 82%–4% margin, people said they preferred the current government to Taliban rule. \n\nIn a June 2009 Gallup survey, about half of Afghan respondents felt that additional U.S. forces would help stabilize the security situation in the southern provinces. But opinions varied widely; residents in the troubled South were mostly mixed or uncertain, while those in the West largely disagreed that more U.S. troops would help the situation. \n\nIn December 2009, many Afghan tribal heads and local leaders from the south and east called for U.S. troop withdrawals. \"I don't think we will be able to solve our problems with military force,\" said Muhammad Qasim, a Kandahar tribal elder. \"We can solve them by providing jobs and development and by using local leaders to negotiate with the Taliban.\"  \"If new troops come and are stationed in civilian areas, when they draw Taliban attacks civilians will end up being killed,\" said Gulbadshah Majidi, a lawmaker and close associate of Mr. Karzai. \"This will only increase the distance between Afghans and their government.\" \n\nIn late January 2010, Afghan protesters took to the streets for three straight days and blocked traffic on a highway that links Kabul and Kandahar. The Afghans were demonstrating in response to the deaths of four men in a NATO-Afghan raid in the village of Ghazni. Ghazni residents insisted that the dead were civilians. \n\nInternational reactions\n\nPublic opinion in 2001\n\nWhen the invasion began in October 2001, polls indicated that about 88% of Americans and about 65% of Britons backed military action.\n\nA large-scale 37-nation poll of world opinion carried out by Gallup International in late September 2001 found that large majorities in most countries favored a legal response, in the form of extradition and trial, over a military response to 9/11: only three countries out of the 37 surveyed – the U.S., Israel and India – did majorities favor military action. In the other 34 countries surveyed, the poll found many clear majorities that favored extradition and trial instead of military action: in the United Kingdom (75%), France (67%), Switzerland (87%), Czech Republic (64%), Lithuania (83%), Panama (80%) and Mexico (94%).  \n\nAn Ipsos-Reid poll conducted between November and December 2001 showed that majorities in Canada (66%), France (60%), Germany (60%), Italy (58%), and the UK (65%) approved of US airstrikes while majorities in Argentina (77%), China (52%), South Korea (50%), Spain (52%), and Turkey (70%) opposed them.\n\nDevelopment of public opinion\n\nIn a 47-nation June 2007 survey of global public opinion, the Pew Global Attitudes Project found international opposition to the war. Out of the 47 countries surveyed, 4 had a majority that favoured keeping foreign troops: the U.S. (50%), Israel (59%), Ghana (50%), and Kenya (60%). In 41, pluralities wanted NATO troops out as soon as possible.  In 32 out of 47, clear majorities wanted war over as soon as possible. Majorities in 7 out of 12 NATO member countries said troops should be withdrawn as soon as possible. \n\nA 24-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2008 similarly found that majorities or pluralities in 21 of 24 countries want the U.S. and NATO to remove their troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible. Only in three out of the 24 countries – the U.S. (50%), Australia (60%), and Britain (48%) – did public opinion lean more toward keeping troops there until the situation has stabilized.  \n\nFollowing that June 2008 global survey, however, public opinion in Australia and Britain diverged from that in the U.S. A majority of Australians and Britons now want their troops home. A September 2008 poll found that 56% of Australians opposed continuation of their country's military involvement.    A November 2008 poll found that 68% of Britons wanted their troops withdrawn within the next 12 months.   \n\nIn the U.S., a September 2008 Pew survey found that 61% of Americans wanted U.S. troops to stay until the situation has stabilized, while 33% wanted them removed as soon as possible.  Public opinion was divided over Afghan troop requests: a majority of Americans continued to see a rationale for the use of military force in Afghanistan.  A slight plurality of Americans favored troop increases, with 42%–47% favoring some troop increases, 39%–44% wanting reduction, and 7–9% wanting no changes. Just 29% of Democrats favored troop increases while 57% wanted to begin reducing troops. Only 36% of Americans approved of Obama's handling of Afghanistan, including 19% of Republicans, 31% of independents, and 54% of Democrats. \n\nIn a December 2009 Pew Research Center poll, only 32 percent of Americans favored increasing U.S. troops in Afghanistan, while 40 percent favored decreasing them. Almost half of Americans, 49 percent, believed that the U.S. should \"mind its own business\" internationally and let other countries get along the best they can. That figure was an increase from 30 percent who said that in December 2002. \n\nAn April 2011 Pew Research Center poll showed little change in American views, with about 50% saying that the effort was going very well or fairly well and only 44% supporting NATO troop presence in Afghanistan. \n\nProtests, demonstrations and rallies\n\nThe war has been the subject of large protests around the world starting with the large-scale demonstrations in the days leading up to the invasion and every year since. Many protesters consider the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan to be unjustified aggression.   The deaths of Afghan civilians caused directly and indirectly by the U.S. and NATO bombing campaigns is a major underlying focus of the protests.  In January 2009, Brave New Foundation launched Rethink Afghanistan, a national campaign for non-violent solutions in Afghanistan built around a documentary film by director and political activist Robert Greenwald.  Dozens of organizations planned (and eventually held) a national march for peace in Washington, D.C. on 20 March 2010.  \n\nHuman rights abuses\n\nMultiple accounts document human rights violations in Afghanistan. \n\nTaliban\n\nAccording to a report by the United Nations, the Taliban were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIGRC) called the Taliban's terrorism against the Afghan civilian population a war crime. According to Amnesty International, the Taliban commit war crimes by targeting civilians, including killing teachers, abducting aid workers and burning school buildings. Amnesty International said that up to 756 civilians were killed in 2006 by bombs, mostly on roads or carried by suicide attackers belonging to the Taliban. \n\nNATO has alleged that the Taliban have used civilians as human shields. As an example, NATO pointed to the victims of NATO air strikes in Farah province in May 2009, during which the Afghan government claims up to 150 civilians were killed. NATO stated it had evidence the Taliban forced civilians into buildings likely to be targeted by NATO aircraft involved in the battle. A spokesman for the ISAF commander said: \"This was a deliberate plan by the Taliban to create a civilian casualty crisis. These were not human shields; these were human sacrifices. We have intelligence that points to this.\"  according to the U.S. State Department, the Taliban committed human rights violations against women in Afghanistan. \n\nWhite phosphorus use\n\nWhite phosphorus has been condemned by human rights organizations as cruel and inhumane because it causes severe burns. White phosphorus burns on the bodies of civilians wounded in clashes near Bagram were confirmed. The U.S. claims at least 44 instances in which militants have used white phosphorus in weapons or attacks.  In May 2009, the U.S. confirmed that Western military forces in Afghanistan use white phosphorus to illuminate targets or as an incendiary to destroy bunkers and enemy equipment.   US forces used white phosphorus to screen a retreat in the Battle of Ganjgal when regular smoke munitions were not available. \n\nEnvironmental legacy\n\nSince 1979 landmines, shells, bombs, and other unexploded ordnance have been left behind.\nIn 2015 the NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was replaced by the US-led \"Resolute Support\" The director of the Mine Action Coordination Centre for Afghanistan (MACCA). ISAF stressed it had never used landmines."

Though there were nearly three dozen member states of the coalition, the overwhelming majority of the military forces participating were from the United States, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order.\nThe Iraq War, also known as the Second Persian Gulf War, the Occupation of Iraq, or Operation Iraqi Freedom, is an ongoing military campaign which began on March 20th, 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a multinational force now led by and composed almost entirely of troops from the United States and United Kingdom.\nThe War in Afghanistan is an ongoing coalition conflict which began on October 7th, 2001, as the US military's Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) that was launched, along with the British military, in response to the September 11th, 2001 attacks on the US. The UK has, since 2002, led its own military operation, Operation Herrick, as part of the same war in Afghanistan. The character of the war evolved from a violent struggle against Al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters to a complex counterinsurgency effort.\nSort By:",

                "Afghanistan War | 2001-2014 | Britannica.com\nAfghanistan War\nUnited States\nAfghanistan War, international conflict in Afghanistan beginning in 2001 that was triggered by the September 11 attacks and consisted of three phases. The first phase—toppling the Taliban (the ultraconservative political and religious faction that ruled Afghanistan and provided sanctuary for al-Qaeda , perpetrators of the September 11 attacks)—was brief, lasting just two months. The second phase, from 2002 until 2008, was marked by a U.S. strategy of defeating the Taliban militarily and rebuilding core institutions of the Afghan state. The third phase, a turn to classic counterinsurgency doctrine, began in 2008 and accelerated with U.S. Pres. Barack Obama ’s 2009 decision to temporarily increase the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan. The larger force was used to implement a strategy of protecting the population from Taliban attacks and supporting efforts to reintegrate insurgents into Afghan society. The strategy came coupled with a timetable for the withdrawal of the foreign forces from Afghanistan; beginning in 2011, security responsibilities would be gradually handed over to the Afghan military and police. The new approach largely failed to achieve its aims. Insurgent attacks and civilian casualties remained stubbornly high, while many of the Afghan military and police units taking over security duties appeared to be ill-prepared to hold off the Taliban. By the time the U.S. and NATO combat mission formally ended in December 2014, the 13-year Afghanistan War had become the longest war ever fought by the United States.\nU.S. Army soldiers on security duty in Paktīkā province, Afghanistan, 2010.\nSgt. Derec Pierson/U.S. Department of Defense\nPrelude to the September 11 attacks\nThe joint U.S. and British invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001 was preceded by over two decades of war in Afghanistan. On Dec. 24, 1979, Soviet tanks rumbled across the Amu Darya River and into Afghanistan, ostensibly to restore stability following a coup that brought to power a pair of Marxist-Leninist political groups—the People’s (Khalq) Party and the Banner (Parcham) Party. But the Soviet presence touched off a nationwide rebellion by Islamist fighters, who won extensive covert backing from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia , and the United States and who were joined in their fight by foreign volunteers. The guerrilla war against the Soviet forces led to their departure a decade later (see Afghan War ). In the void, civil war reigned, with the Islamist fighters—known as the mujahideen —battling first to oust the Soviet-backed government and then turning their guns on each other.\nA convoy of Soviet armoured vehicles crossing a bridge at the Soviet-Afghan border, May 21, 1988, …\nVitaly Armand—AFP/Getty Images\nWar of 1812\nIn 1996 the Taliban seized Kabul and instituted a severe interpretation of Islamic law that, for example, forbade female education and prescribed the severing of hands, or even execution, as punishment for petty crimes. That same year, al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was welcomed to Afghanistan (having been expelled from Sudan) and established his organization’s headquarters there. With al-Qaeda’s help, the Taliban won control of over 90 percent of Afghan territory by the summer of 2001. On September 9 of that year, al-Qaeda hit men carried out the assassination of famed mujahideen leader Ahmad Shah Massoud , who at the time was leading the Northern Alliance (a loose coalition of mujahideen militias that maintained control of a small section of northern Afghanistan) as it battled the Taliban and who had unsuccessfully sought greater U.S. backing for his efforts.\nOsama bin Laden sitting on the floor with an AKS-74U rifle, 2001.\nAUSAF/AFP/Getty Images\nThe September 11 attacks and the U.S.- British invasion\nThe hijacking and crashing of four U.S. jetliners on Sept. 11, 2001, brought instant attention to Afghanistan. The plot had been hatched by al-Qaeda, and some of the 19 hijackers had trained in Afghanistan. In the aftermath of the attacks, the administration of U.S. Pres. George W. Bush coalesced around a strategy of first ousting the Taliban from Afghanistan and dismantling al-Qaeda, though others contemplated actions in Iraq , including long-standing plans for toppling Pres. Ṣaddām Ḥussein . Bush demanded that Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar “deliver to [the] United States authorities all the leaders of al-Qaeda who hide in your land,” and when Omar refused, U.S. officials began implementing a plan for war.\nBritannica Stories\nRingling Bros. Folds Its Tent\nThe campaign in Afghanistan started covertly on September 26, with a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) team known as Jawbreaker arriving in the country and, working with anti-Taliban allies, initiating a strategy for overthrowing the regime. U.S. officials hoped that by partnering with the Afghans they could avoid deploying a large force to Afghanistan. Pentagon officials were especially concerned that the United States not be drawn into a protracted occupation of Afghanistan, as had occurred with the Soviets more than two decades prior. The United States relied primarily on the Northern Alliance , which had just lost Massoud but had regrouped under other commanders, including Tajik leader Mohammed Fahim and Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek . The Americans also teamed with anti-Taliban Pashtuns in southern Afghanistan, including a little-known tribal leader named Hamid Karzai .\nUSA Facts\nThe CIA team was soon joined by U.S. and British special forces contingents , and together they provided arms, equipment, and advice to the Afghans. They also helped coordinate targeting for the air campaign, which began on Oct. 7, 2001, with U.S. and British war planes pounding Taliban targets, thus marking the public start of Operation Enduring Freedom. In late October, Northern Alliance forces began to overtake a series of towns formerly held by the Taliban. The forces worked with U.S. assistance, but they defied U.S. wishes when, on November 13, they marched into Kabul as the Taliban retreated without a fight.\nKandahar , the largest city in southern Afghanistan and the Taliban’s spiritual home, fell on December 6, marking the end of Taliban power. It had been besieged by a force led by Karzai that moved in from the north and one commanded by Gul Agha Sherzai that advanced from the south; both operated with heavy assistance from the United States . As the Taliban leadership retreated into Afghanistan’s rural areas and across the border to Pakistan , anti-Taliban figures convened at a United Nations (UN)-sponsored conference in Bonn, Ger. With behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the United States, Karzai was selected to lead the country on an interim basis.\nConnect with Britannica\nFacebook Twitter YouTube Instagram Pinterest\nAn intensive manhunt for Omar, bin Laden , and al-Qaeda deputy chief Ayman al-Zawahiri was undertaken. Prior to the killing of bin Laden by U.S. forces in 2011 (see below), the Americans were believed to have come closest to bin Laden in the December 2001 battle of Tora Bora (bin Laden’s mountain stronghold). But bin Laden was thought to have managed to have slipped into Pakistan with the help of Afghan and Pakistani forces that were supposedly helping the Americans. Critics later questioned why the U.S. military had allowed Afghan forces to lead the assault on the cave complex at Tora Bora rather than doing it themselves. (Indeed, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry made this criticism repeatedly during the 2004 general election campaign.) Al-Qaeda subsequently reestablished its base of operations in the tribal areas that form Pakistan’s northwest border with Afghanistan. Omar and his top Taliban lieutenants settled in and around the Pakistani city of Quetta , in the remote southwestern province of Balochistān . One of the final major battles of the first phase of the war came in March 2002 with Operation Anaconda in the eastern province of Paktia, which involved U.S. and Afghan forces fighting some 800 al-Qaeda and Taliban militants. The operation also marked the entrance of other countries’ troops into the war: special operations forces from Australia , Canada, Denmark , France, Germany , and Norway participated.\nIraq takes centre stage\nWith the ouster of the Taliban and al-Qaeda, the international focus shifted to reconstruction and nation-building efforts in Afghanistan. In April 2002 Bush announced a “Marshall Plan” for Afghanistan in a speech at the Virginia Military Institute , promising substantial financial assistance. But from the start, development efforts in Afghanistan were inadequately funded, as attention had turned among U.S. officials to the looming confrontation in Iraq. Between 2001 and 2009, just over $38 billion in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan was appropriated by the U.S. Congress. More than half the money went to training and equipping Afghan security forces, and the remainder represented a fraction of the amount that experts said would be required to develop a country that had consistently ranked near the bottom of global human development indices. The aid program was also bedeviled by waste and by confusion over whether civilian or military authorities had responsibility for leading education, health, agriculture, and other development projects.\nBritannica Lists & Quizzes\nEditor Picks: Exploring 10 Types of Basketball Movies\nDespite military commitments from dozens of U.S. allies, the United States initially argued against allowing the other foreign forces—operating as the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)—to deploy beyond the Kabul area. That choice was directed by the Pentagon, which insisted on a “light footprint” out of concern that Afghanistan would become a drag on U.S. resources as attention shifted to Iraq (see Iraq War ). When ISAF did begin to venture beyond Kabul, its efforts were hampered by the “caveats” of its component countries—restrictions that kept all but a handful of the militaries from actively engaging in the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The force, overseen by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the organization’s first mission outside Europe, was also hamstrung by a lack of troops as international commitments to Afghanistan flagged.\nThe United States consistently represented the largest foreign force in Afghanistan, and it bore the heaviest losses. By spring 2010 more than 1,000 U.S. troops had been killed in Afghanistan, while the British troops suffered some 300 deaths and the Canadians some 150. Both Britain and Canada stationed their troops in Afghanistan’s south, where fighting had been most intense. More than 20 other countries also lost troops during the war, though many—such as Germany and Italy—chose to focus their forces in the north and the west, where the insurgency was less potent. As the fighting dragged on and casualties escalated, the war lost popularity in many Western countries, creating domestic political pressure to keep troops out of harm’s way or to pull them out altogether.\nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper addressing Canadian soldiers at their base in Kandahar, …\nAP\nEyjafjallajökull volcano\nInitially the war appeared to have been won with relative ease. On May 1, 2003, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced an end to “major combat” in Afghanistan. On the same day, aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, President Bush announced that “major combat operations in Iraq have ended.” At that time, there were 8,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The first democratic Afghan elections since the fall of the Taliban were held on Oct. 9, 2004, with approximately 80 percent of registered voters turning out to give Karzai a full five-year term as president. Parliamentary elections were staged a year later, with dozens of women claiming seats set aside for them to ensure gender diversity . The 2004 constitution provided Afghanistan with a powerful central government and weak regional and local authorities—a structure that was in opposition to the country’s long-standing traditions.\nDespite vast powers under the constitution, Karzai was widely regarded as a weak leader who grew increasingly isolated as the war progressed. He survived several assassination attempts—including a September 2004 rocket attack that nearly struck a helicopter he was riding in—and security concerns kept him largely confined to the presidential palace in Kabul. Karzai’s government was beset by corruption, and efforts to build a national army and a police force were troubled from the start by inadequate international support and ethnic differences between Afghans.\nTaliban resurgence\nBeginning in 2005, violence climbed as the Taliban reasserted its presence with new tactics modeled on those being used by insurgents in Iraq. Whereas early in the war the Taliban had focused on battling U.S. and NATO forces in open combat—a strategy that largely failed to inflict significant damage—their adoption of the use of suicide bombings and buried bombs, known as IEDs ( improvised explosive device s), began to cause heavy casualties. Between January 2005 and August 2006, Afghanistan endured 64 suicide attacks—a tactic that had been virtually unknown in the country’s history before then. At first the attacks caused relatively few casualties, but as training and the availability of high-powered explosives increased, the death toll began to climb: in one particularly vicious attack in November 2007, at least 70 people—many of them children—were killed as a parliamentary delegation visited the northern town of Baghlan . Less than a year later, a bombing at the Indian embassy in Kabul killed more than 50; the Afghan government accused elements of Pakistan’s intelligence service of complicity in the attack, a charge Pakistan denied.\nAn Afghan policeman consoling a relative of the provincial governor who was killed along with three …\nRafiq Maqbool/AP\nThe Taliban’s resurgence corresponded with a rise in anti-American and anti-Western sentiment among Afghans. Those feelings were nurtured by the sluggish pace of reconstruction, allegations of prisoner abuse at U.S. detention facilities, widespread corruption in the Afghan government, and civilian casualties caused by U.S. and NATO bombings. In May 2006 a U.S. military vehicle crashed and killed several Afghans, an event that sparked violent anti-American riots in Kabul—the worst since the war began. Later that year NATO took command of the war across the country; American officials said that the United States would play a lesser role and that the face of the war would become increasingly international. This shift reflected the greater need for U.S. troops and resources in Iraq, where sectarian warfare was reaching alarming levels. By contrast, the war in Afghanistan was still regarded in Washington as a relative success.\nFor commanders on the ground in Afghanistan, however, it was apparent that the Taliban intended to escalate its campaign. The Taliban was earning ample money through donations from wealthy individuals and groups in the Persian Gulf and from the booming opium trade. While poppy cultivation had been dramatically curbed during the Taliban’s final year in power, the group pushed to revive cultivation as a means of funding its insurgency. Western-backed campaigns to eliminate poppy cultivation or to encourage farmers to grow other crops had little discernible impact; Afghanistan soon became the supplier of over 90 percent of the world’s opium.\nAfghan policemen destroying opium poppies during an eradication sweep in Orūzgān …\nAP\nThe United States, meanwhile, had had only limited success in killing or capturing Taliban commanders. In early 2007, Mullah Obaidullah Akhund—the Taliban’s number three leader—was captured in Pakistan, and months later Mullah Dadullah—the Taliban’s top military commander—was killed in fighting with U.S. forces. But those were the exceptions. Top insurgent leaders remained at large, many of them in the tribal regions of Pakistan that adjoin Afghanistan. This reality prompted the United States to begin targeting insurgent leaders who lived in Pakistan with missiles fired from remotely piloted drones (see unmanned aerial vehicle ). The CIA program of targeted killings was publicly denied by U.S. officials but was widely acknowledged in private. Pakistani officials in turn denounced the strikes in public but privately approved of them as long as civilian casualties were limited. The United States repeatedly threatened to expand its drone strikes beyond Pakistan’s tribal areas and into regions such as Balochistān if Pakistan did not demonstrate greater cooperation in battling the Taliban, a group it had long fostered.\nThe Obama surge\nU.S. Pres. Barack Obama went to the White House promising to focus attention and resources on the faltering war effort in Afghanistan. On Feb. 17, 2009, he approved sending an additional 17,000 U.S. troops, on top of the 36,000 U.S. troops and 32,000 NATO service members already there. Three months later Obama took the rare step of removing a commanding general from a theatre of war, replacing Gen. David McKiernan with Gen. Stanley McChrystal . While McKiernan was shifting U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, Obama and other top officials had concluded that a more radical change was needed. McChrystal was brought in to implement a new strategy modeled after the surge strategy in Iraq—one in which U.S. forces would focus on protecting the population from insurgents rather than simply trying to kill large numbers of militants. The strategy also involved trying to persuade enemy fighters to defect and ultimately encouraging reconciliation between the Karzai government and Taliban leaders.\nU.S. Pres. Barack Obama meeting at the White House with Pres. Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Pres. …\nGerald Herbert/AP\nAn Afghan man riding a bicycle on a dirt road during a security patrol by U.S. Marines and Afghan …\nStaff Sgt. William Greeson, U.S. Marine Corps/U.S. Department of Defense\nSoon after assuming command, McChrystal concluded that he did not have enough troops to execute the new strategy, and in September 2009 he laid out his concerns in a confidential report, which was subsequently leaked to the press. McChrystal predicted that the war would be lost within a year if there was not a significant troop surge. After an intensive Afghan policy review—the second one by the Obama administration in less than a year—the president delivered a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point on December 1 in which he announced a major escalation in the war effort, with 30,000 additional troops being deployed to Afghanistan by the summer of 2010. The new strategy led to an increase in U.S. combat deaths; notably, during the first three months of 2010, U.S. deaths were approximately twice what they had been over the same period in 2009.\nA U.S. soldier calling for an air strike on the hills surrounding Barge Matal in eastern …\nSgt. Matthew C. Moeller, U.S. Army/U.S. Department of Defense\nThe surge in U.S. forces was accompanied by a dramatic escalation of U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan—one of which killed Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud. But the CIA also paid a price in late December 2009 when an al-Qaeda double agent detonated a suicide bomb at a Bagram air base in the eastern province of Khost, killing seven from the agency.\nIn early 2010 the surge began with an assault on the insurgent-held town of Marja, in the southern province of Helmand. U.S. Marines achieved a relatively quick victory, even as McChrystal planned a more ambitious offensive in Kandahar . Obama visited Afghanistan for the first time as president on March 28, delivering a stern message to Karzai that he needed to clean up corruption in his government. Karzai had won a new five-year term in an August 2009 election that was tainted by widespread allegations of fraud. Karzai vowed in his inaugural address to stamp out corruption in his government, but there were few signs in the short term that he had done so.\nMeanwhile, Karzai announced that he would attempt to reconcile with the Taliban; he repeatedly invited Mullah Omar to meet with him, but the Taliban leader steadfastly refused. Under intense pressure from the United States, Karzai lashed out in April 2010 and even threatened to join the Taliban if the international community did not stop meddling in Afghan affairs. Troubled by the comments, the White House threatened to revoke Karzai’s invitation to meet with Obama in Washington, D.C. , but the visit occurred as scheduled, with Karzai and Obama at least outwardly making efforts to mend their relationship.\nPakistan offered to mediate Afghan peace talks, but Pakistan’s ultimate attitude toward the Taliban remained a matter of great controversy. In February 2010, Pakistani security forces arrested the Afghan Taliban’s second-in-command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a move interpreted by many U.S. officials as a reflection of Pakistan’s desire to work with the U.S. and Afghan governments to stem the group’s influence. But others, including Kai Eide, the former top UN official in Kabul, said Baradar had been a leading Taliban proponent of reconciliation and that the arrest was intended to scuttle efforts to end the war through a political, rather than military, solution.\nThe military command structure in Afghanistan abruptly changed again in June 2010, when Obama replaced McChrystal with Gen. David Petraeus after McChrystal and some of his aides made disparaging remarks to a Rolling Stone magazine reporter about Obama and other top administration officials, including Vice Pres. Joe Biden , National Security Advisor James L. Jones , and special representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke . The comments underscored festering tensions between U.S. military commanders in Afghanistan and some members of the Obama administration’s civilian leadership. In explaining the change of command, Obama said, “I welcome debate among my team, but I won’t tolerate division.” Despite the switch, Obama vowed that U.S. strategy in Afghanistan would not change. Petraeus, considered the leading architect of counterinsurgency doctrine in the U.S. military, was expected to continue McChrystal’s emphasis on protecting the Afghan population from insurgents, building Afghan government institutions, and seeking to limit civilian casualties.\nGriff Witte The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica\nShortly after McChrystal’s dismissal, a cache of classified documents relating to the Afghanistan War was published online by the whistle-blowing journalistic organization WikiLeaks and prereleased to several newspapers, including The New York Times , Der Spiegel , and The Guardian . The information was mainly in the form of raw intelligence gathered between 2004 and 2009, and WikiLeaks cumulatively termed it the “Afghan War Diary.” It detailed previously unreported civilian deaths, indicated that a U.S. special forces unit was tasked with capturing or killing the persons on a list of insurgent leaders, revealed that the Taliban had employed heat-seeking missiles against aircraft, and suggested that the Pakistani intelligence service had been working with Taliban forces in spite of substantial U.S. aid to Pakistan for its assistance in combating militants. The U.S. government criticized the disclosure as a security breach but stated that the substance of the leak corresponded with other known intelligence and did not contain new information.\nDevelopments with some of the primary objectives of the war—apprehending key al-Qaeda leaders and dealing with the Taliban—were front and centre in 2011. Nearly 10 years after eluding capture at Tora Bora in Afghanistan, bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces on May 2, 2011, after U.S. intelligence located him living in a secure compound in Abbottabad , Pak. The operation, a raid carried out by a small team that reached the compound by helicopter , led to a firefight in which bin Laden died. The next month U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates confirmed for the first time that the U.S. government was holding reconciliation talks with the Taliban, although he stressed that efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict were still in the preliminary stages. Then, on June 22, Obama announced an accelerated timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, saying that the United States had largely achieved its goals by disrupting al-Qaeda’s operations and killing many of its leaders. The plan called for the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to be reduced by as many as 30,000 within a year, in preparation for a complete withdrawal of combat forces by the end of 2014. Hours after Obama’s announcement, French Pres. Nicolas Sarkozy announced that France would also begin to withdraw its 4,000 soldiers from Afghanistan. In September, efforts to end the long-running conflict suffered a setback when Burhanuddin Rabbani , a former Afghan president and a key figure in reconciliation negotiations, was assassinated by a suicide bomber.\nA series of incidents in early 2012 heightened tensions between the U.S. and the Afghan government and provoked public outrage. In mid-January, a video showing U.S. Marines urinating on dead Afghans circulated in the media, drawing apologies from U.S. officials. Weeks later, Afghans rioted and held protests over reports that U.S. soldiers had disposed of copies of the Qurʾān at a military base by burning them. Then, on March 11, a U.S. soldier allegedly left an American base near Panjwai and broke into several homes, shooting dead 17 Afghans, mostly women and children. The incident provoked widespread demonstrations and a sharp condemnation from Karzai. Days later, the Taliban suspended participation in talks with the United States and the Afghan government.\nLater that year NATO ’s efforts to train and equip the Afghan army and police were hampered by an increase in attacks in which Afghan soldiers and police turned their weapons on NATO soldiers. These attacks forced NATO troops to institute more rigorous screening procedures and to suspend the training of certain units.\nMeanwhile, in early 2012, U.S. and Afghan negotiators reached agreements regarding two issues that had been sources of friction between the Obama and Karzai administrations. The first agreement, signed in March, set a six-month timetable for the transfer of Afghan detainees held by the U.S. military to Afghan custody. The second agreement, signed in April, established that Afghan forces would oversee and lead night raids to apprehend or kill Taliban leaders. These raids, previously led by U.S. special forces, had since 2009 become a major component of the campaign against the Taliban. Afghan leaders, however, had long objected that the raids violated Afghan sovereignty and that surprise invasions of private homes ultimately alienated public opinion and increased support for the insurgency.\nThe agreements in March and April concerning detainees and night raids cleared the way for the United States and Afghanistan to reach a further agreement in May outlining a framework for economic and security cooperation between the two countries following the withdrawal of NATO combat troops in 2014. The agreement expressed the United States’ commitment to continuing military support for the Afghan government after 2014, although it left unanswered the question of whether or not some U.S. and NATO forces would remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers after 2014. That was to be determined by a separate pact, the Bilateral Security Agreement . Even though the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan remained deeply unpopular, many Afghans feared that a sudden withdrawal would allow the country to slip into civil war or chaos .\nThe issue of leaving foreign troops in the country after the end of NATO combat operations remained unresolved until the last half of 2014. Karzai—by then in the last months of his presidency—had refused to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement before leaving office, and the election of his successor was delayed by a lengthy recount. In late September 2014 Ashraf Ghani was finally inaugurated as president and immediately signed the Bilateral Security Agreement, which authorized an international force of approximately 13,000 to remain in the country. The U.S. and NATO formally ended their combat mission in Afghanistan on December 28, 2014.",

The one everyone knows is the war in Afghanistan, but the others are the conflicts in the Philippines, Horn of Africa, Pankisi Gorge, Trans Sahara, Caribbean and Central America and Kyrgyzstan.\nOf all these conflicts only those in Kyrgyzstan and Pankisi Gorge have finished, both of which finished in 2004.\nOperation Enduring Freedom Timeline\nOn 11th September 2001 the world stood still as two planes crashed into the world trade center in New York, along with a further plane hitting the Pentagon. Because of the devastating impact on the World Trade Centres’ two towers both of them collapsed and nearly three thousand people perished.\nBy 20th September 2011 it was announced that Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al-Qaeda was responsible for the attack. It was also on the 20th September that the American president at the time, George W. Bush, announced that America and her allies were going to terrorist training camps and building infrastructures as well as capture Al-Qaeda senior leaders.\nOn 7th October 2001 Operation Enduring Freedom started with the conflict in Afghanistan. The initial attacks came in the form of air strikes and missiles launched from both US and UK Navy ships.\nBy January of the next year the US sent 1,200 soldiers into the Philippines to support the Philippine army in eradicating terrorists, a conflict that is still ongoing today.\nBy October 2002 the US set a Naval force along with other coalition countries to Djibouti. This force is called the Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150) and is a massive group of heavily armed ships used for humanitarian missions and also for checked for illegal cargo and training local troops.\nIn February 2002 a force of 200 American Special Forces were sent into Georgia. This force was not for conflict itself but to train Georgian troops so they can protect the Pankisi Gorge from Chechen rebels who used the area as a place of transit.\nOn the 6th February 2007 the Americans and supporting nations from Africa started the military operation to stop drugs and arms trafficking along with counterterrorism efforts in the Sahara region of Africa.\nThe Caribbean and Central America part of Operation Enduring Freedom started in 2008, this involved a group of Special Forces being sent into Belize, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Trinidad & Tobago, Guyana and Suriname to detect terrorist cells.\nIn December 2001 the Americans opened their military installation called Transit Center at Manas in Kyrgyzstan. This base is an important centre for the military operations America carries out in Afghanistan. The base has been pivotal to US operations in Asia and beyond and as such America has agreed to pay higher rent to continue the use of the base.\nRelated Articles",
                "How The War In Afghanistan Began - Business Insider\nprint\nU.S. President George W.   Bush sits after announcing that the U.S. and Britain had started   bombing Afghanistan, in the Treaty Room of the White House in   Washington, October 7, 2001 Reuters   Photographer/REUTERS\nOn October 7, 2001, 13 years ago today, the US launched its   opening attacks against the Taliban in Afghanistan. The   still-ongoing Operation Enduring Freedom, which is now the longest continuous war in American history , had   begun.\nThen-president President George   W. Bush announced the beginning of the US's war in Afghanistan at   1 pm eastern time that day, a Sunday. He  stat ed  that \"on   my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against   al-Qaida terrorist training camps and military installations of   the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.\"\nA day before the start of Operation Enduring Freedom,   then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair assured his public that   any military involvement in Afghanistan would be tightly focused.   The prime minister  ruled   out  attacks against other nations involved in the   planning of terrorism. \nThe first day of the war saw targeted airstrikes carried out by   US and British forces against key pieces of Taliban   infrastructure. Some of the targets bombed included training   camps, defensible positions, and communications equipment.\nFrance, Germany, Australia and Canada  provided  further   logistical support for the conflict's first bombing runs.\nTomahawk cruise missile is launched from the USS   Philippine Sea (CG 58) in a strike against al Qaeda training   camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in   Afghanistan, October 7, 2001. Reuters   Photographer/REUTERS\nNewsweek  reported  on   October 7, 2001 that three US Aegic cruisers and one destroyer in   the Arabian Sea launched over 50 missiles against Taliban   positions in Afghanistan. These attacks were complemented by the   launch of Tomahawk cruise missiles from British and American   submarines. Simultaneously, F/A-18s, B-1s, B-2s, and B-52s   conducted bombing runs over Taliban positions. \nAs airstrikes began against Taliban positions, Bush said that the   US was also undertaking humanitarian aid drops in an attempt to   reassure the local population of America's good intentions. \n\"As we strike military targets, we will also drop food, medicine   and supplies to the starving and suffering men and women and   children of Afghanistan,\" Bush said in his address. \nUS ground forces for what would turn into an over decade-long   fight against the Taliban were not fully in place. The New York   Times  published  on   October 6, 2001 that only a few dozen special forces operatives   were deployed throughout the region in preparation for the coming   assault on the Taliban's centers of power. \nIn addition to these limited number of special   forces,  one   thousand  US soldiers specially trained for mountain   warfare were in place in Uzbekistan at the start of operations.   The early rounds of US on-the-ground fighting on October 7th,   2001 involved US personnel fighting alongside soldiers from the   Northern Alliance, an anti-Taliban group in Northern Afghanistan   pushing south against the extremist regime's front lines. \nA Northern Alliance   soldier shoots a machine gun on the front line near the town of   Alti Hoja in the north of Afghanistan, October 7, 2001. Afghan   opposition forces fighting the ruling Taliban said on Sunday they   had seized 11 villages in the central province of Ghor and were   advancing on the provincial capital   Cheghcharan. Reuters   Photographer/REUTERS\nWith the announcement of the start of Operation Enduring Freedom,   Bush signaled that it would be a long, drawn-out conflict that   would require \"patience in all the sacrifices that may   come.\" \nThe operation continues thirteen years later. When Kabul fell to   coalition forces on November 13th, 2001, few could have expected   that Operation Enduring Freedom — which had fulfilled one of its   prime objectives in a matter of weeks — would become America's   longest war.\nThe majority of US troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan by   December 31, 2014. But an   additional 10,000 US soldiers will remain in Afghanistan as   part of a recently signed bilateral security agreement.\nThis presence of Americans will   provide a much needed psychological boost to the Afghans, as the   Taliban have ratcheted up attacks   recently. Thirteen years later, the war seems far from   definitively won."

                "Stagecoach is a 1939 American Western film directed by John Ford, starring Claire Trevor and John Wayne in his breakthrough role. The screenplay, written by Dudley Nichols, is an adaptation of \"The Stage to Lordsburg\", a 1937 short story by Ernest Haycox. The film follows a group of strangers riding on a stagecoach through dangerous Apache territory.\n\nStagecoach was the first of many Westerns that Ford shot using Monument Valley, in the American south-west on the Arizona–Utah border, as a location, many of which also starred John Wayne. Scenes from Stagecoach, including a famous sequence introducing John Wayne's character the Ringo Kid, blended shots of Monument Valley with shots filmed on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, and other locations.\n\nIn 1995, this film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry.\n\nPlot\n\nIn 1880, a motley group of strangers boards the east-bound stagecoach from Tonto, Arizona Territory to Lordsburg, New Mexico Territory. These travelers are unremarkable and ordinary at first glance.  Among them are Dallas (Claire Trevor), a prostitute who is being driven out of town by the moralistic \"Law and Order League\"; an alcoholic doctor, Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell); pregnant Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt), who is traveling to meet her cavalry officer husband; and whiskey salesman Samuel Peacock (Donald Meek).\n\nWhen the stage driver, Buck (Andy Devine), looks for his normal shotgun guard, Marshal Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft) tells him that the guard is off searching for the fugitive Ringo Kid. Ringo broke out of prison after hearing that his father and brother had been murdered by Luke Plummer (Tom Tyler). Buck tells Curly that Plummer is in Lordsburg. Knowing that Ringo has vowed to avenge his father and brother, Curly decides to ride along as guard.\n\nAs the stage sets out, U.S. Cavalry Lieutenant Blanchard (Tim Holt) announces that Geronimo and his Apaches are on the warpath; his small troop will provide an escort to Dry Fork. At the edge of town, two more passengers flag down the stage and board: gambler and Southern gentleman Hatfield (John Carradine), and banker Henry Gatewood (Berton Churchill), who is absconding with $50,000 embezzled from his bank.\n\nFurther along the road, the stage comes across the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), whose horse went lame and left him afoot. Even though they are friends, Curly has no choice but to take Ringo into custody. As the trip progresses, Ringo takes a strong liking to Dallas. Doc Boone gets drunk on Peacock's samples. When Doc Boone tells Peacock that he served as a doctor in the Union Army during the \"War of the Rebellion,\" Hatfield quickly uses a Southern term, the \"War for the Southern Confederacy.\"\n\nThe stage reaches Dry Fork, but the expected cavalry detachment has gone to Apache Wells. Buck wants to turn back, but Curly demands that the group vote. With only Buck and Peacock objecting, they decide to proceed on to Apache Wells. At lunch before departing, the group is taken aback when Ringo invites Dallas to sit at the main table, and Mrs. Mallory is clearly uncomfortable having lunch with a prostitute. Hatfield gives Mrs. Mallory a drink from his silver pocket flask. She recognizes the family crest on the flask, and asks Hatfield whether he was ever in Virginia. He says he won the flask in a card game, but also that he served in the Confederate Army under her father's command. When the stage reaches Apache Wells, Mrs. Mallory learns that her husband had been wounded in battle and has left; she faints and goes into labor. Doc Boone has to sober up and deliver the baby, and later Dallas emerges holding a healthy baby girl. Later that night, Ringo asks Dallas to marry him, and live on a ranch he owns in Mexico.  Afraid to reveal her checkered past, she does not answer immediately. The next morning, she accepts, if he will give up vengeance on the Plummers. He agrees. But she does not want to leave Mrs. Mallory and the new baby, so she tells him to go alone, and that she will meet him later. Encouraged, Ringo escapes - but then sees smoke signals heralding an Apache attack, and returns. The passengers quickly gather their belongings and leave.\n\nThe stage reaches Lee's Ferry, where Apaches have burned the station and ferry, and killed the station-keeper and his family. Curly uncuffs Ringo to help lash logs to the stagecoach and float it across the river. Just when they think that danger has passed, the Apaches attack. A long chase scene follows, with spectacular stunt work staged by Yakima Canutt. Peacock and Buck are hit, and the party all run out of ammunition. As Hatfield is about to use his last bullet to save Mrs. Mallory from being taken alive, he is mortally wounded. Just then, the 6th U.S. Cavalry rides up to rescue the stage.\n\nThe stage finally arrives in Lordsburg. Gatewood is arrested by the local sheriff, and Mrs. Mallory learns that her husband's wound is not serious. Peacock invites everyone to visit him in Kansas City. Mrs. Mallory thanks Dallas, who gives Mrs. Mallory her shawl, but the other officers' wives snub Dallas. As he dies, Hatfield asks Mrs. Mallory to tell his family that he died bravely. Dallas begs Ringo not to confront the Plummers, but he is determined to settle matters. Curly lets him go (with a gun, but with just three bullets left after the Indian fight).\n\nLuke Plummer, hearing that Ringo is in town, gets up from a poker game, leaving a hand of aces and eights. Plummer takes up a shotgun (an unfair weapon), but Doc Boone blocks his path, demanding that he leave it - or kill Doc first. Plummer leaves the shotgun, to Doc's relief, and joins his two brothers.\n\nA shootout follows, which is heard but not seen. Ringo reappears, having killed the three Plummers, and surrenders to Curly, expecting to go back to prison. He asks Curly to take Dallas to his ranch. Ringo boards a wagon and says goodbye to Dallas, and Curly invites Dallas to ride with them to the edge of town. After she climbs aboard, Curly and Doc laugh and start the horses moving, letting Ringo \"escape\" with Dallas.\n\nCast\n\n* Claire Trevor as Dallas\n* John Wayne as Henry  the \"Ringo Kid\"\n* Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone\n* Andy Devine as Buck\n* John Carradine as Hatfield\n* George Bancroft as Marshal Curly Wilcox\n* Louise Platt as Lucy Mallory\n* Donald Meek as Samuel Peacock\n* Berton Churchill as Henry Gatewood\n* Tim Holt as Lieutenant Blanchard\n* Tom Tyler as Luke Plummer\n* Chris-Pin Martin as Chris, innkeeper\n* Elvira Ríos as Yakima, Chris' wife\n* Brenda Fowler as Mrs. Gatewood\n* Nora Cecil as Boone's housekeeper\n* Francis Ford as Billy Pickett, innkeeper\n* Marga Ann Deighton as Mrs. Pickett\n* Vester Pegg as Ike Plummer\n* Joe Rickson as Hank Plummer\n* Jack Pennick as Jerry, barkeeper in Tonto\n* Duke R.

The rights to \"Lordsburg\" were bought by John Ford soon after it was published in Collier's magazine on 10 April 1937.  According to Thomas Schatz, Ford claimed that his inspiration in expanding Stagecoach beyond the bare-bones plot given in \"The Stage to Lordsburg\" was his familiarity with another short story, \"Boule de Suif\" by Guy de Maupassant.  Schatz believes \"this scarcely holds up to scrutiny\"  and argues that a more likely inspiration was Bret Harte's 1892 short story \"The Outcasts of Poker Flat\".\n\nFord's statement also seems to be the basis for the claim that Haycox himself relied upon Guy de Maupassant's story. However, there appears to be no concrete evidence for Haycox actually being familiar with the earlier story, especially as he was documented as going out of his way to avoid reading the work of others that might unconsciously influence his writing, and he focused his personal reading in the area of history.\n\nAlthough Ford had made many Westerns in the silent film era, he had never previously directed a sound Western. Between 1929 and 1939, he directed films in almost every other genre, including Wee Willie Winkie (1937), starring Shirley Temple. Ford declined to use Wayne in any of his projects during the 1930s despite their close friendship, telling Wayne to wait until he was \"ready\" as an actor. In 1938, Ford gave Wayne a copy of the film's script by Nichols with a request to recommend an actor to play the Ringo Kid. After reading it, Wayne suggested Lloyd Nolan for the part, but Ford was non-committal to the idea. The next day however, Ford announced to Wayne that he wanted him to play the role. The offer left Wayne feeling as if he had been \"hit in the belly with a baseball bat\" ... and fearing that Ford would change his mind and hire Nolan instead.\n\nBefore production, John Ford shopped the project around to several Hollywood studios, all of which turned him down because big budget Westerns were out of vogue, and because Ford insisted on using John Wayne in a key role in the film. Wayne previously appeared in only one big-budget western, The Big Trail (1930, directed by Raoul Walsh), which was a huge box office flop. Between 1930–1939, by Wayne's own estimate, he appeared in about eighty \"Poverty Row\" westerns. Independent producer David O. Selznick finally agreed to produce the film, but was frustrated by Ford's indecision about when shooting would begin, and his own doubts over the casting. Ford withdrew the film from Selznick's company and approached independent producer Walter Wanger about the project. Wanger had the same reservations about producing an \"A\" western and even more about one starring John Wayne. Ford had not directed a western since the silent days, the most notable of which had been The Iron Horse (1924). Wanger said he would not risk his money unless Ford replaced John Wayne with Gary Cooper and brought in Marlene Dietrich to play Dallas. \n\nFord refused to budge; it would be Wayne or no one. Eventually they compromised, with Wanger putting up $250,000, a little more than half of what Ford had been seeking, and Ford would give top billing to Claire Trevor, a more well-known name than John Wayne in 1939.  Following the film's release on March 2, 1939, Ford's faith in John Wayne was rewarded as the film met with immediate critical and trade paper success.  Cast member Louise Platt, in a letter recounting the experience of the film's production, quoted Ford on saying of Wayne's future in film: \"He'll be the biggest star ever because he is the perfect 'everyman'\". \n\nProduction\n\nThe members of the production crew were billeted in Kayenta, in Northeastern Arizona, in an old CCC camp.   Conditions were spartan, production hours long, and weather conditions at this 5700 foot elevation were extreme with constant strong winds and low temperatures.   Nonetheless,  director John Ford was satisfied with the crew's location work.  For this location, filming took place near Goulding's Trading Post on the Utah border, about 25 miles from Kayenta. \n\nReception\n\nStagecoach has been lauded as one of the most influential films ever made. Orson Welles argued that it was a perfect textbook of film-making and claimed to have watched it more than 40 times in preparation for the making of Citizen Kane.  The film made a profit of $297,690.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nAcademy Awards\n\n;Wins\n* Best Supporting Actor - Thomas Mitchell\n* Best Music (Scoring) - Richard Hageman, W. Franke Harling, John Leipold, Leo Shuken\n\n;Nominations\n* Best Picture\n* Best Director - John Ford\n* Best Art Direction - Alexander Toluboff\n* Best Cinematography (Black-and-White) - Bert Glennon\n* Film Editing - Otho Lovering, Dorothy Spencer\n\nOthers\n\n* John Ford won the 1939 New York Film Critics Circle Awards for Best Director. Other critics gave the film uniformly glowing reviews. \n* In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten Top Ten\"—the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Stagecoach was acknowledged as the ninth best film in the western genre.  \n\nRe-releases and restoration\n\nThe film was originally released through United Artists, but under the terms of its seven-year-rights rule, the company surrendered distribution rights to producer Walter Wanger in 1946. Many independent companies were responsible for this film in the years since. The film's copyright (originally by Walter Wanger Productions) was renewed by 20th Century Fox, who produced a later 1966 remake of Stagecoach. The copyright has since been reassigned to Wanger Productions through the late producer's family under the Caidin Trust/Caidin Film Company, the ancillary rights holder. However, distribution rights are now held by Shout! Factory, which in 2014 acquired Jumer Productions/Westchester Films (which in turn had bought the Caidin Film holdings after the folding of former distributor Castle Hill Productions). Warner Bros. Pictures handles sales and additional distribution.\n\nThe original negatives of Stagecoach were either lost or destroyed. John Wayne had one positive print that had never been through a projector gate. In 1970, he permitted it to be used to produce a new negative, and that is the film seen today at film festivals.  UCLA fully restored the film in 1996 from surviving elements and premiered it on cable's American Movie Classics network. The previous DVD releases by Warner Home Video did not contain the restored print, but rather a video print held in the Castle Hill/Caidin Trust library. A digitally restored Blu-ray/DVD version was released in May 2010 via The Criterion Collection.\n\nRemakes\n\n* The May 4, 1946 radio episode of Academy Award Theater had Claire Trevor reprise her role alongside Randolph Scott.\n* The December 7, 1946, radio episode of Hollywood Star Time presented Stagecoach, adapted by Milton Geiger. \n* The January 9, 1949 radio episode of Screen Directors Playhouse had John Wayne and Claire Trevor both reprise their parts.\n* The 1966 remake of Stagecoach starred (in alphabetical order) Ann-Margret, Red Buttons, Mike Connors, Alex Cord, Bing Crosby, Robert Cummings, Van Heflin, Slim Pickens, and Stefanie Powers.\n* A 1986 television version featured Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, and Waylon Jennings."

                "Stagecoach Movie Review & Film Summary (1939) | Roger Ebert\nTweet\n\"Stagecoach\" is a film in which two great careers were renewed. Although he had appeared before in many films, as an extra, a stuntman and then an actor in B films, this was John Wayne 's first starring role in a film by John Ford . For Ford, it was a return after some years to a genre about which his ideas had grown--the genre in which he would make many of his greatest films. With Ford's clout as a director and Wayne's clout as a star, they would make iconic films and establish themselves as one of the legendary partnerships in cinema.\nAdvertisement\nThey came together at a propitious moment in Ford's career. He was 45. He had directed his first silent films (ten of them!) in 1917. He had tasted great success, and won an Academy Award for directing \"The Informer\" in 1936. But now came his years of triumph. No director of the sound era made more great films more quickly than Ford did when he followed \"Stagecoach\" with \"Young Mr. Lincoln\" and \"Drums Along the Mohawk,\" all three in 1939, and then made \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and \"The Long Voyage Home\" in 1940 and \"Tobacco Road\" and \"How Green Was My Valley\" in 1941, collecting in that period three nominations and two Oscars for directing.\nFord had his eye on John Wayne from the days when he was called Marion Morrison, nicknamed Duke, and was a football player from USC, working summers at 20th Century-Fox. In the decade before \"Stagecoach\" Wayne worked in some 40 Westerns, from an extra to a lead, without distinguishing himself. Ford thought he had the makings of a star, and decided Wayne was right for the key role of the Ringo Kid in \"Stagecoach.\" The studio was adamantly opposed to the casting; it demanded a name actor. \"Pappy\" Ford imperiously insisted. And Wayne made an impression that would change his life and one day win him a place on a U. S. postage stamp.\nSeen today, \"Stagecoach\" may not seem very original. That's because it influenced countless later movies in which a mixed bag of characters are thrown together by chance and forced to survive an ordeal. The genre is sometimes called the Ark Movie. The film at times plays like an anthology of timeless clichés. You will see a woman going into labor as a doctor orders, \"Boil water! Hot water! And lots of it!\" You will meet a prostitute with a heart of gold, and an evil banker, and a shifty gambler, and a pure-hearted heroine, and murderous Apaches, and a sultry Indian wife, and a meek little traveling man, and a chase scene with a stagecoach driver going hell for leather. You will see saloons, corrals, vast landscape, camp fires, and the U. S. Cavalry--which sounds the charge before riding to the rescue.\nAdvertisement\nDespite the familiarity of these conventions, \"Stagecoach\" holds our attention effortlessly and is paced with the elegance of a symphony. Ford doesn't squander his action and violence in an attempt to whore for those with short attention spans, but tells astory, during which we learn to know the characters and become invested in them. He doesn't give all the key scenes to the same big star. Top billing went to Claire Trevor, as Dallas, the lady of pleasure. (\"Dallas?\" One is reminded of Marlene Dietrich : \"I didn't become Shanghai Lil in one night.\")\nTrevor was a star, but Ford gave nearly equal weight to the other passengers in the stagecoach, all played by actors who would have been familiar to movie audiences: Squeaky-voiced Andy Devine as the driver, John Carradine as the elegant gambler, Thomas Mitchell as the alcoholic Doc Boone, Louise Platt as the pregnant soldier's wife, and Donald Meek as the effeminate Mr. Peacock, a traveling salesman who improbably wears a checkered deerstalker hat in the Old West. As they line up facing each other, the Ringo Kid sits on the floor between them, but Ford somehow never frames him to seem lower.\nConfined for a good deal of the film inside the stagecoach, these gifted actors create a fascinating community as they gradually reveal their hidden reasons for traveling in great discomfort though hazardous Indian territory. The Ringo Kid, Wayne's character, is a wanted murderer being taken to prison by a U. S. Marshall (George Bancroft). As the others pointedly shun the prostitute Dallas, he insists on her being given a drink of water and a place at the table, and his courtliness is manly and good-hearted. Of course he falls in love with her, and it inspires one of the great scenes:\nAdvertisement\nRingo Kid: \"I still got a ranch across the border. There's a nice place--a real nice place... trees... grass... water. There's a cabin half built. A man could live there... and a woman. Will you go?\"\nDallas: \"But you don't know me--you don't know who I am.\"\nRingo Kid: \"I know all I wanna know.\"\nAdvertisement\nThe way Wayne says that embodies his effortless authority. He says it and you don't doubt he means it. Indeed, the impression he makes here suggests he was perhaps lucky to avoid such a high-visibility role earlier in his career. He was 32 when he made this film, tall and slim, and had outgrown the almost improbable boyish beauty of his youth. He could growl and take a position and hold his ground and not talk too much, and he always sounded like he meant it.\nSimon Callow writes in his biography of Orson Welles that Welles saw \"Stagecoach\" 40 times before he made \" Citizen Kane .\" The two films are hardly similar. What did Welles learn from it? Perhaps most of all a lean editing style. Ford made certain through casting and dialog that the purpose of each scene was made clear, and then he lingered exactly long enough to make the point. Nothing feels superfluous. When he deliberately slows the flow, as for a song performed by Yakima (Elvira Rios), the wife of an outpost boss, we understand it as the calm before a storm. ( Howard Hawks uses a quiet song by Dean Martin in the same way in \" Rio Bravo .\")\nFord never makes the mistake of cutting so quickly that the sense and context of an action sequence is lost. The extended stagecoach chase always makes sense, and he allows his camera to be clear about the stunt work. Consider this extraordinary stunt: An Apache leaps from his own horse onto the stagecoach team, straddling the lead horses. He is shot. He falls between the horses to the ground, and the horses and stagecoach pass entirely over him. No CGI here; he risks his life.\nAdvertisement\nWayne is the hero of the film, but not an \"action hero.\" He was manifestly a bad man; the \"Ringo Kid\" doesn't get his picture on Wanted posters for nothing. But he never suggests evil, and seems prepared to be taken to prison even though he has many opportunities to escape. There is the suggestion he stays with the stagecoach because he is needed to protect its passengers, especially the two women. We see here Wayne's extraordinary physical grace and capacity for tenderness, and understand why Ford later cast him as \"The Quiet Man.\"\nTwo scenes in particular. Wayne in left foreground, leaning against a wall as he watches Dallas walk away from him down a corridor. Observe his body language. The way he looks after her and then straightens up and follows her. And later, look at Ford's lighting and composition as Dallas, in foreground in the moonlight next to a fence, stands alone and the Ringo Kid, in background, the smoke from his cigarillo back-lighted as a backdrop, approaches her.\nThat was a studio shot. But much of the movie is shot on location in Ford's beloved Monument Valley, its prehistoric rock pillars framing the smallness of men. Ford returned again and again to the valley, where his casts and crews lived in tents and were fed from a chuck wagon; he valued the distance from meddling studio executives. He was a dictator, and in that vastness his word was law.\nAdvertisement\nThe film's attitudes toward Native Americans are unenlightened. The Apaches are seen simply as murderous savages; there is no suggestion the white men have invaded their land. Ford shared that simple view with countless other makers of Westerns, and if it was crude in 1939 it was even more so as late as \"The Searchers\" (1956), the greatest Ford/Wayne collaboration. Only in his final film, \"Cheyenne Autumn\" (1964) did he come around to more humane ideas.\nPerhaps because of his long association with Wayne, Ford is often seen as a conservative. In fact he was an outspoken liberal, the standard bearer against Cecil B. DeMille's attempt to force a loyalty oath upon the Directors' Guild during the McCarthy witch-hunt. Ford was not a racist, nor was Wayne, but they made films that were sadly unenlightened. Within \"Stagecoach,\" however, beats a humanitarian heart: None of the occupants of the coach is taken for granted or dismissed casually. They are all given full weight in their mutual dependence. This is a very civilized Western.\nA restored print of \"Stagecoach\" has been released on Blu-ray in the Criterion Collection. Also in my Great Movies series: Ford's \" The Grapes of Wrath \" and \" The Searchers ,\" and Wayne's \"Red River\" and \"Rio Bravo.\"\nAdvertisement",
                "John Ford's Stagecoach (1939) Starring John Wayne and Claire Trevor — Immortal Ephemera\nBy Cliff Aliperti 10 Comments\nStagecoach was the first John Wayne movie I saw when I was a kid and it remains my favorite of any of his films. Revisiting it this week left me amazed by how much Stagecoach manages to grow with you. Filled with a fine supporting cast, each of whose other work has become more familiar to me in the intervening years, it's all the more impressive that no matter what age I watch Stagecoach John Wayne's Ringo Kid still towers above them all.\nIt's still my favorite screen entrance. We've heard a bit about him, but we don't meet the Ringo Kid until over 18 minutes into the movie. It looks the same every time, no surprises anymore, but it still gets a rise out of me. The camera catches Ringo from afar, makes a shaky approach that confuses to a blur before sharpening close upon his facial features. No matter how many times you've seen it that brief blur delivers a beat of anticipation knowing that once he comes into focus he's going to remain the focus. Credit John Ford for the style; credit John Wayne for sheer presence. It is one of those screen moments I wish I could go back and enjoy for the first time all over again.\nRingo stands defiant yet quickly reveals himself to be down to earth, polite, even conscientious. All around charming. Character is the character's strength, all the more so when you remember that Ringo is an escaped convict on a mission of vengeance. Ringo's brother and father were killed by badman Luke Plummer and his brothers. Now Ringo wants Plummer. George Bancroft's Curley immediately puts Ringo under arrest, but from the second Ringo joins the others you know they're going to need him. You also know that there's nothing that could possibly restrain him from evening the score with the Plummer boys.\nNothing but Claire Trevor's Dallas, a prostitute riding the stage to Lordsburg after being driven from town by the women of high society. How Trevor couldn't get an Oscar nomination in 1940 can only be explained with a shrug of the shoulders and quiet mention of 1939, commonly held up as the movies' greatest year. Stiff competition.\nWhat I forgot about Stagecoach until watching again this week, perhaps being too involved with Ringo to have ever even noticed before, is Trevor's stunning performance. The woman is broken and her fractured state causes her to really take society's scolding to heart. Her past keeps her from looking others in the eye when she speaks. She's used to scorn. So when Ringo treats her like a lady, just as much a lady as the respectable Mrs. Mallory (Louise Platt), Trevor's Dallas is so overwhelmed that her replies come in a quiver. Her shaky voice almost breaks you. You long to comfort her. Thankfully Ringo is there. Her eyes light up at his innocent defense of her. Ringo calls her \"ma'am\" and \"Miss Dallas\" while the others, excepting Doc (Thomas Mitchell), do their best not to speak to her at all.\nWhat I hadn't remembered about Stagecoach was that besides the incredible collection of characters, the breathtaking shots of Monument Valley, and beyond the rousing shoot 'em up action is, thanks to Trevor, a touching love story that stands out above all those other masterful ingredients.\nStagecoach was based on the Ernest Haycox short story \"Stage to Lordsburg,\" which was brief enough to appear in its entirety inside just one edition of Collier's Magazine. That April 10, 1937 edition of Collier's is a heck of a find for classic movie fans as not only does it include the basis of Stagecoach but Hagar Wilde's short story \"Bringing Up Baby\" as well!\nStage to Lordsburg by Ernest Haycox as it appeared inside the April 10, 1937 edition of Collier's Magazine.\nJohn Ford spent $2,500 for the rights to Haycox's story and then unsuccessfully shopped it around until Walter Wanger wisely bit. Wanger wanted Gary Cooper and Marlene Dietrich to play Ringo and Dallas, but Ford wisely preferred to spread his budget over more talent to fill out the cast. Thankfully so as it is now hard to imagine anyone but these recognizable faces in each of Stagecoach's roles.\nFor as great as John Wayne and Claire Trevor are we also have Thomas Mitchell , who did win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in his part of the drunken Doc; The menacing John Carradine, dressed in black with a past to match as Hatfield; Andy Devine doing his usual delightful croaking as stagecoach driver, Buck; experienced and somewhat haggard looking George Bancroft as the Marshall, Curley, riding shotgun alongside Buck; Louise Platt looking as fragile as porcelain as the beautiful Lucy Mallory in search of her cavalry husband; the so properly named Donald Meek as Peacock, the quiet whiskey salesman who everyone confuses for a clergyman; and Berton Churchill as the shifty banker Gatewood who's playing just the part that pre-code fans would expect of him.\nLeaving the love story behind Stagecoach is still a gripping action film with layers of suspense that are continuously fulfilled.\nFrom the start, well before we even meet Ringo, there's the threat of Geronimo and the Apache. It saddles the Cavalry, led by young Tim Holt, alongside Buck's stage for the first part of the journey and is the prime threat to all throughout Stagecoach.\nOnce Ringo joins the others the looming threat of his own one-on-one showdown begins to take over as prime concern of the audience. Why? Because we care so much about Ringo and it has been established that Luke Plummer (Tom Tyler) is a better shot than he is. And even if he isn't he has two brothers to more than shift the odds in his favor.\nAs we become more involved with the Ringo Kid and Dallas we become more concerned about the threat of the Plummers. Of course, just as the Plummers loom as the sole threat in our minds the Apache send out war signals and we're sucked back into the lives of all our other interesting friends.\nJohn Ford's Stagecoach premiered in Los Angeles, February 15, 1939 before going into general release that March. It was an immediate critical and popular success and continues to be so.\nWhile a legendary collection of leading ladies may have kept Claire Trevor from an Oscar nomination in 1940, Stagecoach fared pretty well as a whole receiving seven Academy Award nominations in total, including Best Picture and Best Director, and winning two, Mitchell's for Supporting Actor and another split four ways for its score.\nI don't usually cover the really big movies like Stagecoach. It seems like everyone has seen it and everything has been written about it. But I do know there are people with a bias against Westerns. I know it personally through various friends and family. Stagecoach is delivered as a Western, sure, but forget about genre here. Anyone who loves rich characters and a poignant love story, and can withstand a bit of action along the way, will find something to love about Stagecoach.\nShare this:"

                "Eric Donaldson (born 11 June 1947 in St. Catherine, Jamaica) is a Jamaican reggae singer-songwriter.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Bog Walk, about 2 miles from Kent Village], Donaldson first recorded for Studio One in 1964, although producer Clement Dodd declined to release the material.   In the mid-1960s he formed The West Indians with Leslie Burke and Hector Brooks, and they had a hit with the J.J. Johnson-produced \"Right On Time\" in 1968, going on to record with Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and subsequently changing their name to the Kilowatts, but without further success.\n\nDonaldson then pursued a solo career, and submitted \"Cherry Oh Baby\" to the 1971 Jamaican Festival Song Competition, going on to win the competition and giving him a big Jamaican hit single. Donaldson has won the competition six times, in 1971, 1977, 1978, 1984, 1993 and 1997.  \"Cherry Oh Baby\" has been covered by both The Rolling Stones (on their 1976 album, Black and Blue) and UB40 (on their 1983 album, Labour of Love).

                "Red Red Wine by UB40 Songfacts\nRed Red Wine by UB40 Songfacts\nSongfacts\nThis was written and first recorded by Neil Diamond. His original version first appeared on his 1967 album Just For You (Bang 217) and was produced by Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich (a.k.a. The Raindrops of \"The Kind Of Boy You Can't Forget\" fame). Neil's version of the song (Bang single 556) peaked at #62 over a three-week run in April 1968.\nIn the UK, two versions of the song charted in 1969: a soul cover by Jimmy James & The Vagabonds hit #36 (it also made #127 in the US), and a Reggae rendition by Tony Tribe hit #46. UB40, whose members grew up listening to these versions, took it to #1 UK with their 1983 cover.\nThe lyrics sing the praises of wine, and its ability to make you forget your problems. Diamond wrote another song about red wine in 1970 with Cracklin' Rosie .\nUB40 recorded this as a cover of the Tony Tribe 1969 reggae version, which reached #46 in the UK charts. The band did not realize until after it topped the charts that Neil Diamond wrote it and originally recorded it. Lead singer Ali Campbell recalls in the book 1000 UK #1 Hits: \"The funny thing about the song is we only knew it as a Reggae song. We had no idea that Neil Diamond wrote it.\" Terence \"Astro\" Wilson, confirmed: \"Even when we saw the writing credit which said N. Diamond, we thought it was a Jamaican artist called Negus Diamond or something.\"\nThis was re-issued in the States after DJ Guy Zapoleon at KZZP-FM in Phoenix, Arizona included the song on his \"Would've Been, Should've Been\" feature. There was such a positive response that he urged the record company to re-issue the single. Within a few weeks the song had climbed to the top of the charts.\nUB40's original recording reached #34 in the US in March 1984 when it was released on A&M 2600. This version clocked in at 3:00. In 1988, it was reissued as a longer version (5:16) with a rap by Terence \"Astro\" Wilson, and finally hit #1.\nThe 1969 Tony Tribe version caught on in England with a hooligan crowd known as \"bovver boys.\" These guys typically sported shaved heads, heavy boots, and cropped pants held up by suspenders (or as they're called in England, \"braces\").\nTribe performed the song in September 1969 at a reggae festival held in London at Empire Pool; other acts on the bill included Desmond Dekker, Johnny Nash and Max Romeo. To show his support for the bovver boys who bought his record, Tribe wore suspenders for his performance. His cover of the song would later find its way onto various \"skinhead reggae\" playlists.\nThe album Labour Of Love is a collection of covers comprised of reggae songs the band grew up listening to; other tracks include \"Many Rivers To Cross\" by Jimmy Cliff and \"Cherry Oh Baby\" by Eric Donaldson. It was UB40's fourth album, and the group was eager to expose their expanding fanbase to the reggae classics they loved. \"Before we come along, people just looked on reggae as Rastaman, and half the white English people don't want to know,\" the group's rapper Astro Wilson told NME. \"To some degree that alienated people from getting into reggae. When we came out - just the fact that half the band are white when reggae was supposed to be for Rastas only - they started to realize that reggae is just music and it's there for whoever wants to listen to it, and whoever wants to play it.\"\nThis song didn't take off America when it was first released in 1983, but another reggae tune did: \" Electric Avenue \" by Eddy Grant, which hit #2. UB40 bass player Earl Falconer recalls being mistaken for Grant when the band toured in America around this time.\nIn the music video, lead singer Ali Campbell is actually drinking beer, and not red wine. The video was filmed in a local Birmingham, England pub where you wouldn't want to be caught drinking wine.\nTo avoid hiring extras, the band invited guys from a nearby factory to join them at the pub, graciously paying the bar bill in exchange for their services. It was shot in the morning, and by noon, most of these hired hands were blotto. According to various accounts, when they staggered back to work, they were fired on the spot, although later given their jobs back.\nThe black-and-white clip was directed by Bernard Rose, who worked on many of UB40's videos and also directed the original, bacchanalian \" Relax \" clip for Frankie Goes To Hollywood.\nIn America, a slower, string-laden version of the song made #70 Vic Dana (Liberty 56163) in 1970.\nUB40's next #1 UK hit came in 1985 with another reggae-tinged cover of a song by an American artist: \" I Got You Babe .\" They recorded the song with Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders, who brought them on tour early in their career. This cover also made #28 in America.",

The title track of this album, \"Cherry oh baby\", was successfully  covered by UB 40 giving them an international hit in 1984. The track was  also previously covered by the Rolling Stones on their \"Black and Blue\"  album in 1976. UB 40 were also inspired to record \"The Way you do the  Things you do\" by Eric Donaldson's reggae arrangement and included on  this CD of the original Temptations song.\nVarious - Reggae That Inspired UB40\nAs probably the best known reggae band after Bob Marley & The   Wailers, UB40 have never made any secret of the the fact that not only   were they inspired by reggae, but they also had many hits by covering   tracks originally recorded by Jamaican reggae artists. It was the reggae recording of \"Red, Red Wine\" by Tony Tribe (although  an original Neil Diamond hit in the 60's) that led to UB40 covering it  themselves. Other major hits were scored with versions of \"Cherry Oh  Baby\", \"Many Rivers to Cross\", \"Kingston Town\", \"Impossible Love\" and  \"Here I am\", of which all the original reggae recordings are featured on  this album. In fact all the songs included on this CD are the original  reggae recordings of songs later recorded by UB40, mostly on their  \"Labour of Love \" projects.",

                "The Horn of Africa (, ,  yäafrika qänd,  al-qarn al-'afrīqī, ) (shortened to HOA) is a peninsula in Northeast Africa. It juts hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. The area is the easternmost projection of the African continent. Referred to in ancient and medieval times as Bilad al Barbar (\"Land of the Berbers\"),    the Horn of Africa denotes the region containing the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia.    \n\nIt covers approximately 2,000,000 km2 (770,000 sq mi) and is inhabited by roughly 115 million people (Ethiopia: 96.6 million, Somalia: 10.4 million, Eritrea: 6.4 million, and Djibouti: 0.81 million). Regional studies on the Horn of Africa are carried out, among others, in the fields of Ethiopian Studies as well as Somali Studies.\n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory\n\nShell middens 125,000 years old have been found in Eritrea,  indicating the diet of early humans included seafood obtained by beachcombing.\n\nAccording to both genetic and fossil evidence, archaic Homo sapiens evolved to anatomically modern humans solely in Africa between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. Evidence to support the theory that recent modern humans originated in East Africa is not conclusive. \n\nToday at the Bab-el-Mandeb straits, the Red Sea is about 12 miles (20 kilometres) wide, but 50,000 years ago it was much narrower and sea levels were 70 meters lower. Though the straits were never completely closed, there may have been islands in between which could be reached using simple rafts.\n\nIt has been estimated that from a population of 2,000 to 5,000 individuals in Africa,  only a small group of possibly as few as 150 to 1,000 people crossed the Red Sea. \n\nAccording to linguists, the first Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing Neolithic era from the family's proposed urheimat (\"original homeland\") in the Nile Valley,  or the Near East.  Other scholars propose that the Afro-Asiatic family developed in situ in the Horn, with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there.  Genetic analysis also indicates that, beginning in the pre-agricultural period, settlers from the Near East founded communities in Northeast Africa. These early settlements eventually gave rise to the Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn and Maghreb as the groups spread. \n\nAncient history\n\nTogether with northern Somalia, Djibouti, the Red Sea coast of Sudan and Eritrea is considered the most likely location of the land known to the ancient Egyptians as Punt (or \"Ta Netjeru,\" meaning god's land), whose first mention dates to the 25th century BCE.  The ancient Puntites were a nation of people that had close relations with Pharaonic Egypt during the times of Pharaoh Sahure and Queen Hatshepsut.\n\nDʿmt was a kingdom located in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia that existed during the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. With its capital at Yeha, the kingdom developed irrigation schemes, used plows, grew millet, and made iron tools and weapons. After the fall of Dʿmt in the 5th century BCE, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms, until the rise of one of these kingdoms during the 1st century, the Aksumite Kingdom, which was able to reunite the area. \n\nThe Kingdom of Aksum (also known as the Aksumite Empire) was an ancient state located in the highlands of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea that thrived between the 1st and 7th centuries CE. A major player in the commerce between the Roman Empire and Ancient India, Aksum's rulers facilitated trade by minting their own currency. The state also established its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of Kush and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian peninsula, eventually extending its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom. Under Ezana (fl. 320-360), Aksum became the first major empire to convert to Christianity, and was named by Mani as one of the four great powers of his time, along with Persia, Rome and China.\n\nNorthern Somalia was an important link in the Horn, connecting the region's commerce with the rest of the ancient world. Somali sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of frankincense, myrrh and spices, all of which were valuable luxuries to the Ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Mycenaeans, Babylonians and Romans.   The Romans consequently began to refer to the region as Regio Aromatica. In the classical era, several flourishing Somali city-states such as Opone, Mosylon and Malao also competed with the Sabaeans, Parthians and Axumites for the rich Indo-Greco-Roman trade. \n\nThe birth of Islam opposite the Horn's Red Sea coast meant that local merchants and sailors living on the Arabian Peninsula gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted Arab Muslim trading partners. With the migration of Muslim families from the Islamic world to the Horn in the early centuries of Islam, and the peaceful conversion of the local population by Muslim scholars in the following centuries, the ancient city-states eventually transformed into Islamic Mogadishu, Berbera, Zeila, Barawa and Merka, which were part of the Berber civilization.   The city of Mogadishu came to be known as the \"City of Islam\"  and controlled the East African gold trade for several centuries. \n\nMiddle Ages and Early Modern era\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, several powerful empires dominated the regional trade, including the Adal Sultanate, the Ajuran Sultanate, the Warsangali Sultanate, the Zagwe dynasty and the Sultanate of the Geledi.\n\nThe Adal Sultanate was a medieval multi-ethnic Muslim state in the Horn. At its height, it controlled large parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Eritrea. Many of the historic cities in the region, such as Amud, Maduna, Abasa, Berbera, Zeila and Harar, flourished during the kingdom's golden age, a period that left behind numerous courtyard houses, mosques, shrines and walled enclosures. After the death of Sa'ad ad-Din II, Adal succeeded the Sultanate of Ifat as the pre-eminent local Muslim power. Under the leadership of rulers such as Sabr ad-Din II, Mansur ad-Din, Jamal ad-Din II, Shams ad-Din, General Mahfuz and Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, Adalite armies continued the struggle against the Solomonic dynasty, a campaign historically known as the Conquest of Abyssinia or Futuh al Habash.\n\nThe Warsangali Sultanate was a kingdom centered in northeastern and in some parts of southeastern Somalia. It was one of the largest sultanates ever established in the territory, and, at the height of its power, included the Sanaag region and parts of the northeastern Bari region of the country, an area historically known as Maakhir or the Maakhir Coast. The Sultanate was founded in the late 13th century in northern Somalia by a group of Somalis from the Warsangali branch of the Darod clan, and was ruled by the descendants of the Gerad Dhidhin.\n\nThrough a strong centralized administration and an aggressive military stance towards invaders, the Ajuran Sultanate successfully resisted an Oromo invasion from the west and a Portuguese incursion from the east during the Gaal Madow and the Ajuran-Portuguese wars. Trading routes dating from the ancient and early medieval periods of Somali maritime enterprise were also strengthened or re-established, and the state left behind an extensive architectural legacy. Many of the hundreds of ruined castles and fortresses that dot the landscape of Somalia today are attributed to Ajuran engineers,  including a lot of the pillar tomb fields, necropolises and ruined cities built during that era. The royal family, the House of Gareen, also expanded its territories and established its hegemonic rule through a skillful combination of warfare, trade linkages and alliances. \n\nThe Zagwe dynasty ruled many parts of modern Ethiopia and Eritrea from approximately 1137 to 1270. The name of the dynasty comes from the Cushitic-speaking Agaw people of northern Ethiopia. From 1270 onwards for many centuries, the Solomonic dynasty ruled the Ethiopian Empire.\n\nIn the early 15th century, Ethiopia sought to make diplomatic contact with European kingdoms for the first time since Aksumite times. A letter from King Henry IV of England to the Emperor of Abyssinia survives.  In 1428, the Emperor Yeshaq sent two emissaries to Alfonso V of Aragon, who sent return emissaries who failed to complete the return trip. \n\nThe first continuous relations with a European country began in 1508 with Portugal under Emperor Lebna Dengel, who had just inherited the throne from his father.  This proved to be an important development, for when Abyssinia was subjected to the attacks of the Adal Sultanate General and Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (called \"Gurey\" or \"Grañ\", both meaning \"the Left-handed\"), Portugal assisted the Ethiopian emperor by sending weapons and four hundred men, who helped his son Gelawdewos defeat Ahmad and re-establish his rule.  This Abyssinian–Adal War was also one of the first proxy wars in the region as the Ottoman Empire, and Portugal took sides in the conflict.\n\nWhen Emperor Susenyos converted to Roman Catholicism in 1624, years of revolt and civil unrest followed resulting in thousands of deaths.  The Jesuit missionaries had offended the Orthodox faith of the local Ethiopians. On June 25, 1632, Susenyos's son, Emperor Fasilides, declared the state religion to again be Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and expelled the Jesuit missionaries and other Europeans.  \n\nThe Sultanate of the Geledi was a Somali kingdom administered by the Gobroon dynasty, which ruled parts of the Horn of Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was established by the Ajuran soldier Ibrahim Adeer, who had defeated various vassals of the Ajuran Empire and established the House of Gobroon. The dynasty reached its apex under the successive reigns of Sultan Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim, who successfully consolidated Gobroon power during the Bardera wars, and Sultan Ahmed Yusuf, who forced regional powers such as the Omani Empire to submit tribute.\n\nThe Majeerteen Sultanate (Migiurtinia) was another prominent Somali sultanate based in the Horn region. Ruled by King Osman Mahamuud during its golden age, it controlled much of northeastern and central Somalia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. It also entered into treaties with foreign powers and exerted strong centralized authority on the domestic front.   Much of the Sultanate's former domain is today coextensive with the autonomous Puntland region in northeastern Somalia. \n\nThe Sultanate of Hobyo was a 19th-century Somali kingdom founded by Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid. Initially, Kenadid's goal was to seize control of the neighboring Majeerteen Sultanate, which was then ruled by his cousin Boqor Osman Mahamuud. However, he was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and was eventually forced into exile in Yemen. A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the Arabian Peninsula with a band of Hadhrami musketeers and a group of devoted lieutenants. With their assistance, he managed to establish the kingdom of Hobyo, which would rule much of northeastern and central Somalia during the early modern period. \n\nModern history\n\nIn the period following the opening of the Suez canal in 1869, when European powers scrambled for territory in Africa and tried to establish coaling stations for their ships, Italy invaded and occupied Eritrea. On January 1, 1890, Eritrea officially became a colony of Italy. In 1896 further Italian incursion into the horn was decisively halted by Ethiopian forces. By 1936 however, Eritrea became a province of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana), along with Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland. By 1941, Eritrea had about 760,000 inhabitants, including 70,000 Italians.  The Commonwealth armed forces, along with the Ethiopian patriotic resistance, expelled those of Italy in 1941,  and took over the area's administration. The British continued to administer the territory under a UN Mandate until 1951, when Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia, as per UN resolution 390(A) and under the prompting of the United States adopted in December 1950.\n\nThe strategic importance of Eritrea, due to its Red Sea coastline and mineral resources, was the main cause for the federation with Ethiopia, which in turn led to Eritrea's annexation as Ethiopia's 14th province in 1952. This was the culmination of a gradual process of takeover by the Ethiopian authorities, a process which included a 1959 edict establishing the compulsory teaching of Amharic, the main language of Ethiopia, in all Eritrean schools. The lack of regard for the Eritrean population led to the formation of an independence movement in the early 1960s (1961), which erupted into a 30-year war against successive Ethiopian governments that ended in 1991. Following a UN-supervised referendum in Eritrea (dubbed UNOVER) in which the Eritrean people overwhelmingly voted for independence, Eritrea declared its independence and gained international recognition in 1993.  In 1998, a border dispute with Ethiopia led to the Eritrean-Ethiopian War. \n\nFrom 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the Gulf of Tadjoura situated in modern-day Djibouti was called Obock and was ruled by Somali and Afar Sultans, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region.    In 1894, Léonce Lagarde established a permanent French administration in the city of Djibouti and named the region Côte française des Somalis (French Somaliland), a name which continued until 1967.\n\nIn 1958, on the eve of neighboring Somalia's independence in 1960, a referendum was held in the territory to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans.Barrington, Lowell, After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States, (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115 There was also reports of widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.  The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later. Djibouti finally gained its independence from France in 1977, and Hassan Gouled Aptidon, a Somali politician who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, eventually wound up as the nation's first president (1977–1999). In early 2011, the Djiboutian citizenry took part in a series of protests against the long-serving government, which were associated with the larger Arab Spring demonstrations. The unrest eventually subsided by April of the year, and Djibouti's ruling People's Rally for Progress party was re-elected to office.\n\nMohammed Abdullah Hassan's Dervish State successfully repulsed the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.  Due to these successful expeditions, the Dervish State was recognized as an ally by the Ottoman and German Empires. The Turks also named Hassan Emir of the Somali nation,  and the Germans promised to officially recognize any territories the Dervishes were to acquire.  After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 as a direct consequence of Britain's new policy of aerial bombardment.  As a result of this bombardment, former Dervish territories were turned into a protectorate of Britain. Italy faced similar opposition from Somali Sultans and armies, and did not acquire full control of parts of modern Somalia until the Fascist era in late 1927. This occupation lasted until 1941, and was replaced by a British military administration. Northern Somalia would remain a protectorate, while southern Somalia became a trusteeship. The Union of the two regions in 1960 formed the Somali Republic. A civilian government was formed, and on July 20, 1961, through a popular referendum, a new constitution that had first been drafted the year before was ratified. \n\nDue to its longstanding ties with the Arab world, Somalia was accepted in 1974 as a member of the Arab League.  During the same year, the nation's former socialist administration also chaired the Organization of African Unity, the predecessor of the African Union.  In 1991, the Somali Civil War broke out, which saw the collapse of the federal government and the emergence of numerous autonomous polities, including the Puntland administration in the northeast and Somaliland, an unrecognised self-declared sovereign state that is internationally recognised as an autonomous region of Somalia,  in the northwest. Somalia's inhabitants subsequently reverted to local forms of conflict resolution, either secular, Islamic or customary law, with a provision for appeal of all sentences. A Transitional Federal Government was subsequently created in 2004. The Federal Government of Somalia was established on August 20, 2012, concurrent with the end of the TFG's interim mandate.  It represents the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war. The Federal Parliament of Somalia serves as the government's legislative branch. \n\nModern Ethiopia and its current borders are a result of significant territorial reduction in the north and expansion in the east and south toward its present borders, owing to several migrations, commercial integration, treaties as well as conquests, particularly by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena.  From the central province of Shoa, Menelik set off to subjugate and incorporate ‘the lands and people of the South, East and West into an empire.’  He did this with the help of Ras Gobena's Shewan Oromo militia, began expanding his kingdom to the south and east, expanding into areas that had not been held since the invasion of Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, and other areas that had never been under his rule, resulting in the borders of Ethiopia of today.  Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889, in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia’s sovereignty so long as Italy could control a small area of northern Tigray (part of modern Eritrea).  In return Italy, was to provide Menelik with arms and support him as emperor.  The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to further expand their territorial claims. Italy began a state funded program of resettlement for landless Italians in Eritrea, which increased tensions between the Eritrean peasants and the Italians. This conflict erupted in the Battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896, in which Italy’s colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians. \n\nThe early 20th century in Ethiopia was marked by the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie I, who came to power after Iyasu V was deposed. In 1935, Haile Selassie's troops fought and lost the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, after which point Italy annexed Ethiopia to Italian East Africa.  Haile Selassie subsequently appealed to the League of Nations, delivering an address that made him a worldwide figure and 1935's Time magazine Man of the Year.  Following the entry of Italy into World War II, British Empire forces, together with patriot Ethiopian fighters, liberated Ethiopia in the course of the East African Campaign in 1941.  Haile Selassie's reign came to an end in 1974, when a Soviet-backed Marxist-Leninist military junta, the Derg led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, deposed him, and established a one-party communist state, which was called the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. In July 1977, the Ogaden War broke out after the government of President of Somalia Siad Barre sought to incorporate the predominantly Somali-inhabited Ogaden region into a Pan-Somali Greater Somalia. By September 1977, the Somali army controlled 90% of the Ogaden, but was later forced to withdraw after Ethiopia's Derg received assistance from the USSR, Cuba, South Yemen, East Germany  and North Korea, including around 15,000 Cuban combat troops. In 1989, the Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements to form the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), and eventually managed to overthrow Mengistu's dictatorial regime in 1991. A transitional government, composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution, was then set up. The first free and democratic election took place later in 1995, when Ethiopia's longest-serving Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was elected to office. As with other nations in the Horn region, Ethiopia maintained its historically close relations with countries in the Middle East during this period of change.  Zenawi died in 2012, but his Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) party remains the ruling political coalition in Ethiopia.\n\nGeography\n\nGeology and climate\n\nThe Horn of Africa is almost equidistant from the equator and the Tropic of Cancer. It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a fissure in the Earth's crust extending from Turkey to Mozambique and marking the separation of the African and Arabian tectonic plates. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.\n\nGeologically, the Horn and Yemen once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the Gulf of Aden rifted and separated the Horn region from the Arabian Peninsula.   The Somali Plate is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the triple junction in the Afar Depression, and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the Aden Ridge along the coast of Saudi Arabia. The eastern boundary is the Central Indian Ridge, the northern portion of which is also known as the Carlsberg Ridge. The southern boundary is the Southwest Indian Ridge.\n\nExtensive glaciers once covered the Simien and Bale Mountains but melted at the beginning of the Holocene. The mountains descend in a huge escarpment to the Red Sea and more steadily to the Indian Ocean. Socotra is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is 3,600 km2 (1,390 sq mi) and it is a territory of Yemen.\n\nThe lowlands of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical monsoons that give seasonal rains to the Sahel and the Sudan blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\nIn the mountains of Ethiopia, many areas receive over 2,000 mm (80 in) per year, and even Asmara receives an average of 570 mm (23 in). This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including Egypt. In the winter, the northeasterly trade winds do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as 500 mm (20 in). On the eastern coast, a strong upwelling and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as 50 mm (2 in).\n\nThe climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At Addis Ababa, which ranges from  2200 to, maximum temperature is 26 C and minimum 4 C. The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (belg) rains occur from February to April and the big (meher) rains from mid-June to mid-September. The Danakil Desert stretches across 100,000 km2 of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45 °C and often surpassing 50 °C. It has a number lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the Danakil Depression. The Afrera contains many active volcanoes, including the Maraho, Dabbahu, Afdera and Erta Ale.  \n\nIn Somalia, there is not much seasonal variation in its climate. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from 28 to, except at higher elevations along the eastern seaboard, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. Somalia has only two permanent rivers, the Jubba and the Shabele, both of which begin in the Ethiopian Highlands. \n\nEcology\n\nAbout 220 mammals are found in the Horn of Africa. Among threatened species of the region, there are several antelopes such as the beira, the dibatag, the silver dikdik and the Speke's gazelle. Other remarkable species include the Somali wild ass, the desert warthog, the hamadryas baboon, the Somali pygmy gerbil, the ammodile, and the Speke's pectinator. The Grevy's zebra is the unique wild equid of the region. There are predators such as spotted hyena, striped hyena and African leopard. The endangered painted hunting dog had populations in the Horn of Africa, but pressures from human exploitation of habitat along with warfare have reduced or extirpated this canid in this region. \n\nSome important bird species of the Horn are the Bulo Burti boubou, the golden-winged grosbeak, the Warsangli linnet, and the Djibouti francolin.\n\nThe Horn of Africa holds more endemic reptiles than any other region in Africa, with over 285 species total (and about 90 species found exclusively in the region). Among endemic reptile genera, there are Haackgreerius, Haemodracon, Ditypophis, Pachycalamus and Aeluroglena. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, amphibians are poorly represented in the region.\n\nThere are about 100 species of freshwater fish in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic. Among the endemic, the cave-dwelling Somali blind barb and the Somali cavefish can be found.\n\nIt is estimated that about 5,000 species of vascular plants are found in the Horn, about half of which are endemic. Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant families: the Barbeyaceae and the Dirachmaceae. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra (Dendrosicyos socotrana), the Bankoualé palm, the yeheb nut, and the Somali cyclamen.\n\nDue to the Horn of Africa's semi-arid and arid climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's pastoral groups have observed careful rangeland management practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983–85, 1991–92, 1998–99 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population. Initiatives by ECHO and USAID have succeeded in reclaiming hundreds of hectares of pastureland through rangeland management, leading to the establishment of the Dikale Rangeland in 2004. \n\nEthnicity and languages\n\nBesides sharing similar geographic endowments, the countries of the Horn of Africa are, for the most part, linguistically and ethnically linked together, evincing a complex pattern of interrelationships among the various groups. \n\nAccording to Ethnologue, there are 10 individual languages spoken in Djibouti, 14 in Eritrea, 90 in Ethiopia, and 15 in Somalia.  Most people in the Horn speak Afro-Asiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches. The former includes Oromo, spoken by the Oromo people in Ethiopia, and Somali, spoken by the Somali people in Somalia, Djibouti and Ethiopia; the latter includes Amharic, spoken by the Amhara people of Ethiopia, and Tigrinya, spoken by the Tigray-Tigrinya people of Eritrea and Ethiopia. Other Afro-Asiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Afar, Saho, Hadiyya, Sidamo and Agaw languages, as well as the Semitic Tigre, Gurage, Harari, Silt'e and Argobba tongues. \n\nAdditionally, Omotic languages are spoken by Omotic communities inhabiting Ethiopia's southern regions. Among these idioms are Aari, Dizi, Gamo, Kafa, Hamer and Wolaytta. \n\nLanguages belonging to the Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo families are also spoken in some areas by Nilotic and Bantu ethnic minorities, respectively. These tongues include the Nilo-Saharan Me'en and Mursi languages used in southwestern Ethiopia, and Kunama and Nara idioms spoken in parts of southern Eritrea. In the riverine and littoral areas of southern Somalia, Bajuni, Barawani, and Bantu groups also speak variants of the Niger-Congo Swahili and Mushunguli languages.  \n\nCulture\n\nThe countries of the Horn of Africa have been the birthplace of many ancient, as well as modern, cultural achievements in several fields including agriculture, architecture, art, cuisine, education, literature, music, technology and theology to name but a few.\n\nEthiopian agriculture established the earliest known use of the seed grass Teff (Poa abyssinica) between 4000-1000 BCE.  Teff is used to make the flat bread injera/taita. Coffee also originated in Ethiopia and has since spread to become a worldwide beverage.  Ethiopian art is renowned for the ancient tradition of Ethiopian Orthodox Christian iconography stretching back to wall paintings of the 7th century CE.  Somali architecture includes the Fakr ad-Din Mosque, which was built in 1269 by the Fakr ad-Din, the first Sultan of the Sultanate of Mogadishu.  Ethiopia, too is renowned for its ancient churches, such as at the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Lalibela. \n\nThe Horn has produced numerous indigenous writing systems, most notably the script known as Ge'ez ( '), (also controversially called Ethiopic) for 2000 years.  It is an abugida script that was originally developed to write the Ge'ez language. In speech communities that use it, such as the Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called ' (), which means \"script\" or \"alphabet\".\n\nIn the early 20th century, in response to a national campaign to settle on a writing script for the Somali language (which had long since lost its ancient script ), Osman Yusuf Kenadid, a Somali poet and leader in the Majeerteen Sultanate of Hobyo and nephew of Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid, also devised a phonetically sophisticated alphabet called Osmanya (also known as far soomaali; Osmanya: 𐒍𐒖𐒇 𐒈𐒝𐒑𐒛𐒐𐒘), for representing the sounds of Somali. Though no longer the official writing script in Somalia, the Osmanya script is available in the Unicode range 10480-104AF [from U+10480 - U+104AF (66688–66735)].\n\nThe Somali writer Nuruddin Farah has also garnered acclaim as perhaps the most celebrated writer ever to come out of the Horn of Africa. Having published many short stories, novels and essays, Farah's prose has earned him, among other accolades, the Premio Cavour in Italy, the Kurt Tucholsky Prize in Sweden, and in 1998, the prestigious Neustadt International Prize for Literature. In the same year, the French edition of his novel Gifts also won the St. Malo Literature Festival's prize. \n\nThe music of the Ethiopian highlands uses a unique modal system called qenet, of which there are four main modes: tezeta, bati, ambassel, and anchihoy. Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor.  Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as tezeta, a song of reminiscence.\n\nIn the field of technology, the Great Stele of Axum, at over 100 ft long, was the largest single stone ever quarried in the ancient world. \n\nAdditionally, the glossy lifestyle magazine Sheeko is published quarterly for and by the Horn community.\n\nReligion\n\nMost residents in the Horn of Africa practice one of the three major Abrahamic faiths, religions that have had a longstanding presence in the region.\n\nAncient Axum produced coins and stelae associated with the disc and crescent symbols of the deity Ashtar.  The kingdom later became one of the earliest states to adopt Christianity, following the conversion of King Ezana II in the 4th century.\n\nIslam was introduced to the region early on from the Arabian peninsula, shortly after the hijra. At Muhammad's urging, a band of persecuted Muslims had fled across the Red Sea into the Horn. There, the Muslims were granted protection by the Aksumite King Aṣḥama ibn Abjar.  In the late 9th century, Al-Yaqubi wrote that Muslims were living along the northern Somali seaboard.  He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in Zeila,  suggesting that the Adal Sultanate with Zeila as its headquarters dates back to at least the 9th or 10th centuries.\n\nAdditionally, Judaism has a long presence in the region. The Kebra Negast (\"Book of the Glory of Kings\") relates that Israelite tribes arrived in Ethiopia with Menelik I, purported to be the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (Makeda). The legend relates that Menelik as an adult returned to his father in Jerusalem, and then resettled in Ethiopia, and that he took with him the Ark of the Covenant.  The Beta Israel today primarily follow the Orit (from Aramaic \"Oraita\" - \"Torah\"), which consists of the Five Books of Moses and the books Joshua, Judges and Ruth.\n\nA number of ethnic minority groups in southern Ethiopia also adhere to various traditional faiths. Among these belief systems are the Nilo-Saharan Surma people's acknowledgment of the sky god Tumu. \n\nSports\n\nIn the modern era, the Horn of Africa has produced several world-famous sports personalities, including long distance runners such as the world-record holder Kenenisa Bekele and Derartu Tulu, the first Ethiopian woman to win an Olympic gold medal and the only woman to have twice won the 10,000 meter Olympic gold in the short history of the event.\nOne of the most successful runners from the region has been Haile Gebrselassie  who was acclaimed as \"Athlete of the Year 1998\" by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). As well as numerous gold medals in various events, Gebrselassie achieved 15 world records and world bests in long and middle distance running, including world record marathon times in 2007 and 2008. Somali athlete Abdi Bile became a world champion when he won the 1500m for men at the 1987 World Championships in Athletics, running the final 800m of the race in 1:46.0, the fastest final 800m of any 1,500 meter track race in history.\n\nEritrea has established the cycling event the Tour of Eritrea.\n\nIn recent years, the Somali diaspora produced a football star in Ayub Daud, a midfielder who plays for Juventus in Italy's Serie A. Zahra Bani, a Somali-Italian javelin thrower, has garnered attention with her performances that so far have earned her adopted Italy a silver medal at the 2005 Mediterranean Games, as has Mo Farah, a Somali-British athlete that took gold for his adopted Great Britain in the 3000m at the 2009 European Indoor Championships in Turin and later golds in both the 10,000m and 5,000m at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nEconomy\n\nAccording to the IMF, in 2010 the Horn of Africa region had a total GDP (PPP) of $106.224 billion and nominal of $35.819 billion. Per capita, the GDP in 2010 was $1061 (PPP) and $358 (nominal).    \n\nStates of the region depend largely on a few key exports:\n* Economy of Ethiopia: Coffee 80% of total exports.\n* Economy of Somalia: Bananas and livestock over 50% of total exports.\nOver 95% of cross-border trade within the region is unofficial and undocumented, carried out by pastoralists trading livestock. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to other countries in the Horn and the wider Eastern Africa region, including Somalia and Djibouti, generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure).  This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allow disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments are unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.\n\nMuch of the Horn nations' trade links are with Middle Eastern countries. In 2011, an event hosted by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies in Doha, Qatar devoted several days of discussion to ways in which countries in the Horn region and the adjacent Arabian peninsula could further strengthen these historically close economic, social, cultural and religious ties.",
                "Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers six percent of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 percent of its total land area.Sayre, April Pulley (1999), Africa, Twenty-First Century Books. ISBN 0-7613-1367-2. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition. \n\nAfrica's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;   the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.  Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster – with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.  Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones. \n\nAfrica hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonized most of Africa. Most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonization in the 20th century.\n\nEtymology\n\nAfri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).   This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician  'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis  has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.  The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya. \n\nUnder Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.  The Latin suffix \"-ica\" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.\n\nAccording to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while \"Asia\" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of \"Africa\" expanded with their knowledge.\n\nOther etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name \"Africa\":\n* The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (Ant. 1.15) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.\n* Isidore of Seville in Etymologiae XIV.5.2. suggests \"Africa comes from the Latin aprica, meaning \"sunny\".\n* Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian af-rui-ka, meaning \"to turn toward the opening of the Ka.\" The Ka is the energetic double of every person and the \"opening of the Ka\" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, \"the birthplace.\" \n* Michèle Fruyt proposed  linking the Latin word with africus \"south wind\", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally \"rainy wind\".\n* Robert R. Stieglitz of Rutgers University proposed: \"The name Africa, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew Ophir.\" \n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory\n\nAfrica is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth, with the human species originating from the continent.   During the mid-20th century, anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (BPbefore present). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as Australopithecus afarensis (radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0 million years BP,  Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3–1.4 million years BP)  and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9 million–600,000 years BP) have been discovered.\n\nAfter the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers.    These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea,   the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco,  or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt. \n\nOther migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the Sahara. \n\nThe size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climactic conditions.  At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia.  However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.  The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.\n\nThe domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.  In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia.\n\nAround 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.  This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.\n\nBy the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,  and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. Copper objects from Egypt, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.\n\nEarly civilizations\n\nAt about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilization of Ancient Egypt.  One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC.   Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete. \n\nAn independent center of civilization with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north-west African coast at Carthage.   \n\nEuropean exploration of Africa began with Ancient Greeks and Romans. In 332 BC, Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian-occupied Egypt. He founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death. \n\nFollowing the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first Roman emperor native to North Africa was Septimius Severus, born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libya—his mother was Italian Roman and his father was Punic. \n\nChristianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia;  by AD 340 at the latest, it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire. Syro-Greek missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development. \n\nIn the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic center of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.\n\nNinth to eighteenth centuries\n\nPre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities  characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu-speaking peoples of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa; the large Sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan; Edo, Yoruba, and Igbo people in West Africa; and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa.\n\nBy the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire.  Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.\n\nIn the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu. The bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century. \n\nThe Kingdom of Ife, historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly oba ('king' or 'ruler' in the Yoruba language), called the Ooni of Ife.  Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural center in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture.  The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire, where its obas or kings, called the Alaafins of Oyo, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.\n\nThe Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.  The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized,  and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam. \n\nFollowing the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.  By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.\n\nHeight of slave trade\n\nSlavery had long been practiced in Africa.   Between the 7th and 20th centuries, Arab slave trade (also known as slavery in the East) took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean routes. Between the 15th and the 19th centuries (500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the New World.    More than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries. \n\nIn West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard. \n\nAction was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against \"the usurping King of Lagos\", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.  The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of \"legitimate commerce\" in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars. \n\nColonialism and the \"Scramble for Africa\"\n\nIn the late 19th century, the European imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: Ethiopia (known to Europeans as \"Abyssinia\"), and Liberia. Egypt and Sudan were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922.\n\nBerlin Conference\n\nThe Berlin Conference held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King Leopold II of Belgium, and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. It sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.\n\nIndependence struggles\n\nImperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France.  Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957),  becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.\n\nPortugal's overseas presence in Sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.\n\nPost-colonial Africa\n\nToday, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.\n\nGreat instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.\n\nCold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund, also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In Rhodesia, Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the country's white government. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.    The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people.  Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.\n\nIn the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China, which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as Africa Rising, can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone. \n\nGeography\n\nAfrica is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the Earth. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (transected by the Suez Canal), 163 km wide.  (Geopolitically, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa, as well.) \n\nFrom the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka in Tunisia (37°21' N), to the most southerly point, Cape Agulhas in South Africa (34°51'15\" S), is a distance of approximately ;  from Cape Verde, 17°33'22\" W, the westernmost point, to Ras Hafun in Somalia, 51°27'52\" E, the most easterly projection, is a distance of approximately .(1998) Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary (Index), Merriam-Webster, pp. 10–11.

(2002) The Kingfisher A-Z Encyclopedia, Kingfisher Publications. p. 11. ISBN 0-7534-5569-2 The smallest nation on the continental mainland is The Gambia.\n\nGeologically, Africa includes the Arabian Peninsula; the Zagros Mountains of Iran and the Anatolian Plateau of Turkey mark where the African Plate collided with Eurasia. The Afrotropic ecozone and the Saharo-Arabian desert to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the Afro-Asiatic language family unites the north linguistically.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of Africa ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily desert, or arid, while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and dense jungle (rainforest) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.  The record for the highest-ever recorded temperature, in Libya in 1922 (58 C), was discredited in 2013. (The 136 °F (57.8 °C), claimed by 'Aziziya, Libya, on 13 September 1922, has been officially deemed invalid by the World Meteorological Organization.) \n\nFauna\n\nAfrica boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and \"range of freedom\" of wild animal populations and diversity, with wild populations of large carnivores (such as lions, hyenas, and cheetahs) and herbivores (such as buffalo, elephants, camels, and giraffes) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of \"jungle\" animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians. In addition, Africa has the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna.\n\nEcology and biodiversity\n\nDeforestation is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).  According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world. Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West Africa have been destroyed.  Over 90% of Madagascar's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago.  About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation. \n\nAfrica has over 3,000 protected areas, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.\n\nPolitics\n\nThere are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states. For example, in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (former Zaire), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighboring African countries became involved (see also Second Congo War). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.\n\nThe African Union\n\nThe African Union (AU) is a 54-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states except Morocco. The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002  as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.\n\nThe African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.\n\nPolitical associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire.\n\nEconomy\n\nAlthough it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's poorest and most underdeveloped continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide).  According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African. \n\nPoverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the World Bank  announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). 80.5% of the Sub-Saharan Africa population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 85.7% for India. \n\nSub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,  indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programs spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.   \n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite,  64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves.  Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.  As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity. \n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id\n690 Malia Politzer, \"China and Africa: Stronger Economic Ties Mean More Migration\"], Migration Information Source. August 2008\n\nA Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. \"African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favored Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.\" \n\nDuring US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a US$7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new program named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US. \n\nDemographics\n\nAfrica's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.  The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.  As of 2014, the population of Africa is estimated at 1.2 billion.  Africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time - India and China's 1.4 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022. \n\nSpeakers of Bantu languages (part of the Niger–Congo family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from The Sahel progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.  But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (\"San\" or \"Bushmen\") and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also \"San\", closely related to, but distinct from \"Hottentots\") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa. \n\nThe peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger–Congo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.\n\nThe peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.  The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.\n\nPrior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.  Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa),  Kenya, Congo,  Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.  Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone.  Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Réunion, and the Republic of South Africa.  The country with the largest white African population is South Africa.  Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.\n\nEuropean colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively. \n\nLanguages\n\nBy most estimates, well over a thousand languages (UNESCO has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.  Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major language families indigenous to Africa:\n* The Afroasiatic languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the Horn of Africa, North Africa, the Sahel, and Southwest Asia.\n* The Nilo-Saharan language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, and northern Tanzania.\n* The Niger–Congo language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages.\n* The Khoisan languages number about fifty and are spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 120,000 people. Many of the Khoisan languages are endangered. The Khoi and San peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.\n\nFollowing the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see African French) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate.\n\nCulture\n\nSome aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practiced in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.  Leopold II of Belgium attempted to \"civilize\" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.\n\nObidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.  According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, \"The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art.\"   Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects \"lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions. Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that \"the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art.\"   In Soweto, the West Rand Administrative Board established a Cultural Section to collect, read, and review scripts before performances could occur.  Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the \"traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe.\"   On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies.\"  \n\nThere is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.\n\nVisual art and architecture\n\nAfrican art and architecture reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known beads were made from Nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.  The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world's tallest structure for 4,000 years, until the completion of Lincoln Cathedral around the year 1300. The stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the monolithic churches at Lalibela, Ethiopia, such as the Church of Saint George.\n\nMusic and dance\n\nEgypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and rock. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa. Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, Western influences are apparent due to colonization.\n\nSports\n\nFifty-three African countries have football (soccer) teams in the Confederation of African Football. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament, becoming the first African country to do so.\n\nCricket is popular in some African nations. South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. Morocco in northern Africa has also hosted the 2002 Morocco Cup, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. Rugby is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.\n\nReligion\n\nAfricans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive a topic for governments with mixed religious populations.[http://library.stanford.edu/africa/religion.html \"African Religion on the Internet\"], Stanford University According to the World Book Encyclopedia, Islam is the largest religion in Africa, followed by Christianity. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow traditional religions. A small number of Africans are Hindu, Buddhist, Confucianist, Baha'i, or have beliefs from the Judaic tradition. There is also a minority of Africans who are irreligious.\n\nTerritories and regions\n\nThe countries in this table are categorized according to the scheme for geographic subregions used by the United Nations, and data included are per sources in cross-referenced articles. Where they differ, provisos are clearly indicated.\n<!--"

It is the easternmost extension of African land and for the purposes of this article is defined as the region that is home to the countries of Djibouti , Eritrea , Ethiopia , and Somalia , whose cultures have been linked throughout their long history. Other definitions of the Horn of Africa are more restrictive and exclude some or all of the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, and Ethiopia. There are also broader definitions, the most common of which include all the countries mentioned above, as well as parts or all of Kenya , Sudan , South Sudan , and Uganda . Part of the Horn of Africa region is also known as the Somali peninsula; this term is typically used when referring to lands of Somalia and eastern Ethiopia.\nThe Horn contains such diverse areas as the highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau , the Ogaden desert, and the Eritrean and Somalian coasts and is home to the Amhara , Tigray , Oromo , and Somali peoples, among others. Its coasts are washed by the Red Sea , the Gulf of Aden , and the Indian Ocean , and it has long been in contact with the Arabian Peninsula and southwestern Asia . Islam and Christianity are of ancient standing here, and the people speak Afro-Asiatic languages related to those of North Africa and the Middle East .

Related subjects: African Geography\nNations of the Horn of Africa.\nThe Horn of Africa as seen from the NASA Space Shuttle, in May of 1993. The orange and tan colors in this image indicate a largely arid to semiarid climate.\nThe Horn of Africa (alternatively Northeast Africa, and sometimes Somali Peninsula) is a peninsula of East Africa that juts for hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea, and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. It is the easternmost projection of the African continent .\nIt indeed resembles in outline the horn of an animal — perhaps especially, the horns of the Black Rhinoceros , whose historic range includes parts of Ethiopia :\nIts orientation relative to the Equator approximates that of either rhino horn relative to the ground.\nThe angle between its northern and southeastern coasts approximates that at the tip of the rhino's upper horn.\nThe concavity of its northern coast, and convexity of its southern, echo similar curvatures on the rhino's lower horn.\nThe term also refers to the greater region containing the countries of Djibouti , Ethiopia , Eritrea and Somalia . As such, it covers approximately 2,000,000 km² and is inhabited by about 86.5 million people. Sudan and Kenya are sometimes included as well.\nGreater Somalia is a nationalist goal to create a unified Somali state in the Horn of Africa, in the former and present states referred to by the five points of the star in the national flag of Somalia since that country's independence: the former British and Italian colonies of present Somalia, the former French Somaliland (now Djibouti), the Ogaden in Ethiopia, and the North Eastern province in Kenya.\nGeography and climate\nThe Horn of Africa, almost equidistant from the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer, is an arid region.\nSocotra is a small island off the coast of Somalia, in the Indian Ocean, that is considered to be part of Africa. Its size is 3,600 square km. It is a territory of Yemen , the southernmost country on the Arabian peninsula.\nHistory\nAncient history\nThe Kingdom of Aksum (also known as \"Axum\") was an African state located in Ethiopia, Eritrea, northern Somalia and Yemen that thrived between the 1st and 7th centuries. Due to the Horn's strategic location, it has been used to restrict access to the Red Sea in the past.\nThe region was also a source of biological resources during the Antiquity: The ancient Egyptians , Greeks and Romans sent expeditions to the region for frankincense, myrrh, dragon's blood or cinnabar and took these commodities back along the Incense Route. Therefore the Romans called this region Regio Aromatica.\nModern history\nThe Horn of Africa is a region continuously in crisis. Ethiopia occupies a predominant position in the Horn because of its demographic importance: about 85% of the area's population live in this country. Yet Ethiopia's history is largely marked by conflicts between Muslims and Christians for resources and living space, as well as between nationalism and Marxism-Leninism in the modern times. The rest of the region also faces continuous wars: a civil war erupted in Somalia in 1977, resulting in the country having had no functioning national government since 1991. Sudan , with the Sudanese Civil War, represents another important source of instability for the whole region. Conflicts have also occurred in Djibouti and Eritrea.\nMoreover, the region is regularly stricken by natural catastrophes , such as droughts (in Ethiopia) or flood (Somalia) that hit rural areas particularly hard. As a result, the region has some of the world's highest levels of malnutrition and is continuously loomed by a major humanitarian crisis. Between 1982 and 1992, about two million people died in the Horn of Africa due to this combination of war and famine .\nThe Horn of Africa, since 2002, has been a major focus of attention by the United States , France , Germany , and eleven African nations regarding the so-called War on Terrorism.\nCulture and ethnicity\nThe countries of the Horn of Africa are culturally linked together. Local people have been using the plow for cultivation and kept the Arabian dromedary as domestic animals for a long time. Some important ethno-linguistic groups in the Horn of Africa are:\nIn Djibouti: the Afar (Danakil) and the Somali (Issa)\nIn Eritrea: the Bilen, the Afar, the Beni-Amer ( Beja), the Hedareb, the Kunama (Baza), the Nara (Nialetic), the Saho (Irob), the Rashaida, the Tigre, and the Tigrinya. The Jebertis are Muslim Tigrinyas who consider themselves as a separate ethnicity, but are not recognized by other sources.\nIn Ethiopia: Amharas, Afars, Agaw groups, Gurages, Hamers, Hararis (also Hadere or Adere), the Irob (Catholic Sahos) Oromos, Saho, Sidamas, Somalis, and Tigrayans, as well as many other small groups (see also ethnicities listed at Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region).\nIn Somalia: the Dabarre, the Digil-Rahawlin, the Garre, the Jiiddu, the Shambaara (Gosha), the Somali, the Swahili (Baraawe) and the Tunni.\nIn Sudan: the Anuak, the Atwot, the Bale, the Beni-Amer (Beja), the Bisharin (Beja), the Burun (Barun, Borun), the Dar Fur Daju, the Dar Sila Daju, the Didinga (Xaroxa, Toil), the Fedicca-Mahas, the Nubian, the Fulani (Sudanese Fula), the Fur (Furawi), the Chulfan (Gulfan), the Gule (Fung, Hameg), the Hadendoa (Beja), the Hamar, the Hausa Fulani, the Ingessana (Tabi), the Kanga (Abu Sinun), the Yerwa Kanuri, the Katla (Akalak), the Kenuzi-Dongolese, the Nubi, the Central Koma (Komo), the Krongo Nuba, the Maba (Borgu, Mabang), the Maban-Jumjum (Maben), the Mararit (Ablyl, Ebiri, Masalit), the Masalit, the Mesakin (Masakin), the Midob (Miedob, Tidi), the Nyimang (Nyima, Ama), the Par (Lokoro), the Rufaa (Rufalyin), the Shatt (Daju), the Shatt (Mandul), the Sungor (Assagori), the Tagale (Taqalawin), the Temein, the tigre, the Tira (Thiro), the Tulishi and the Zaghawa.\nEconomy",
                "The Economist explains: Everything you want to know about migration across the Mediterranean | The Economist\nEverything you want to know about migration across the Mediterranean\nMay 4th 2015, 14:27\nTweet\nWhat does the Mediterranean journey actually entail?\nMigrants leaving from north Africa for Italy do so overwhelmingly from Libya, though there are also routes to Italy from Egypt and Morocco, and from Turkey to Greece. A 2013 report for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), by Altai consulting, estimates that the cost of getting to Libya varies from about $200 to $1,000 from west Africa, and from about $1,000 to $6,000 from the Horn of Africa. Subsequent transit by sea runs from a few hundred dollars to a couple of thousand. At the coast passengers are either loaded onto rigid inflatable boats with limited fuel and no captain or guide to help them or are herded onto rickety fishing boats which do have a skipper and crew.\nThe journey from Libya to Italy is a couple of hundred kilometres—less than a day's sail—but the boats are not necessarily intended to get all the way. Once clear of the Libyan coast, a distress call is made in the hope that the migrants will be picked up either by a passing merchant ship or fishing boat or by the Italian or Maltese coast guards. In cases where the vessel is crewed, the crew members flee or try to pass as migrants, often successfully.\nWhy are people risking this awful journey?\nBecause they are fleeing some mixture of war, oppression, civil disorder and poverty. Most of the migrants are young men. They make their journeys in sections, stopping and working at various places along the route. According to Italian estimates there are between 500,000 and one million currently in Libya awaiting passage; living conditions are usually bad, but most migrants have no way back to where they came from.\nWhere are most migrants coming from?\nThe make-up of the flows has changed over the years. Migrants currently come mainly from west Africa, the horn of Africa and, since 2013, Syria. Last year, according to the UNHCR, 31% of arrivals were Syrians, and 18% were fleeing Eritrea. So far this year the flow to Italy is dominated by migrants from the Gambia, Senegal and Somalia. There are routes through the Sahara from both west Africa and the Horn of Africa; there are also some routes along the Mediterranean coast. For many of the communities along the way the traffic in would-be migrants is now a dominant part of the local economy. (Story continues below the chart)\nWhere do they end up?\nThe vast majority of those who leave Libya end up in Italy—often the small island of Lampedusa. Greece and Malta are also common destinations. The European Union's Dublin regulation says that the first EU country a migrant gets to must take responsibility for him; southern countries say this puts puts a great deal of the burden of border management on them. Germany, France and Britain, though, say they end up taking more refugees and migrants, both because of migration along other routes (for example, through the Balkans) and because southerners encourage migrants to move northwards. Reaching an agreement on an equitable distribution of the burden has not yet proved possible, largely because of political sensitivity to immigration in northern countries. On a per capita basis, Sweden has taken by far the largest share of Europe’s Syrian refugees.\nWhy is the journey so dangerous? Don't people sail around safely on the Med all the time?\nThe boats used are old and often of dubious seaworthiness; their crews often abandon them. They are also severely overcrowded. The boat that sank on April 19th was about 20 metres long and carrying more than 900 people, many of them locked below decks; it appears to have capsized when those on deck rushed to one side, seeking to board a ship offering to rescue them.\nIs migration becoming more dangerous over time? Why are more people dying?\nThe UNHCR estimates that 26,165 migrants have reached the shores of Italy this year, a similar number to the 26,644 who arrived in the first four months of 2014. However in the first four months of 2014 only 96 are thought to have died, as opposed to an estimated 1,700 so far this year. The main difference in circumstance is that in early 2014 the Italian navy was operating a thoroughgoing interception operation called Mare Nostrum, which was set up after an earlier wreck off Lampedusa in which hundreds died. Mare Nostrum intercepted ships carrying migrants in international waters and became the de facto last stage of most migrants’ journey to Europe. More than 140,000 people were taken on board its ships from October 2013 to October 2014. At that point it was replaced by an operation called Triton , run by the EU’s border agency, Frontex, which only operates within 50km of the Italian coast. Among the arguments for this new, cheaper option was the idea that, if shutting down Mare Nostrum made the passage riskier, then fewer would attempt it. This appears not to have been the case; the change of policy seems simply to have driven the death toll up. (Story continues below the chart)\nWhat could reasonably be done to reduce the number of deaths?\nReinstating a programme along the lines of Mare Nostrum would almost certainly reduce the number of migrants lost at sea. At an EU summit convened in late April, in response to a growing death toll, leaders agree to triple funding for Operation Triton. A full reintroduction of Mare Nostrum was ruled out, however.\nFor something more ambitious to work, a better way of distributing the refugees around Europe will be necessary. Operations aimed at destroying the smugglers’ ships have been mooted, but pose several risks: military action might increase instability in Libya while encouraging the smugglers to use smaller yet less-seaworthy boats. Peace and a return to effective government control along the Libyan coast could bring with it the sort of stability that lets people earn their living from work other than smuggling, as well as a police presence capable of reining in illegal migration. Yet bringing peace to North Africa and the Middle East is an even  harder problem than ending the migration crisis. Doing more for Syrian refugees in other Arab countries might help, but given the large number of migrants already in Libya it would take time to have any effect. It is also possible that applications for European asylum could be processed in north Africa, but although this idea has been gaining support there has been no concrete progress. Again, it is unlikely to be workable without a resolution to the impasse over the distribution of refugees across Europe.\nThis piece has been updated to reflect news.\nDig deeper:",

And it was from this physical and genetic diversity that allowed Africans to parent the rest of humanity. Indigenous Africa is testimony to the full spectrum, of skin tones, hair textures, rich religious and cultural practices. However, all  this diversity has a political destiny which merges into one African family .\nLanguage  African Reality\nAfrican: is a term which super-umbrellas all the indigenous ethnicities of the African continent. Therefore an African is exclusively a person from the indigenous ethnic groups found on the continent of Africa and people who trace their ancestry to these groups in the African Diaspora.  ( African Race ) There are at least 3,000 distinct ethnic groups in Africa. Africans, in full diversity, are the natural people of the African landscape. The hair, the skin, are all specific adaptations to living in the African landscape.\nMOTHERLAND:  is an epic and unprecedented entry into the canon of African-owned cinema, which charts the glory and majesty of the Motherland (Enat Hager).\nMotherland is a film that unapologetically calls for African unity, self-determination and the African rebirth. ON DVD\n \n \nThere is more genetic diversity between different African people than between all the races of the world combined. So the difference between Asian and European is less than between Amhara and Hausa.\n \nAHS\nAfrica has 3000 distinct ethnic groups, 2000 languages. Home to the most genetically diverse people on Earth. So diverse that two Africans are more genetically different from each other than a Chinese and a European are from each other. Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.2 million km², it covers six percent of the Earth's total surface area and 20.4 percent of the total land area. With approximately 58 countries. It occupies a wide dynamic latitude has; deserts, forest, snow, temperate climate, tropics, sub-tropics, lakes, the longest river, lowest point on Earth, mountain ranges. Now we have to ponder over these figures when we have these vulgar sweeping generalizations, which fit all of this diversity into one and two monolithic boxes. There are generalizations, which do define Africa, but none that are exclusive.\nFor linguistic notes on pejorative and racist words such as Black African and Sub-Saharan Africa .

They are located primarily in the central highland plateau of Ethiopia and comprise the major population element in the provinces of Begemder and Gojjam and in parts of Shoa and Wallo.\nAmhara (አማራ) is an ethnic group in the central highlands of Ethiopia , numbering about 19 million, making up 30.2% of the country's population according to the most recent 1994 census. They speak Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia, and culturally and politically dominant. Christianity , with the Ethiopian Orthodox\nZulu\nRELIGION: Church playing a central role in the culture of the country and of the Amharic ethnic group. According to the 1994 census, 81.5% of the Amhara Region of Ethiopia were Ethiopian Orthodox, with 18.1% being Muslim , and 0.1% being Protestant. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church maintains close links with the Egyptian Coptic Church. Timkut, Meskel(commemorating the discovery of the True Cross by Queen Eleni  in the fourth century), Genet (Xmas 7th Jan), Easter and Epiphany are the most important celebrations, marked with services, feasting and dancing. Most holidays are unique to Ethiopia .\nLANGUAGE: Amhara (አማርኛ āmariññā) It is the second   most spoken Semitic language in the world, after Arabic. As well as the 2nd largest of the Afro-Asiatic languages (again after Arabic). Amharic has 27 million speakers as a first language, between 7-15 million more as a second language. It is written, with some adaptations, with the Ge'ez alphabet— called, in Ethiopian Semitic languages, ፊደል fidel ('alphabet,' 'letter,' or 'character') and አቡጊዳ abugida\nThe mother and child remain in the house, for forty days after birth of a boy, eighty for a girl, before going to the church for baptism. A priest usually attends the house to perform circumsissions (male child) as well as blessings. Marriages conducted in a church are not subject to divorce. Weddings celebrations are held by both households called መልስ Mels. Some time in the late middle ages, the Amharic and Tigrinya languages began to be differentiated. Amhara warlords often competed for dominance of the realm with Tigrayan warlords. While mkbv.any branches of the Imperial dynasty were from the Amharic speaking area, a substantial amount were from Tigray. The Amharas seemed to gain the upper hand with the accession of the so-called Gondar line of the Imperial dynasty in the beginning of the 17th century. However, it soon lapsed into the semi-anarchic era of Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Princes\"), in which rivalling warlords fought for power and the Yejju Oromo inderases (or regents) had effective control, while emperors were just as figureheads.\nThe Tigrayans only made a brief return to the throne in the person of Yohannes IV, whose death in 1889 allowed the base to return to the Amharic speaking province of Shewa. Historians generally consider the Amhara to have been Ethiopia's ruling elite for centuries, represented by the line of Emperors ending in Haile Selassie.  One possible source of confusion for this stems from the mislabeling of all Amharic-speakers as \"Amhara\", and the fact that many people from other ethnic groups have Amharic names. Another is the fact that most Ethiopians can trace their ancestry to multiple ethnic groups. In fact, the last Emperor, Haile Selassie I, often counted himself a member of the Gurage ethnic group on account of his ancestry, and his Empress, Itege Menen Asfaw of Ambassel, was in large part of Oromo descent. The expanded use of Amharic language results mostly from its being the language of the court, and was gradually adopted out of usefulness by many unrelated groups, who then became known as \"Amhara\" no matter what their ethnic origin. (multi-ethnicity who identify as Amhara, just like Zulu people )\nMARRIAGE\nRETURN\nAfar\nThe Afar people live primarily in Ethiopia and the areas of Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia in the Horn of Africa . They are know for their hostility to foreigners and for the notorious ritual of taken male genitalia as trophies. The Afar are an Muslim people related to the Oromo people.\nAsante\nAshanti (people) or Asante, African people of the Twi (Tshi) linguistic   stock, living principally in the Ashanti region of   Ghana. The Ashanti people are composed of numerous tribes, notably   the Dwaben, Mampon, Ofinsu, Nkwanta, Adansi, Daniassi, Nsuta, and Kumasi.   Features of Ashanti tribal organization include ruling chieftains and common   ownership of land. Ashanti religion is a mixture of animism and   ancestor worship, and in the past human sacrifice was practiced.   Renowned as warriors and as artisans—especially in cotton weaving, pottery   making, and the manufacture of gold and silver ornaments—the Ashanti also are   skillful farmers.\nAnlo-Ewe\nThe Anlo-Ewe people are today in the southeastern corner of the Republic of Ghana. They settled here around 1474 after escaping from their past home of Notsie.\n \nB\nBantu People (Zulu, Shona, etc)\nThe Bantu first originated around the Benue-Cross rivers area in southeastern   Nigeria and spread over Africa to the Zambia area. Sometime in the second   millennium BC, perhaps triggered by the drying of the Sahara and pressure from   the migration of people from the Sahara into the region, they were forced to   expand into the rainforests of central Africa (phase I). In the 1st millennium   BC, they began a more rapid second phase of expansion beyond the forests into   southern and eastern Africa, and again in the 1st millennium AD as new   agricultural techniques and plants were developed in Zambia.\nBy about AD 1000 it   had reached modern day Zimbabwe and South Africa. In Zimbabwe a major southern   hemisphere empire was established, with its capital at Great Zimbabwe.\nBeja\nIdentity/Location\nSudan, Eritrea,\nThe Beja are nomadic people that live mainly in the Red Sea Hills of the Sudan. This mountainous, semi-desert region lies parallel to the Red Sea coast from southeastern Egypt through northeastern Sudan into Eritrea.\nThe Beja roam these mountains between the Red Sea and the Nile and Atbara rivers and also the plains that slope down westwards to the Nile river valley. They are a non-Arab, Hamitic people, numbering 1.8 million, who call themselves Bedawiyet and speak a Cushitic language called To-Bedawiye. Most Beja speak some Arabic as a second language, and in the south some of them speak Tigre.\nThere are five main Beja  groups - the Hadendowa, the Bisharin, the Amar'ar, the Bani-Amir and the 'Ababda. Each group is subdivided into tribes and clans within the tribe. The Hadendowa developed into a tribal group around 1600 and are the largest and most important Beja group today. They live between the Atbara River and the Red Sea, reaching as far south as the Eritrean border. Traditionally they were camel breeders and caravan guides. Some of them are now settled farmers growing cotton and other crops in the Gash and Baraka River deltas near Kassala. The Bisharin emerged as a distinct tribal group sometime between 1000 and 1400 AD claiming an Arab ancestor called Bishar ibn-Marwan ibn-Ishaq ibn-Rabi'a. They have the largest territory of all Beja groups, stretching north of the Atbara-Port-Sudan railway line into Egypt. Most are still camel breeders, but some have settled as farmers near the Atbara River. The Ammar'ar developed into a tribal group around 1750. They live on the eastern slopes of the Red Sea Hills and in the coastal plain north of Port-Sudan (Gunob), and are still mainly nomads though many work as dock hands in the Port-Sudan harbour. The Beni-'Amir (also called Khasa) are mainly Tigre speaking Beja with some To-Bedawiye speaking sections living amongst them. They live on both sides of the Sudan-Eritrea border and have been Muslim for only about two centuries. Traditionally camel owners, some herd cattle and others are farmers. They are the only Beja to have a caste system, being divided into nobles called Nabtabs who claim Arab descent, and serfs or clients called Tigre.\nBaka People\nA people of hunters and gatherers, Baka 'Pygmies' live in the rainforest of   Cameroon, together with various ethnic groups of bantu farmers, with whom they   exchange goods and have a symbiotic relationship from time immemorial.\nLike the other groups of African 'Pygmies' (BaKola, Aka, BaBongo, BaMbuti,   etc.), the Baka are traditionally nomadic, even though they are undergoing a   process of sedentariness under the influence of multiple factors. The first of   these factors is massive deforestation, which deprives the Pygmies of the   natural and symbolic resources essential for their biological and cultural   survival. They are also persecuted by Bantu people and often viewed as 2nd class citizens.\n \nD\nDinka People\nDinka, indigenous people of the Republic of Sudan in Africa , one of the largest indigenous groups in the south of the country. Since about the 10th century they have inhabited an area along both sides of the White Nile. Dinka people typically are tall and slim, have very dark skin, and almond-shaped eyes. Male Dinka between the ages of 10 and 16 have their foreheads marked with scarification (see Tattooing) during an initiation ceremony into their particular  group. The Dinka speak five Dinka languages from the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family. A pastoral people, they raise herds of cattle, sheep, and goats for their livelihood. Cattle are extremely important to the Dinka culture and a symbol of wealth; milk in many forms is hence a primary food. However, the long-running civil war in Sudan has resulted in much-reduced herds and consequential changes in some of their cultural practices.\nThe traditional Dinka religion is a form of polytheistic animism, but some Christianity is practised. The religion is dominated by the god Nhialic (Sky), who speaks through spirits that take possession of individuals. The sacrifice of oxen, carried out by leaders known as the Spear-Masters, is an important aspect of the faith. The Spear-Masters guide the destiny of the people.\nThe Dinkas social system is headed by chiefs who also serve as priests and peacemakers. Currently, about 500,000 Dinka live in Sudan. Famous Dinka include Alek Wek.\nPrimary language: Fulfulde (90% speakers)\nSecond language: Hausa\nPrimary Language: Fulfulde\nEthnologue Code: FUE\nDialects: Kano-Katsina-Bororro (Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria), Bagirmi, Sokoto The Fulani people of West Africa are the   largest nomadic group in the world.\nTotal People: 15 million Fulani with 100,000 Wodaabe\nUrban Percent: 10% Fulani\nCountries: Niger 1 million; Mali 1 million; Cameroon 700,000; Burkina Faso 500,000; Benin 230,000; Sudan 100,000; Togo 50,000; Central African Republic 25,000; Ghana 5,000; Nigeria 11 million. (Wodaabe: more than 40,000 in Niger and about 25,000 in Chad).\nZulu\nAs a people group they actually contain a large number of people from   diverse groups who were conquered and became a part of the Fulani through the   spread of Muslim . The Fulani were able to take   over much of West Africa and establish themselves not only as a religious force   but also as a political and economical force. The Fulani are a very proud   people, they are the missionaries of Islam and ended up conquering much of West Africa . The Fulani are primarily nomadic herders and traders. Through   their nomadic lifestyle, they established numerous trade routes in West Africa.   Many times the Fulani go to local marketers and interact with the people there   getting news and spreading it through much of West Africa.\nFulani  have a huge respect for beauty. Beauty is considered very   important and one of the ways this is shown is through tattoos that are put all   over the body. A distinguishing feature of a Fulani can be their lips, which are   many times a blackish color from the use of Henna or tattooing done on the   mouth.\nBeing brave and fearless are very important for the Fulani as is seen by   their numerous weapons. One tradition is that when 2 boys reach coming of age   they two boys hit each other with their staffs not showing any pain but instead   laughing. Many have died in these ceremonies which are now against the law in   many countries but continue to be practiced.\nThe Fulani normally raise   large amounts of cattle and have therefore settled in large plain areas of Mali,   Niger, Burkina Faso and Guinea. The Fulani hold to a strict caste system. The 4   caste subdivisions are the nobility, merchants, blacksmiths, and descendents of   slaves of wealthy Fulani.\nThe most important object in Fulani society is cattle, and there   are many names, traditions, and taboos concerning cattle. The number of cows a   person owns is a sign of his wealth. This has caused significant conflict in   recent months between the Fulani and other ethnic groups. The reason for this is   that the cows will many times go into the fields and eat the grain of local   farmers. With increasing numbers of other transportation being used the Fulani   are at risk of losing their identity as nomads and are being forced to settle in   farms and villages. This sometimes creates other problems, because the Fulani   are very proud people of their unique culture and used to ruling over the other   people.\nEconomics\nIncome: GDP US$280 (1991)\nOccupations: While the men herd the cattle walking, the women ride with all their household belongings on the backs of donkeys. As well as fine cattle with huge horns, the Fulani have long legged sheep which have white hindquarters and black front half. The activities of the men vary with the seasons. They can have their brothers or sons replace them to take care of the cows. The women milk the cows, pound the millet, take care of the fire and look after the children.\nIncome sources: Cows (milk, meat, skins), traditional medicine. Some women earn money by braiding hair.                              Products: Curdled milk, butter.\nHandcrafts: Beautifully decorated calabashes.                              Art forms: They are largely illiterate, but their culture abounds in rich proverbs, fables, myths and riddles, which subtly reflect the basic views and values.\nLiving Conditions/Community Development Status\nFood: Their food is milk and very little else in the bush. They might also eat millet and tapioca. During feasts they will eat some meat and maybe some beans. No vegetables are eaten, in general. A problem is that the little money they have available for food is spent on tea instead of on nutritious food.                              Clothing: The man wears a tanned sheepskin around his hips, over this a black tunic. He also wears a turban. The married women do not cover their breasts for the 2 years after they have their first child. The young girls wrap a long piece of material around, made of woven strips sown together.\n \nH\nHadza\nThe Hadzabe are a small groups of Hadzabe  live around Lake Eyasi. Their language resembles   the click languages of Khoisan further south in the Kalahari. Their small   population was seriously threatened, in particular during the period when Julius   Nyere tried to introduce his Ujuma policy.\nHamer\nLanguage: Hamer-Banna. 42,838 Hammer language speakers\nNeighboring Peoples: Banna.\nHistory: They belong to a group of culturally distinct people known as the   Sidamo.\nEconomy: Most of the Hamer are cattle breeders.\nReligion: 95% Sunni Muslim\nReligion: The Hamer-Banna are 95% Sunni Muslim . They observe the five basic   teachings of Muslim , which include acknowledging that Allah is the only god,   praying, fasting, giving alms to the poor, and making a pilgrimage to Mecca.   However, many elements of their traditional religion are still practiced. For   instance, they believe that natural objects (rocks, trees, etc.) have spirits.   They also believe in jinns, or spiritsthat are capable of assuming human or   animal form and exercising supernatural influence over people.\nSocial System: The Hamer   live in camps that consist of several related families. The families live in   tents arranged in a circle, and the cattleare brought into the center of the   camp at night. When the campsite is being set up, beds for the women and young   children are built first; then the tent frame is built around it. The tents are   constructed with flexible poles set in the ground in a circular pattern. The   poles are bent upward, joining at the top, then tied. The structures are covered   with thatch during the dry season and canvas mats during the rainy season. Men   and boys usually sleep on cots in the center of the camp, near the cattle. Herds   belonging to the Hamer-Banna consist mainly of cattle, although there are some   sheep and goats. Camels are used for riding and as pack animals.\nMost   Hamer-Banna plant fields of sorghum at the beginning of the rainy season before   leaving on their annual nomadic journey. Some households also plant sesame and   beans. Because the crops are usually leftunattended, the yields are low. Few   households grow enough grain to last through the year.\nOne striking   characteristic of the Hamer-Banna men and women is that they indulge in   elaborate hair-dressing. They wear a clay \"cap\" that is painted and decorated   with feathers and other ornaments. Much time is spent inpreparing the hair, and   care must be taken to protect it from damage. This is one reason the men often   sleep on small, cushioned stools. The women use the butter for the perfect look   manteinance of their hair-dressing. A well-dressed man will wear a toga-like   cloth and carry a spear and a stool. Women also commonly wear colorful toga-like   garments. Men may marry as many women as they like, but only within their own   ethnicity. A \"bride price\" of cattle and other goods is provided by the   prospectivehusband and his near relatives. A typical household consists of a   woman, her children, and a male protector. A man may be the protector of more   than one household, depending on the number of wives he has.\nCULTURE TRADITIONS (MAINLY PRE-ISLAMIC)\nThe maza are also responsible for a ritual whipping which precedes the main cattle jump. The village's women  purposefully provoke the maza into lashing their bare backs with sticks which inflict raw, open wounds and scar them for life. However, these wounds are seen as the mark of a true Hamar woman, and the pain is worn with honor. Because the sister or relative was whipped at the man's ceremony and endured the pain for him she can later in life look to him for help if she falls on hard times because she has the scars from the whipping she received for him to prove his debt to her.\nWomen commonly end up as the heads of families because they marry men who are much older than themselves while they are young. When her husband dies she is left in control of the family's affairs and livestock. She is also in control of his younger brothers and their livestock if their parents are dead. Widows may not re-marry.                              Also, men are   sometimes assigned the responsibility of protecting a divorced woman, a widow,   or the wife of an absent husband (usually his brother). Marriage celebrations   include feasting and dancing. Young girls as well as boys are circumcised.\n \nHausa\nPopulation: 10-15 Million\nlanguage: Nigeria, Niger, and other   parts of eastern West Africa, belonging to the Chadic branch of Afro-Asiatic. 25   million.40 million.\nReligion: 100% Sunni Muslim\nOriginally organized into a group of feudal city-states, the Hausa were conquered from the 14th century on by a succession of West African kingdoms—among them, Mali, Songhai, Bornu, and Fulani. The Hausa occasionally attained enough power and unity, however, to throw off foreign domination and to engage in local conquest and slave raiding themselves. In the opening years of the 20th century, with the Hausa on the verge of overthrowing the Fulani, the British invaded northern Nigeria and instituted their policy of indirect rule. Under the British the Fulani were supported in their political supremacy, and the Hausa—Fulani ruling coalition, still dominant in northern Nigeria, was confirmed.\nThe beginnings of this coalition were, however, much earlier, because the Fulani governed simply by assuming the highest hereditary positions in the well-organized Hausa political system. Many of the ruling Fulani have now become culturally and linguistically Hausa.                                 Hausa culture manifests a greater degree of specialization and diversification than that of most of the surrounding peoples. Subsistence agriculture is the primary occupation of most, but other skills such as tanning, dyeing, weaving, and metalworking are also highly developed.\nThe Hausa have long been famous for wide-ranging itinerant trading, and wealthy merchants share the highest social positions with the politically powerful and the highly educated. Hausa architecture is distinctive: houses are made from cone-shaped mud bricks with wooden beams (from palm trunks) for the roof. They often have a dome-shaped room constructed from wooden frames that form arches and are then covered in mud.\nThe Hausa language is the largest and best-known member of the Chadic subfamily of the Afro-Asiatic family of languages. Hausa has borrowed freely from other languages, especially Arabic, and is adapting well to the demands of contemporary cultural change. It has become a common language for millions of non-Hausa West Africans, and sizeable Hausa-speaking communities exist in each major city of West and North Africa as well as along the trans-Saharan trade and pilgrimage routes. Extensive literature and several periodicals in Romanized script have been produced since the beginning of British rule. An Arabic-based writing system (ajami), developed before the British conquest, is still in limited use. Indigenous Hausa names are rare. Babies are named one week after birth.\n \nI\nIgbo\nThe Igbo of southeastern Nigeria traditionally live in small, independent   villages, each with an elected council rather than a chief. Such democratic   institutions notwithstanding, Igbo society is highly stratified along lines of   wealth, achievement, and social rank. Overcrowding and degraded soil have forced   many Igbo to migrate to nearby cities and other parts of Nigeria.\n \nRegion: Nigeria, southeast Niger, western Chad and northern Cameroon.\nLanguage: Kanuri (Nilo-Saharan), Hausa, Arabic or Fulfulde - Varies by country\nThird language: French\nRegion: Islam\nPopulation Total People: 4 million  (estimate)\nThe Kanuri were Initially Pastoral Berber, the Kanuri were driven from North Africa by Arabs, moving to the area around Lake Chad in the late seventh century, and absorbed migrants from the Upper Nile. According to Kanuri tradition, Sef, son of Dhu Ifazan of Yemen, arrived in Kanem in the ninth century and united the population into the Sayfawa dynasty. The Kanuri are tall and very dark in appearance, with a stately, dignified   look. This signifies their pride and appreciation for their past as rulers, as   well as their present position of leadership and influence. Many Kanuri speak   Hausa, Arabic, or another area language in addition to Kanuri.\nHISTORY: The Kanuri began losing power in this region when the British took control in   1914. Nevertheless, they have remained politically active and still have much   influence on the surrounding people groups. In fact, aspects of Kanuri culture,   language, and religion have been adopted by many of the neighboring groups.\nKhoisan/KhoiKhoi\nKhoisan (increasingly commonly spelled Khoesan or Khoe-San)  is the name for two of the oldest ethnic groups of southern Africa and thus the  entire human race. From the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic period, hunting  and gathering cultures known as the Sangoan occupied southern Africa in areas.  Both the  San and Khoikhoi (men of men)  people resemble the ancient Sangoan skeletal remains.\nZulu\nBoth share physical and  linguistic characteristics, and it seems clear that the Khoi branched forth  from the San by adopting the practice of herding cattle and goats from neighbouring  Bantu groups. The Khoisan people were the original inhabitants of much of  southern Africa before the southward Bantu migrations (starting 1000 B.C.E)—coming  down the east and west coasts of Africa—and later European colonialism who  called them ‘Bushmen’ and Hottentots, the later is considered obsolete and  offensive, while Bushmen (a pejorative Colonial impression of these people) is  diminishing in use. More commonly called San ( although this can be interpreted  as derogatory as it is a word from the Khoikhoi to refer to the so-called San,  just as Amhara call Beta-Israeli people Falasha (foreigner) and hence the word  is un-academic)\nThe Khoisan languages are noted for their click consonants. Which  have no alphabetical equivalent in any script. Over the centuries the many  branches of the Khoisan peoples were absorbed or displaced by the ‘colonial’  Bantu who were migrating south in search of  new lands, most notably the Xhosa and Zulu, who both have adopted some Khoisan  clicks and loan words into their respective languages.\nThe Khoisan survived in the desert or in areas with winter rains which were not suitable for Bantu  crops.\nDuring the colonial era they lived in South Africa, Namibia and  Botswana, and were massacred in great numbers by Dutch, British, and German  settlers in acts of genocide (e.g. the Herero and Namaqua Genocide).  They contributed greatly to the ancestry of  South Africa's coloured population. Today many of the San live in parts of the  Kalahari Desert where they are better able to preserve much of their cherished  culture.\nGenetically their  Y-haplogroup  A, the most diverse or oldest-diverging Y haplogroup transmitted purely by  patrilineal descent, is today present in various Khoisan groups at frequencies  of 12-44%, and the other Y-haplogroups present have been formed by recent  admixture of Bantu male lineages E3a (18-54%), and in some groups, noticeable  Pygmy traces are visible (B2b). The Khoisan also show the largest genetic  diversity in matrilineally transmitted mtDNA of all human populations. Their  original mtDNA haplogroups L1d and L1k are one of the oldest-diverging female  lineages as well. However, analysis of neutral autosomal (inherited through  either parent) genes finds that the Khoisan are similar to other African  populations.\nThe presence of Haplogroup A, especially the subclade A3b2,  in East Africa suggests some ancient connection between those populations and  the Khoisan. This may not be a simple migration in one direction, but the  result of various movements of people in Eastern and Southern Africa over tens  of thousands of years, followed by the recent Bantu expansion separating the  two regions.One interpretation is that the Khoisan are the earliest-diverging  human group, or even a group that has preserved the original human lifestyle  along with genetics.\nL\nLemba\nThe Lemba are members of an ancient Jewish sect who live in modern day Zimbabwe. Many of their cultural practice are of Jewish origin. Genetically they have more 'Jewish' DNA than most Israelis today.The name \"Lemba\" may originate in chilemba, a Swahili word for turbans worn by East Africans or lembi a Bantu word meaning \"non-African\" or \"respected foreigner.\" According to some Lemba, they had male ancestors who were Jews who left Judea about 2,500 years ago and settled in a place called Senna (Yemen), later migrating into East Africa.\n \nMany Lemba beliefs and practices can be linked to Judaism:\nThey are monotheists (they call their creator God Nwali).\nThey hold one day of the week to be holy and praise Nwali (similar to the Jewish Shabbat).\nThey praise Nwali for looking after the Lemba, considering themselves a chosen people.\nThey teach their children to honor their mothers and fathers.\nThey refrain from eating pork or other foods forbidden by the Torah, or forbidden combinations of permitted foods.\nTheir form of animal slaughter, which makes meats fit for their consumption, resembles Jewish shechita.\nThey practise male circumcision; (furthermore, according to Junod, surrounding tribes regarded them as the masters and originators of that art).\nThey place a Star of David on their tombstones.\nLembas are discouraged from marrying non-Lembas, as Jews are discouraged from marrying non-Jews.\nM\nMasai\nThe Masai are members of the Nilotic tribal group along with the Samburu. The   Masai are a well known colorful people who are mainly cattle and goat herders.   They like to adorn themselves with colorful cloth and beads. Wealth is measured   in cattle. The traditional villages surround a central area. The young males go   through a period of warriorhood before they marry.\nMen generally make the tribal   decisions and care for the cattle. The women build the houses and talke care of   the home. More and more villages are becoming less traditional. This can be seen   by flat metal roofs instead of thatching, all wooden houses and even farm plots.   Growing food is frowned upon by traditional Masai. There are even some homes   with satellite dishes. In villages near lodges, income is supplemented by posing   for photos, selling used spears or performing tradtional dances.\nEach family marks its cattle with a unique brand and ear slits to identify them. The Masai live in small clusters of huts (called kraals or bomas ) made of sticks sealed together with cow dung; these kraals also include enclosures for the cattle. Masai males are rigidly separated into five age groups: child, junior warrior, senior warrior, junior elder, and senior elder. Both boys and girls undergo circumcision ceremonies, which initiate them into adulthood. Marriages are often arranged, and polygamy is practiced. The Masai believe in a supreme god, Engai, who blesses them with children and cattle.\nPrior to European colonialism of Africa , the Masai herded their cattle freely across the Great Rift Valley of East Africa. They first encountered Europeans in the 1840s. During the 1880s and 1890s, the Masai experienced severe droughts, famine, and disease, including smallpox, which was  due to European contact. The Masai cattle herds were decimated by rinderpest, a highly infectious febrile disease. The weakened Masai fought against the encroachment of the Europeans but were defeated. The Europeans wanted farmland, and acquired large portions of Masai land in the treaties of 1904, 1911, and 1912, which confined the nomadic Masai to reserves and gave the Europeans fertile land. Today the Masai, who number approximately 250,000, live in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. Despite government efforts to settle them, most are still nomadic.\nLanguage: Mursi Mursi (or Murzu)\nPopulation:  6-10,000.\nThe Mursi (or Murzu) are an African nomadic cattle herder ethnicity   located in the Omo valley in southwestern Ethiopia close to the Sudanese border.   The estimated population of the Mursi is around 3900. Surrounded by mountains   and three rivers, the home of the Mursi is one of the most isolated region of   the country. Their neighbors include the Bodi, the Aari, the Banna, the Kara,   the Bumi and the Chai.\nThe Mursi have their own language, also called Mursi. Few   are familiar with Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia , and their literacy   level is very low. The religion of the Mursi ethnicity is classified as Animism,   although about 15% are Christians. The Mursi women are famous of wearing plates   in their lower lips. The reason of this \"ornament\" is for avoiding to be catched   as slaves. These lip discs are made of clay. Girls are pierced in the age of 15   or 16. They remove the plate when eating. Similar body ornaments are worn by the   Suyá people, a Brazilian ethnicity.\nThe Mursi and Bodi live in the valley of the River Omo. They grow crops (mainly   sorghum) using both rain and the retreating floodwaters of the river. They   depend heavily on cattle herding. Men compose songs to their favourite ox or   cow. The Konso number about 200,000 and live in the mountains south of Lake   Chamo. They farm using a system of terraces, on which they grow cotton and other   plants. They weave the cotton into cloth which is exported to other parts of Ethiopia .\nCulture\nThe Mursi are survivors whose isolated   geographic location, combined with the crises of drought, famine, war,   migration, and epidemic diseases has shaped their identity. Cattle raids and   civil instability between bordering ethnic groups is merely a means of survival.   Every aspect of daily life revolves around cattle and crops, which set the   economic standard among the Mursi. When they trade in the market, crops and   cattle are exchanged as money. When a young Mursi girl reaches the age of 15 or   16, her lower lip is pierced so she can wear a lip plate. The larger the lip   plate she can tolerate, the more cattle her bride price will bring for her   father.\nGovernment\nAs one of the most remote people   groups in Ethiopia , the Mursi have remained relatively autonomous from the   Ethiopian government. They alternate between peaceful and hostile relations with   their neighbors, the Bodi and the Banna.The Mursi are in danger of displacement and denial of access to grazing and agricultural land, by African Parks Foundation. It is claimed that the Mursi were coerced into signing documents they could not read by government park officials. In 2005 463 homes were burned down by the Ethiopian Government in Nech Sar National Park Ethiopia after African Parks Foundation signed an agreement with the government.\nRETURN\n \nRelated groups: Ancient Egyptians\nReligion: Islam\nThe \" Nubians \" are those who either presently speak dialects of the Nubian language, or who trace their descent from these people. The Egyptian Nubians are called Kanuz; the northern Sudanese Nubians from the Second Cataract to the Third are called Mahas; and those in the south, in the vicinity of Dongola, Sudan, are called Danagla. Before the spread of Muslim into the Sudan, about the fifteenth century, Nubian-speaking peoples occupied a much larger area, including the land southwards up the Blue Nile. Their descendants live there still, but today they speak only Arabic.\nAncient Nubia , like modern Sudan, was a land of many different peoples who identified themselves primarily by ethnic group and probably spoke many different languages. We now refer to them all as \"Nubians\" but they were not all the same, nor were they unified.\nZulu\nIn Egypt the Nile , by its unobstructed flow from Aswan to the Mediterranean, formed a convenient water highway which at the dawn of history (about 3200 BC) tended to unify the Egyptians by language and culture; this early worked to break down tribal distinctions. In Nubia, however, the Nile had so many treacherous rapids (\"cataracts\") and so many long desolate stretches poorly suited to settled life that the peoples unified into smaller groups. This encouraged the growth of tribes, and, thus, many smaller independent cultures and political units were formed. Only with the emergence of the strong state in the third millennium BC could some of these tribes be brought together by force.\nThe  oversimplified  concept of race ( \"black\" and \"white\" ) is challenged along the Nile Valley, for nowhere is there a  clear transition from one to the other. In America some people use these terms  passionately to identify their own cultural or ethnic allegiances within our  own society.\nIn  the first half of the twentieth century, most European and American scholars  identified the Egyptians as \"white\" and primarily \"Near  Eastern\" in order to remove them from the African cultural sphere and to  serve their ignorant and bigoted views that high civilization could only have  been created by non-Africans. In the latter twentieth century, Afrocentric  scholars indignantly challenged this model, asserting the \"blackness\" and \"African-ness\" of the Egyptians. In each case the aim of these  scholars was to claim \"ownership\" of the Egyptians for their own \"race\" within the context of the modern, primarily American racial  debate. In fact, the Egyptians are certainly Africans, but they are neither \"white\" in the European sense nor \"black\" in the  Congo-African sense. It can be argued that they were like the modern Ethiopians  or Somali people with straight to curly hair and narrow bone structure.\nSo from  a modern racial context they would sit in the African world just as Ethiopians,  Sudanese, Fulani and Somalis do today. The Egyptians really possessed a wide  range of skin color and many differing physical characteristics, as did the  ancient Nubians. But as time progressed an Egypt mixed more with outsiders with  the final influx of modern Arabs the racial texture of Egypt became more  complex with a higher percentage of “white skinned Arabs.” (As seen in lower  Egypt today (North Egypt).\nNorthern Egypt , being linked to Asia, also saw from very early times an influx of  lighter-skinned, non-African peoples, who settled there, intermingled with the  local people or drove them out. From Egyptian history we have clear evidence  that northern Egypt was periodically settled by peoples of non-African origin,  who invaded from the north or east. For example, during the Second Intermediate  period (ca. 1700-1580 BC), all of northern Egypt and much of the eastern  Mediterranean and coastal Palestine (modern Israel) was under the control of  the so-called Hyksos kings. The word \"Hyksos\" comes from an Egyptian  word meaning \"rulers from foreign lands.\" These people were of Near  Eastern origin and maintained their capital Avaris in the Nile Delta. Recent  excavations at Avaris (modern Tell ed-Daba'a), have even revealed remains of a  palace decorated in the style of those on Crete! This has suggested to the  excavator, Dr. Manfred Bietak of the University of Vienna, the strong presence  there of Minoan (Cretan) royalty. This  palace appears to date to the period soon after the Egyptian king Ahmose drove  the Hyksos into Palestine about 1550 BC. It is thought possibly to have belonged  to a Minoan princess sent to marry the Egyptian king. Obviously she and her  servants from Crete would have been very light-skinned. On the other hand,  there were also certainly black-skinned people in the Delta at the same time.  Nubian pottery has been found in one area of Tell ed-Daba'a, which strongly  suggests that Nubian troops were also living there in large numbers. Dark African people were probably also living on Crete and mainland Greece at the  same time, for at Pylos in Greece black-skinned warriors wearing contemporary  Cretan and Mycenaean Greek armor are depicted in the palace frescoes,  suggesting that African troops were being used not only by the Egyptian king  but also by his European counterparts across the sea.\n \nNdebele (Matabele)\nNdebele are a branch of 500 Zulus who split from King Shaka in the early 1820s under the leadership of Mzilikazi, a former general in Shaka's army. They founded a settlement near modern day Bulawayo where the made contact with the Tswana people  who called these Zulus the name \"Matabele\". Tabele comes from tebela which  means 'to chase away' The Ndebele were generally viewed by the Shona  as unwanted raiders.\nThey have a very vibrant art motif which is used in their houses and in their garments.\n \nNuer\nThe Nuer are highly dependent on their environment. They are pre-eminently pastoral, though they grow more millet and maize than is commonly supposed. Some ethnicitys cultivate more and some less, according to conditions of soil and surface water and their wealth in cattle, but all alike regard horticulture as toil forced on them by poverty of stock, for at heart they are herds-men, and the only labour in which they delight is care of cattle.\nThey not only depend on cattle for many of life’s necessities but they have the herdsman’s outlook on the world. Cattle are their dearest possession and they gladly risk their lives to defend their herds or to pillage those of their neighbours. Most of their social activities concern cattle and cherchez la vache is the best advice that can be given to those who desire to understand Nuer behaviour.\nThe attitude of Nuer towards, and their relations with, neighbouring peoples are influenced by their love of cattle and their desire to acquire them. They have profound contempt for peoples with few or no cattle, like the Anuak, while their wars against Dinka ethnicitys have been directed to seizure of cattle and control of pastures. Each Nuer ethnicity and tribal section has its own pastures and water-supplies, and political fission is closely related to distribution of these natural resources, ownership of which is generally expressed in terms of clans and lineages.\nDisputes between sections are very often about cattle, and cattle are the compensation for loss of life and limb that is so frequently their outcome. Leopard-skin chiefs and prophets are arbiters in questions in which cattle are the issue, or ritual agents in situations demanding sacrifice of ox or ram. Another ritual specialist is the wut ghok, the Man of the Cattle. Likewise, in speaking of age-sets and age-grades we find ourselves describing the relations of men to their cattle, for the change from boyhood to manhood is most clearly marked by a corresponding change in those relations at initiation.\nLanguage: Oromiyah (Afaan Oromo): Cushitic linguistic group\nPopulation: 30 million (Ethiopia, Kenya)\nRelated: Sidama, Hadiya, Kambata, Afar, Ogadni\nThe largest Ethnic group in Ethiopia . Traditionally they migrated into modern day Ethiopia and from the South Settled and they started to integrate with their Amharic-speaking neighbors at   least from the 17th century on. They speak an Afro-Asiatic language know as Afan Oromo. Most Oromo live in agricultural settlements, cultivating crops including wheat, barley, and coffee, and farming livestock, although some work in mines as there are gold, silver, and minerals to be found in Oromia. Historically they have  meet with oppression at the hands of the Amhara group.\nMonogamy is generally the rule, but in some areas polygamy is practiced, the number of wives being dependent upon the economic status of the husband. Polygamy is more common among the Muslim Oromo.\nirecha (Ireecha ) Festival:2007\n47,5% are Muslim , 30,5% Orthodox Christians,17,7% Protestants,  but a minority follow the traditional Oromo religion. Reecha is an Oromo ritual which is celebrated at Bishoftu in Debre Zeit, Ethiopia .\nFew Ethiopian traditional   celebrations are as shrouded in mystery and color as Eretcha - the  premier   Oromo cultural celebration that marks the end of the rainy season in the   Ethiopian highlands. A mixture of the Oromo traditional monotheist religion of   Waqaa and in occasions elements of the Ethiopian orthodox church, Ireecha is   celebrated every year towards the end of the month of September. Lake Hora in   Debre Zeit is the most widely respected location of this celebration even though   Eretcha is celebrated through out the country at different   locations. \nThe ritual is performed over a 1 month period where a scared tree is anointed with gifts of food (kebe [butter], rice, etc). Followers and observers of this Oromo religion may also be Muslim and Christian and the religion is viewed as a culture more than a religion.Tradition has it that the Oromo   people of Ethiopia annually give praise to the creator for the most valuable   commodity on the Ethiopian highlands - water .\nPutting grass and green leaves below   the great Oak tree, the traditional coffee ceremony, a warrior ,   beautiful Oromo girls in the Arsi leather outfits, more Oromo girls carrying   Adey Abeba, Lake Hora, young men dancing towards the end of the celebrations,   the great Oak tree that has stood for many many years.\nAmong the most significant of the many Oromo clans are the warlike Tulama group, consisting of about 35 peoples, with traditions of caste and slaveholding, and the Wallo, consisting of about 25 peoples. However, today it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine differences between clans, particularly because of intermarriage.\nSCRIPT\nUntil the 1970s, Afaan Oromo was written with either the  Ge'ez script  or the Latin alphabet Then during the early 1970s, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) chose the Latin alphabet as the official alphabet to write Afaan Oromo. Between 1974 and 1991 under the Mengistu regime the writing of Afaan Oromo in any script was forbidden, though limited usage of the Ge'ez script was allowed. On 3rd November 1991 the OLF convened a meeting of over 1,000 Oromo intellectuals to decide which alphabet to use to write Afaan Ormo. After a many hours of debate, they decided unanimously to adopt the Latin alphabet. How a European script could be used over a related African script speaks to the dangers of so-called liberation when those liberating forces are ignorant of the broader issues.\nUnfortunately many Ormo have stopped using the indigenous African Ge'ez script after 1991 and began formally writing Oromoia in a latin format called called Qubee. Words are subsequently excessively long to accommodate for the inadequacies of latin. It is speculated that the motivation for the change was to create a distinctive cultural identify from the \"semitic\" groups who have historically suppressed their culture.\nThere was a modern script know as the Saphalo   script which was in use around the time of the Italian invasion. Arabic is also common among Muslim communities.\nRELATED: Oromo\nSomalis are a mono-ethnic nomadic people who traded with Arabia and Kemet (Ancient Kingdom of Punt). See Somalia Money and Civil War\nThree great divisions of Somalis exist, roughly corresponding to the northern, central, and southern parts of the region, the Somalis demonstrate considerable cultural unity. The basis of Somali society is the rēr, or large, self-contained kinship group or clan, consisting of a number of families claiming common descent from a male ancestor. A Somali has obligations both to his rēr and to the loosely defined social unit of which his rēr is a part. Government of the rēr is markedly patriarchal, although the chief is chosen by a group of elders who counsel him.\nThe Somalis are primarily nomadic herdsmen who, because of intense competition for scarce resources, have reputation for being aggressive and frequently involved in blood feuds or wars with neighbouring groups and peoples.\nA second category of Somalis are the townspeople and agriculturists of the urban centres, especially along the coast of the Horn of Africa, where intense and prolonged intimacy with the Muslim tradition has rendered the culture highly organized and religiously orthodox and where geographic position has turned the townspeople into commercial middlemen between the Arab wor ld and the nomadic peoples of the interior.\nCULTURE\nSomali people have a rich and distinctive Islamic culture. A favorite pastime is the controversial chewing of chat(khat). Somali women wear very vibrant Muslim shawls and jilbabs. The musical traditions of Somalia are very similar to that of neighboring Ethiopia . Somali people are very passionate about poetry and food.\nLAW\nSomalis for centuries have practiced a form of customary law, which they call Xeer. Xeer is a polycentric l gal system where there is no monopolistic agent that determines what the law should be or how it should be interpreted. A guurti (court) is traditionally formed beneath an acacia tree, where judges arbitrate a dispute until both parties are satisfied. This process can sometimes lead to several days' worth of discussions. The Xeer legal system is assumed to have developed exclusively in the Horn of Africa since approximately the 7th century. There is no evidence that it developed elsewhere or was greatly influenced by any foreign legal system. The fact that Somali legal terminology is practically devoid of loan words from foreign languages suggests that Xeer is truly indigenous\nSHONA (  Karanga )\nRELATED: Lemba , Ndebele\nThe Shona are a cluster of peoples who have lived for about 2,000 years in a region of the southern Africa Plateau. Shona speaking migrants of the late 1800s also live in Zambia, in the Zambezi valley, in Chieftainess Chiawa's area. The Shona are the builders of Great Zimbabwe. Which is the largest stone Structure of pre-colonial Africa south of the equator.\nThe word Zimbabwe literally means \"stone dwelling\" in the Shona language. Thus, Great Zimbabwe is appropriately named because it is indeed a great stone dwelling! The pictures below show parts of the ruins of Great Zimbabwe as they can be seen today by people who visit the country of Zimbabwe.\nThe Torwa State and Munhumutapa states which succeeded the Great Zimbabwe state as well as the Rozvi state which succeeded the Torwa State and with the Mutapa state existed into the 19th century. The states were based on Kingship with certain dynasties being royals.   The Kingdoms were destroyed by new groups moving onto the plateau. The Ndebele destroyed the Rozvi state in the 1830's and the Portuguese slowly eroded the Mutapa State which had extended to the coast of Mozambique. The British destroyed the traditional power in the 1890 and colonised the plateau which the named Rhodesia. In Mozambique the Portuguese colonial government fought the remnants of the Mutapa state until 1902.\n \n \nSAMBURU\nThe Samburu are   related to the Masai although they live just above the equator where the   foothills of Mount Kenya merge into the northern desert and slightly south of   Lake Turkana in the Rift Valley Province of Kenya.\nThey are semi-nomadic pastoralists whose lives revolve around   their cows, sheep, goats, and camels. Milk is their main stay; sometimes it is   mixed with blood. Meat is only eaten on special occasions. Generally they make   soups from roots and barks and eat vegetables if living in an area where they   can be grown.\nMost dress in very traditional clothing of bright red   material used like a skirt and multi-beaded necklaces, bracelets and earrings,   especially when living away from the big cities.\nThe Samburu developed   from one of the later Nilotic migrations from the Sudan, as part of the Plains   Nilotic movement. The broader grouping of the Maa-speaking people continued   moving south, possibly under the pressure of the Borana expansion into their   plains. Maa-speaking peoples have lived and fought from Mt. Elgon to Malindi and   down the Rift Valley into Tanzania. The Samburu are in an early settlement area   of the Maa group.\nThose who moved on south, however (called Maasai),   have retained a more purely nomadic lifestyle until recently when they have also   begun farming. The expanding Turkana ran into the Samburu around 1700 when they   began expanding north and east.\nThe language of the Samburu people is also called Samburu. It is a   Maa language very close to the Maasai dialects. Linguists have debated the   distinction between the Samburu and Maasai languages for decades.\nGenerally between five and ten families set up encampments for five   weeks and then move on to new pastures. Adult men care for the grazing cattle   which are the major source of livelihood. Women are in charge of maintaining the   portable huts, milking cows, obtaining water and gathering firewood. Their   houses are of plastered mud or hides and grass mats stretched over a frame of   poles. A fence of thorns surrounds each family's cattle yard and   huts.\nZulu\nThe name they use for themselves is Lokop or Loikop, a term which   may have a variety of meanings which Samburu themselves do not agree on. Many   assert that it refers to them as \"owners of the land\" (\"lo\" refers to ownership, \"nkop\" is land) though others present a very different interpretation of the   term. The Samburu speak the Samburu language.Their society has for long been so organized around cattle and   warfare (for defense and for raiding others) that they find it hard to change to   a more limited lifestyle. The purported benefits of modern life are often   undesirable to the Samburu. They remain much more traditional in life and   attitude than their Maasai cousins.\nDuties of boys and girls are clearly   delineated. Boys herd cattle and goats and learn to hunt, defending the flocks.   Girls fetch water and wood and cook. Both boys and girls go through an   initiation into adulthood, which involves training in adult responsibilities and   circumcision for boys and clitoridectomy for girls.\nLanguage:  The language of the Samburu people is also called Samburu.   It is a Maa language very close to the Maasai dialects. Linguists have debated   the distinction between the Samburu and Maasai languages for decades. \nIn normal conversation one who speaks one of these languages can understand   the other language 95 percent of the time. But a joint Bible translation was   found to be ineffective to cover both groups. Preferred word usage and some   grammatical difficulties required a separate translation for Samburu and   Maasai. \nThe Samburu tongue is also related to Turkana and Karamojong, and more   distantly to Pokot and the Kalenjin languages.\n \nThe Chamus (Njemps) people   speak the Samburu language and are often counted as Samburu people. They are   reported to be 12% Christian, while the Samburu are considered as 8-9%   Christian. The Ariaal group of Rendille have been greatly affected by the   Samburu and now speak the Samburu language. The Ariaal number 102,000, making a   total of 249,300 mother-tongue speakers of the Samburu language.\nSwahili   is used extensively, particularly among younger people. Swahili is the language   of education and English is taught in schools. There is still a low level of   literacy and education, however, among the Samburu.\nPolitical Situation:  The Samburu have been in a somewhat defensive   position with surrounding peoples moving around them. They have had clashes with   some of the migrating or nomadic peoples. They have maintained a military and   cultural alliance with the Rendille, largely in response to pressures from the   expanding Oromo (Borana) since the 16th century. The Ariaal Rendille have even   adopted the Samburu language. They do not have such an aggressive military   character as the Maasai proper.\nThey were associated with the Laikipiak   (Oloikop) Maasai, also called Kwavi, who followed a lifestyle with light   agriculture. They have added camels to their culture, further differentiating   them from the Maasai. In recent decades, they have had mostly peaceful relations   with their neighbors, who include Maasai, Somali, Borana, Turkana and Gabbra as   well as Rendille.\nThe Samburu got separated from the other Maa speakers   due to the migration of Maasai farther south and of other ethnic various groups   around them. The Samburu have been somewhat outside the stream of national   politics also. They have had less development than some others in Kenya. \nChange is beginning to occur as group ranching schemes have developed and   education has become available. Many Samburu warriors enlisted in the British   forces during World War II. Likewise Samburu serve in the Kenya armed forces and   police.\nCustoms:  Generally between five and ten families set up encampments   for five weeks and then move on to new pastures. Adult men care for the grazing   cattle which are the major source of livelihood. Women are in charge of   maintaining the portable huts, milking cows, obtaining water and gathering   firewood. Their houses are of plastered mud or hides and grass mats stretched   over a frame of poles. A fence of thorns surrounds each family's cattle yard and   huts.\nMarriage is a unique series of elaborate ritual. Great importance   is given to the preparation of gifts by the bridegroom (two goatskins, two   copper earrings, a container for milk, a sheep) and of gifts for the ceremony.   The marriage is concluded when a bull enters a hut guarded by the bride's   mother, and is killed. \nFertility is a very high value for the Samburu. A   childless woman will be ridiculed, even by children. Samburu boys may throw cow   dung against the hut of a woman thought to be sterile. A fertility ritual   involves placing a mud figure in front of the woman's house. One week later, a   feast will be given in which the husband invites neighbors to eat a slaughtered   bull with him. As a little fat is spread over the woman's belly, they will say: \"May God give you a child!\"\nTheir society has for long been so organized   around cattle and warfare (for defense and for raiding others) that they find it   hard to change to a more limited lifestyle. The purported benefits of modern   life are often undesirable to the Samburu. They remain much more traditional in   life and attitude than their Maasai cousins.\nDuties of boys and girls are   clearly delineated. Boys herd cattle and goats and learn to hunt, defending the   flocks. Girls fetch water and wood and cook. Both boys and girls go through an   initiation into adulthood, which involves training in adult responsibilities and   circumcision for boys and clitoridectomy for girls. \nInitiation is done   in age grades of about five years, with the new \"class\" of boys becoming   warriors, or morans. (il-murran). The moran status involves two stages, junior   and senior. After serving five years as junior morans, the group go through a   naming ceremony, becoming senior morans for six years. After these eleven years,   the senior moran are free to marry and join the married men (junior   elders).\nSamburu are very independent and egalitarian. Community   decisions are normally made by men (senior elders or both senior and junior   elders but not morani), often under a tree designated as a \"council\" meeting   site. Women may sit in an outer circle and usually will not speak directly in   the open council, but may convey a comment or concern through a male relative.   However, women may have their own \"council\" discussions and then carry the   results of such discussions to men for consideration in the men's   council.\nThe Samburu love to sing and dance, but traditionally used no   instruments, even drums. They have dances for various occasions of life. The men   dance jumping, and high jumping from a standing position is a great sport. Most   dances involve the men and women dancing in their separate circles with   particular moves for each sex, but coordinating the movements of the two groups.\nReligion: The Samburu traditional religion is based on acknowledgment of the Creator God, whom they   call Nkai, as do other Maa-speaking peoples. They think of him as living in the   mountains around their land, such as Mount Marsabit. \n \nNARRATIVE PROFILE\nLocation:\nThe Tigrinya (ti-GRIN-yuh) or   Tigray (ti-GRAH-ee) people live in the southern highlands of Eritrea and the   northern highlands of Ethiopia´s Tigray province. They also live in Ethiopia´s   Gonder and Welo provinces. There are about 2 million in Eritrea and about 4   million in Ethiopia.\nThe term Tigray is used in Ethiopia for both the people and their province.   Tigrinya is used in Eritrea for the same people, so-called from the language   they speak. Differences in terminology and spelling have led to a different   political identity of this people group on each side of the border dividing the   group. Culturally they are one people group. The terms Tigray, Tigrinya or   Tigray-Tigrinya apply to the total people group, unless otherwise indicated.\nHistory:\nThe history of the two   countries--Ethiopia and Eritrea--is closely linked, although beginning in the   late 1800s, Eritrea was colonized by Italy. Eritrea was an Italian colony until   1941, then the British controlled it until 1951. Following the British   occupation, the United Nations made it a federated autonomous territory with Ethiopia , until Ethiopia decided to annex it as a province in 1962.\nThe Tigray-Tigrinya (also referred to as Tigrean) people are descendants of   early Semitic peoples who originally settled in the Horn of Africa about 1000   BC. It seems they are related to or descended from the Sabaean (Sheban) people.   According to their traditions they trace their roots to Menelik I, the child   born of the queen of Sheba and King Solomon. It is thought that the Sabaean   (Sheban) people began to settle on the west coast of the Red Sea, from their   home in southern Arabia, about 1000 BC.\nMenelik I was the first of the Solomonic line of rulers of Ethiopia that   ended only with the deposing of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974. By about 1500 BC   their civilization became the Aksum  Empire, based on a mixture of the early   Sabaean culture and the prior Cushitic culture. The ruins of the ancient city of   Aksum  can still be seen in Tigray Province. Except for a few notable exceptions,   the Amhara have been the dominant people group in Ethiopia history. The strength   of their culture is shown in this influence though they number only 15 million   of the estimated 53 million population of modern Ethiopia .\nThe Sabaeans are referred to in the Quran along with Christians and Jews as \"People of the Book.\" The Tigray-Tigrinya were associated with the Amhara in the   ancient kingdom of Abyssinia, called in the Tigrinya language Etiopia, the   source of the modern name of Ethiopia . The area where they live in the mountains   was the center of the ancient Cushite empire of Aksum . The name Abyssinia comes   from an early name--Habash--of an early group of the Sabaean settlers who became   the Tigrinya.\nIdentity:\nLike the rest of Ethiopia ,   the majority of the Tigray people are subsistence farmers. They are generally   considered very beautiful people. Among Ethiopians, they are some of the most   industrious and determined people. During the 1985 famine, when Ethiopia filled   the American news and volunteers from Live Aid and Southern Baptist missionaries   were feeding millions of people, it was a film about famine-stricken Tigray that   raised international consciousness. Tigray received almost no aid. The   government was trying to break the will of the independent Tigray, so they kept   aid workers out of the region.\nTUAREG (Kel Tamahaq - Kel Tamasheq - Kel Ajjer)\nLOCATION: Saharan and Sahelian Africa (mostly Niger, Mali, Algeria,   Libya, and Burkina Faso)\nEthnologue Code: TTQ, THZ, THV\nOther Names: Imjeghen, Blue men of the desert.\nDialects: 4, each with sub-dialects\nPopulation\nTotal People: approx. 1.25 million (Algeria 76,000; Mali 100,000; Libya 18,000; Niger 700,000; refugees in Mauritania and Burkina Faso).\nLANGUAGE: Tamacheq. They have an ancient written script known as    tifinagh\nThe Tuareg or \"Blue Men of the Desert\" have long been known as warriors, traders and travellers of the Sahara Desert - as a people of grace and nobility as well as fighters of fierce reputation. Timbuctoo had previously been sacked by the Tuaregs as early a 1433, and they had occupied it for thirty years. Between 1591 and 1593, the Tuaregs had already taken advantage of the situation to plunder Timbuctoo once more. Between 1723 and 1728, the Tuaregs once more occupied and looted Timbuctoo. Thus Timbuctoo, once the queen city of the Western Sudan, with more than 200,000 inhabitants, and the center of a powerful state, degenerated into a shadow of its former stature.\nHISTORY: Tuareg is a term used to identify numerous diverse groups of people who share a   common language and a common history. Tuareg camel caravans played the primary   role in trans-Saharan trade until the mid-20th century when European trains and   trucks took over. Goods that once were brought north to the edge of the Sahara   are now taken to the coast by train and then shipped to Europe and beyond.   Tuareg history begins in northern Africa where their presence was recorded by   Herodotus. Many groups have slowly moved southward over the last 2,000 years in   response to pressures from the north and the promise of a more prosperous land   in the south. Today, many Tuareg live in sedentary communities in the cities   bordering the Sahara that once were the great centers of trade for western   Africa.  Tuareg an Islam le who perform their 5 daily prays.\nTuareg is a term given to these people by the Arabs, as they initially resisted Islam . The name Tuareg means \"abandoned by God\".  Individually the ethnicitys are recognised by area of origin or language:  Kel Tamasheq (meaning the people who speak Tamasheq), Kel Tamashek, Kel Ajjer, Kel Tamahaq and there are other dialects and names they call themselves.\nECONOMY: For thousands of years, Tuareg economy revolved around trans-Saharan trade.   There are basically five trade routes which extend across the Sahara from the   northern Mediterranean coast of Africa to the great cities on the southern edge   of the Sahara. Tuareg merchants were responsible for bringing goods from these   cities to the north. From there they were distributed throughout the world.   Because of the nature of transport and the limited space available in caravans,   Tuareg usually traded in luxury items, things which took up little space and on   which a large profit could be made. Tuareg were also responsible for bringing   enslaved people north from west Africa to be sold to Europeans and Middle   Easterners. Many Tuareg settled into the communities with which they traded,   serving as local merchants and representatives for their friends and family who   continued to trade.\nEconomics\nOccupations: Pastoralists, guards, domestic servants, blacksmiths\nIncome sources: Cheese, livestock, transport of salt, dates\nProducts/Crafts: Cheese, baskets, mats, leatherwork, knives, iron objects, jewelry\nTrade partners: Neighbouring peoples, Algeria, Mali, Nigeria. There is a mutual economic dependency of nomads and farmers, and a rivalry over administration of production means.\nModernisation/Utilities: Many people were forced to give up their nomadic lifestyle and moved to the towns. Some villiages, also in remote areas, have one TV set with a solar panel (although maintainance is a problem).\nHistorically, Tuareg society was divided between those who tended the land and   those who did not. At one time, tilling the land was considered the work of the   lower classes, while the upper classes reaped the benefits of trading. Usually   groups of sedentary Tuareg would pay allegience to a locally appointed headman,   who in turn would report to the noble who considered the village his domain.Historically, Tuareg society was divided between those who tended the land and   those who did not. At one time, tilling the land was considered the work of the   lower classes, while the upper classes reaped the benefits of trading.\nTIGRE\nRELIGION: Muslim\nLanguages: Tigre\nThe Tigre are a predominantly Muslim nomadic people who inhabit the northern, western, and coastal lowlands of Eritrea, as well as areas in eastern Sudan. 99.5% of the Tigre people adhere to the Islamic religion Sunni Islam, but there are a considerable amount of Christians among them as well (often referred to as the Mensaï in Eritrea)\nSome Tigre are settled farmers, growing crops of corn, sorghum, wheat, barley, legumes, and linseed. They also raise goats and sometimes cattle. They live in villages, and their homes are round and have cone-shaped roofs made of branches and leaves.\nThe Tigre language  uses the Ge'ez syllabary. However, due to the majority of Tigre speakers being Muslim also use the Arabic alphabet. However, the Ge'ez syllabary is also not ideal to transcribe Tigre as it does not portray vowel length, which is an important factor in the Tigre language\nTUTSI\nRELIGION: Christian and Muslim (post genocide)\nLanguages: Kirundi, Kinyarwanda, French\nTutsi - The name of   the ethnic group. Watutsi - One Tutsi (Wa means 'one' also in Ancient   Egyptian.) Mututsi - Means the same as Watutsi. Batutsi - Means the Tutsi people as a whole.   (Bah means 'men, people' in Ancient Egyptian.) Watusi - A breed of cattle.\nISLAM AND TUTSI\nRwandan Muslim s converted in large numbers after the 1994 Genocide. One reason for this shift is that many Muslim s had sheltered refugees - both Hutu and Tutsi - in Muslim homes, villages and suburbs. Many converts converted to Islam because of the role that some Catholic and Protestant leaders played in the genocide. Human rights groups have documented several incidents in which Christian clerics permitted Tutsis to seek refuge in churches, then surrendered them to Hutu death squads. Instances of Hutu priests and ministers encouraging their congregations to kill Tutsis have also been documented. Some Tutsi converted have converted for safety, as they feared continuing reprisal killings by Hutu extremists, and knowing that Muslim s would protect them from such acts. Many Hutu converted as well, in search for \"purification.\" Many Hutus want to leave their violent past behind them and to not have \"blood on their hands.\" There are also a few, isolated instances, where Hutus have converted in the hope that they could hide within the Muslim community and thereby escape arrest. The rate of conversions slowed down in 1997. According to the mufti of Rwanda, the Islamic community has not seen any increases in conversions in 2002-3.[8] Christianity remains as the country's leading religion. Catholicism (it arrived in the late 19th century with the White Fathers order of the Roman Catholic Church) is still deeply embedded in the culture. According to Rwandan Muslim leaders, Muslims make up 14 percent of the 8.2 million people in Rwanda, Africa's most Catholic nation, twice as many as before the killings began.\nThe Tutsi of Rwanda first came into contact with the West at the end of the 19th century. Rwandan society was highly stratified. It was divided into the Tutsi, the ruling class who raised cattle, the Hutu who were farmers and the Twa who were hunters. Western discourses about the Tutsi emphasized race and social hierarchy. Based on their physical characteristics--they are among the tallest people in Africa--and their aristocratic demeanor, the Tutsi were assumed by early 20th-century Westerners to be the most \"advanced\" African peoples in the now-denounced evolutionary scheme promulgated at the time. Their appearance and elaborate court rituals made them perfect photographic subjects. The kings soon played into the wishes of photographers by staging for them the famous Ntore dances of young warriors. Pictures of these dances became signature images of Rwanda. Casimir Zagourski seems to have visited Rwanda twice and photographed King Yuhi V. Musinga--who ruled from 1897 until he was deposed by the Belgians in 1931--his son and successor Mutara III Rudahigwa (ruled 1931-1959) and Rudahigwa's mother. After the Second World War, Nyanza, the capital of the kingdom, became a stop on the tourist route through the region and was flooded by photographers and film makers, including the professionals of Inforcongo and Congopresse.\nW\nWodaabe\nWodaabe peoples are   acutually a subgroup of the larger Fulbe-speaking Fulani. They are know for their striking beauty and vanity. They prefer to call   themselves Bororo. Fulani are a nomadic people who have been influential in   regional politics, economics, and histories throughout western Africa for over a   thousand years. Wodaabe live in northern Nigeria and played a significant role   in furthering Fulani domination in the area. The height of the Fulani empire was   between the early 1800s and early 1900s. This power was consolidated under Usman   dan Fodio and was centered in northern Nigeria. Dan Fodio was a devout Muslim who used religious fervor to ignite his troops to undertake a series of holy   wars. Following the early success of Muslim warriors, non-Islamic Fulani joined   ranks with their fellows to form an extensive and powerful empire.\nEconomy:Wodaabe are mainly nomadic herders   and traders. The routes they established in western Africa provided extensive   links throughout the region that fostered economic and political ties between   otherwise isolated ethnic groups. Dairy products produced from cattle were   traded to sedentary farmers for agricultural products and luxury items. These   items could then be traded to trans-Saharan traders such as the Tuareg for   shipment north. Fine woven cloth produced by the Wodaabe was considered a luxury   item that could be traded on the international market.\nPolitical Systems:The two most significant   factors in Fulani political systems are clientage and competition. In order to   gain political office a Fulani man would have to compete among his fellows for   the right to rule. He could show his political favor by demonstrating that he   had a large following in the form of individuals and families. By agreeing to   become the client of a powerful man or family, a subject would offer tribute in   the form of gifts and political support in exchange for security. Wodaabe men   often held considerable political power within their own nomadic communities, as   well as within the communities in which they settled in northern Nigeria.\nReligion: Wodaabe religion is   largely Muslim . Although there are varying degrees of orthodoxy exhibited, most   adhere to at least some of the basic requirements of the religion. It is usually   the case that the wealthy and powerful are among the most religious, while those   who have fewer resources are less likely to strictly observe their religion. Muslim has been used   to justify the holy jihads that brought the northern territories of modern day   Nigeria under the auspices of Wodaabe and Fulani leadership.\nHistorically, it   has not been unusual that such political and economic gains would be made in the   name of Muslim and result in empire building. Muslim became a religion of   importance among Wodaabe peoples during the 16th century when the great prophet   El Maghili preached the teachings of Mohammed to the elite of northern Nigeria.   El Maghili was responsible for converting the ruling classes among Hausa,   Fulani, and Tuareg peoples in the region.\nWOLOF\nRELIGION: Islam\nLanguages: Wolof & (French, Arabic)\nWolof (Wollof)  people are a dominant cultural group of Senegal and Gambia. In Gambia even the dominant Mandinka people speak Wolof.\nThe Wolof Empire (jolof Empire) was a medieval West African state that ruled parts of Senegal and The Gambia from approximately 1350 to 1890. While only ever consolidated into a single state structure for part of this time, the tradion of governance, caste, and culture of the Wolof dominate the history of north-central Senegal for much of the last 800 years. Its final demise at the hands of French colonial forces in the 1870s-1890s also marks the beginning of the formation of Senegal as a unified state.\nRELIGION\nIslam entered into West Africa via Fulani and other traders. It then spread into the Wolof communities.\nThe Senegalese Sufi Muslim brotherhoods, appearing in Wolof communities in the 19th century, grew tremendously in the 20th. Their leaders, or marabouts, exercise a huge cultural and political influence amongst most Muslim communities, most notably the leader of the Mouride brotherhood, Serigne Mouhamadou Lamine Bara Mbacke. The largest religious festival in Wolof culture is Tabaski {Tobaski }( Muslim Eid ul Adha).\nCULTURE\nCulturally, clothing is very important to the Wolof, who are a style conscious society. To a Wolof what you wear says a tremendous amount about you. Women will dress elaborately, many times going into debt just to be dressed up to an occasion. They also wear elaborate hair styles and makeup. The Wolof are known as the trend-setters of West Africa. The family unit is very important to the Wolof. Many times a man and all his brothers and their wives and children will live together in a single compound. Many Wolof are also polygamous, however, polygamy doesn't seem to be considered natural to many of the Wolof who soon after obtaining a second wife are divorced from their first.\nMARRIAGE\nLOCATION: South Africa (Eastern Cape)\nRELIGION: Christian and Indigenous African faith\nLanguages: Xhosa, Zulu (Xhosa is an agglutinative tonal language of the Bantu family it has charecteristic CLICKS)\nXhosa people are part of the Nguni group (See Zulu ). During the Bantu Exapnsion the migrated South into Southern Africa. Xhosa and Zulu language is mutually intellgible. It is claimed that Xhosa language has more chareteristic \"clicks\" which were taken from the Khoisan language.\nAt the time of white settlement of the Cape, Xhosa groups were living far inland, into the area between Bushman's River and the Kei River. Since around 1770, they had been confronted with the Trek Boers who approached from the west. Both the Boers and the Xhosa were stock-farmers. The competition for grazing land led first to quarrels between the two groups, and eventually it came to a number of wars. The politics of the colonial government attempted to enforce the separation . But the more the colony developed into a modern state with a strong military organization, the more the whites tended towards a policy of land annexing and the subjugation of the African population.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, all the land formerly inhabited by Xhosa was in the hands of white settlers. With the founding of the South African Union in 1910, the British colony and the independent Boer Republics were united. A modern \"democratic\" state was formed. in which only the white population could execute the right to vote.\nCULTURE\nThe Xhosas have a strong oral tradition with many stories of ancestral heroes; according to tradition, the leader from whose name the Xhosa people take their name was the first human on Earth. Other traditions have it that all Xhosas are descended from one ancestor named Tshawe. The key figure in the Xhosa oral tradition is the imbongi or praise singer. Rites of passage is key to manhood in Xhosa culture which generally include male circumcision, female FCM is not practiced.\nY\nYORUBA\nYoruba (people), people   living primarily in southwest Nigeria and eastern Benin who speak Yoruba, a   Niger-Congo language. The Yoruba are predominantly town dwellers who practice   hoe agriculture and are well known as traders and for their crafts. Yoruba   artists have produced masterpieces of woodcarving and bronze casting, some of   which date from as early as the 13th century. The Yoruba religion is animistic   and numerous gods are worshiped.\n \nBy the 17th century the Yoruba had succeeded in   establishing a strong and flourishing state, the kingdom of Oyo, in the region   between Dahomey and the Niger River. Oyo disintegrated into numerous petty   kingdoms during the first half of the 19th century. Toward the end of the 19th   century the Yoruba came under British control. They now number about 27 million   and make up one-fifth of the population of Nigeria, living chiefly in the city   of Ibadan. Many of Nigeria's best-known artists and writers are Yoruba.\n \nZAGHAWA\nThe   Zaghawa are scattered throughout the African countries of Sudan, Chad and Niger.   Also called the Beri, the Sudanese Zaghawa are a    semi-nomadic Ethnicity that is found living primarily along the border between Sudan   and Chad. Numbering approximately 171,000, they are a camel and cattle herding   group who also engage in a fair amount of agriculture. \nThe   Zaghawa are an ancient society that dates back to the seventh century. During   that time, they had their own kingdom ruled by   chieftans and divided into strict social classes   and family clans. The various clusters of Zaghawa tribes are still divided into clans, yet the development of the nations of   Sudan, Chad and Niger has weakened the chiefs and the overall Zaghawa social   system. \nThe   problem of water is a major preoccupation for the Zaghawa, who during normal   years must wait nine dry months for a short rainy season which lasts between the   end of June and the end of August. To survive, many herdsmen drive their animals   north to graze during the dry season, and return south when it rains. \nIn   addition to using the milk of their cattle, sheep and camels and selling some   animals for income, the Zaghawa also grow vegetables such as tomatoes, onions   and okra in small gardens surrounding their homes   and raise crops such as millet and tubers (starchy root vegetables). Many   Zaghawa are merchants who travel southward and eastward to find food and manufactured goods that are not available in their own region. Sugar, tea, oil, blankets,   plastic products  and soap are all purchased or exchanged for cattle, sheep,   wild grasses and the gum of the acacia tree. Some men also work as blacksmiths,   although craftsmen would be a better collective name for these artists who make   metal tools, weapons and jewelry; create pottery; carve wooden stools and   musical instruments; weave cotton; and tan hides to make various leather   items.\nThe adoption of Muslim , which was introduced into the region in the 1600s. Villages have become   hospitable to outsiders, and sacrifice and ancestor worship have either been    modified and reinterpreted in order to be acceptable to Muslim .   Although Muslim is widely accepted and the study of Muslim law is highly   respected, the Zaghawa, like Muslims everywhere, still hang on to many of their traditional superstitions.   To avoid the curse of the “evil eye,” a rather vague yet terrifying phenomenon,   they wear charms, construct their houses in a certain fashion and cover their   babies’ faces in public.\n \nRELIGION: Christian and Indigenous African faith\nLanguages:  Zulu (Zulu is an agglutinative tonal language of the Bantu family it has charecteristic CLICKS)\nZulu means \"People of the sky/heaven\"\nThe Zulu were originally a major clan in what is today Northern KwaZulu-Natal, founded ca. 1709 by Zulu kaNtombhela. So the Zulu nation is an 18th century amalgamation of different clans into the Zulu clan identity. In the Nguni languages, iZulu/iliZulu/liTulu means heaven. The Zulu are the largest ethnic group in South Africa . They are well known for   their beautiful brightly colored beads and baskets as well as other small   carvings. Historical they are know for defeating the British Army at Isandlwana (remaining the single greatest British military defeat at the hands of a native   force in history). However Zulu history, as Molefi Asante said, is the history of blood flow.\nThe Zulu believe that they are descendents from a chief from the   Congo area, and in the 16th century migrated south picking up many of the   traditions and customs of the San who also inhabited this South African area.   During the 17th and 18th centuries many of the most powerful chiefs made   treaties and gave control of the Zulu villages to the British.\nZulu\nThe Zulu believe that they are descendents from a chief from the   Congo area, and in the 16th century migrated south picking up many of the   traditions and customs of the San who also inhabited this South African area.   During the 17th and 18th centuries many of the most powerful chiefs made   treaties and gave control of the Zulu villages to the British.\nThis caused much   conflict because the Zulu had strong patriarchal village government systems so   they fought against the British but couldn't win because of the small strength   they possessed. Finally, after much of the Zulu area had been given to the   British the Zulu people decided as a whole that they didn't want to be under   British rule and in 1879 war erupted between the British and the Zulu. Though   the Zulu succeeded at first they were in 6 months conquered by the British who   exiled the Zulu Kings and divided up the Zulu kingdom. In 1906 another Zulu   uprising was lead and the Zulu continue to try to gain back what they consider   to be their ancient kingdom.\nThe AmaZulu believe that they are the direct descendants of the patriarch   Zulu, who was born to a Nguni chief in the Congo Basin area. In the 16th century   the Zulu migrated southward to their present location, incorporating many of the   customs of the San, including the well-known linguistic clicking sounds of the   region. During the reign of King Shaka (1816-1828), the Zulu became the   mightiest military force in southern Africa, increasing their land holdings from   100 square miles to 11,500. Shaka was followed by Dingaan, who tentatively   entered into treaties with English colonizers. Mpande was the next King. He   allowed the British extensive control over his peoples. By the time he died in   1872, the Zulu had had enough of the English invasion. Cetewayo, Mpande's   replacement, tried vainly for six years to avoid a confrontation with the   British, yet in 1879 war erupted. Although the Zulu initially experienced some   success, the British army eventually prevailed.\nIn less than six months,   Cetewayo was exiled to England, and the Zulu kingdom was divided to the British   advantage. The last Zulu uprising against European domination was lead by Chief   Bombatha in 1906. In recent times, Chief Gastha Buthelezi has doubled as the   political leader of the Zulu, and the head of the Inkatha Freedom Party, leading   the fight against Apartheid and the ANC, demanding a voice for his people who   are more than three million strong.\nRELIGION: The Zulu believe in a creator god known as Nkulunkulu, but this god does not   interact with humans and has no interest in everyday life. Therefore, most Zulus   interact on a day to day level with the spirits. In order to interact with the   spirits the Zulu must use divination to interact with the ancestors. All   misfortune is a result of a evil sorcery or offended spirits, nothing just   happens because of natural causes. Zulu people perform ceremonial sacrifice of animals in a similar way to Muslim and Jews .\nThe Zulu are practically divided in   half with about 50% living in cities and engaging in domestic work and another   50% working on farms.\nEconomy\nRural Zulu raise cattle and farm corn and vegetables for subsistence   purposes. The men and herd boys are primarily responsible for the cows, which   are grazed in the open country, while the women do most, if not all, of the   planting and harvesting. The women also are the owners of the family house and   have considerable economic clout within the family. In the urban areas of South   Africa, Zulu, and in fact all Africans, are limited to labor intensive work and   domestic duties. Even as Apartheid as an institution has been dismantled, it is   still extremely difficult for Africans to compete for jobs for which they have   not been trained, and the country is still entrenched in de facto   racism.\nNEW OPPRESSION and EXPLOITATION\nWithin Townships such as KwaMashu in Durban economic issues still exist in post-apartheid South Africa due to inner corruption. A recent case study on a charity K-CAP run by Edmund Mhlongo found that gross mismanagement, poor leadership and injustices via exploiting poverty These issues are generally swept under the carpet for fear of embarrassment and no confidence on the part of the funders. So in the new South Africa the inner oppression is rising while the facade promotes a racial equally society. However the economic growth is within a tiny minority of Africans who in the case of Edmund Mhlongo (just one example) do so at the expense of the majority.\n \nPolitical Systems\nAs is evident by the history of the Zulu, the leader, or chief, is invested   with power based on his genealogy. He plays an important part in the internal   governing of the Zulu homeland and also acts as a voice for his people on an   international level. Although the Zulu are officially ruled by the government of   South Africa, they often act as a dissenting voice on the national scene..",
                "Horn of Africa could become major front for anti-terrorism efforts - USATODAY.com\nHorn of Africa could become major front for anti-terrorism efforts\nPosted 10/21/2006 12:13 PM ET\nE-mail | Print |\nBy Chris Tomlinson, Associated Press\nNAIROBI, Kenya  From the Red Sea to Lake Victoria, the Horn of Africa is one of the few places in the world where, if careful, a traveler can move 1,400 miles across four countries without producing a passport or encountering a single government official.\nThese footpaths, back roads and rivers have been used for centuries by merchants and slave traders, explorers, smugglers and bandits. Rebels easily sneak around the central governments in the big cities.\nSo could any traveler. Even a terrorist.\nCorrupt governments, porous borders, widespread poverty and discontented Muslim populations have created a region ripe for Islamic fundamentalism. The Horn of Africa, home to about 165 million people, is roughly half the area of the United States.\nThe six countries that make up the Horn — Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya and Djibouti — could become the next major front in the war on terrorism. Kenyan police earlier this year caught a smuggler trying to bring in an anti-aircraft missile.\nKenya, and Tanzania just to its south, have already been victims of al-Qaeda terrorism, with the bombings at the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998 and attacks on a hotel and an Israeli airliner in Kenya in 2002. The attacks emanated from neighboring Somalia, which has had no effective central government since 1992 and has a growing Islamic fundamentalist movement.\nWestern and regional diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, said they believe another terrorist attack could be imminent.\nRobert Rotberg, director of Harvard University's Program on Intrastate Conflict and Conflict Resolution, said every country in the region is at risk because radicals see an opportunity to take advantage of weak, unpopular governments.\n\"Governance and the standard of living are so low in that part of Africa,\" Rotberg said. \"There is certainly a possibility of meddling in troubled waters.\"\nEthnic Somalis are the common denominator in the Horn of Africa, and their large presence in neighboring countries has long been a source of conflict. In the mid-1970s, then Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre advocated expanding the country's borders to unite all Somali-speaking people in Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti.\nDespite a disastrous and short-lived invasion of Ethiopia in 1977 and political anarchy since 1992, Somali nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists still advocate this Greater Somalia. An ethnic-Somali insurgency continues in eastern Ethiopia, led by the Ogaden Liberation Front, a small group that mostly uses pipe bombs or small-scale attacks to advance their cause.\nGovernments in the Horn of Africa have watched with concern as the Somali Transitional Federal Government they helped create in 2004 after two years of peace talks has been eclipsed by the Islamic Courts Union, led by an elderly cleric, Sheik Hassan Dahir Aweys, who is committed to a nationalist, Islamic regime and allegedly has ties to Ethiopian rebel groups.\n\"The comfort zone is to look at Somalia as being far away and hope that the problem will resolve itself somehow,\" Kenya's Minister for Foreign Affairs Raphael Tuju recently told the U.N. General Assembly. But a Somalia with no government in place \"is a danger not just to neighboring countries but to the whole world.\"\nEthiopia, Africa's second most populous country, has sent troops to the Somali town of Baidoa to prop up the official government, which is also backed by the United Nations. Despite the support, though, Baidoa is the only part of the country the government controls.\nThe African Union, a continentwide diplomatic bloc, has also authorized the deployment of 8,000 Ugandan and Sudanese peacekeepers to protect the government and stabilize Somalia. But with Aweys and other Islamic leaders vehemently opposed, and no rich country ready to pay the bills, the mission has not moved beyond the planning stage.\nThe Islamic militants' sudden ascendancy and popularity have shaken the region, and the ripples have reached the United States and Europe. The United States urgently formed the International Contact Group for Somalia in July to deal with the sudden rise of Islamic militancy and to politically support the government.\nMario Raffaelli, Italy's special envoy to the former Italian colony, said he believes the struggle between the transitional government and the Islamic Courts Union for control of Somalia could ignite a regional war, drawing in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya and possibly even Sudan.\n\"The change in Mogadishu has changed the whole regional picture,\" he said. \"And made it much more dangerous.\"\nU.S. Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer has accused Aweys of sheltering al-Qaeda suspects believed to be responsible for the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. diplomats also fear al-Qaeda operatives will persuade Aweys to turn Somalia into a haven for international terrorists.\n\"Somalia has been a collapsed state since 1991,\" said Rotberg, an expert on the Horn. \"It obviously opens up some territory for al-Qaeda to meddle.\"\nBut Aweys has rejected comparisons with Afghanistan's Taliban regime in the late 1990s, which sheltered Osama bin Laden while he planned the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. He has repeatedly said he has no contacts with al-Qaeda and is interested only in bringing peace and prosperity to his country.\nResidents of Mogadishu, though, have felt the Courts Union's hard-line Islamic law which is reminiscent of Afghanistan. It has started public flogging of convicted felons and publicly executed a convicted murderer by firing squad on Sept. 22.\nFatima Mohamud, a 34-year-old housewife, said she welcomed the peace the Islamic militias have brought to the capital, but as a follower of Somalia's moderate Sufi form of Islam, she is not comfortable with the Courts Union's fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law.\n\"They closed the video halls where the children would watch soccer matches,\" she said. \"Now three of my boys can hardly go out because they have nowhere to go for entertainment, and they can't dress the way they want; they're told to cut their hair and shorten their trousers.\"\n\"I don't know where Islam restricts all these innocent activities,\" she added.\nLeaders of neighboring countries fear that if an Islamic regime is successful in Somalia, fundamentalist clerics in other parts of the Horn will emulate them. The United States has decided to take a soft-sell approach to convincing the millions of Muslims in the region not to join the radicals and instead embrace democracy.\nAt the strategic point where the Red Sea opens into the Indian Ocean, a territory once known as French Somalia became the independent and stable country of Djibouti in 1977. The nation of 486,000 people has close ties to the West and hosts the French Foreign Legion's 13th Demi-brigade and a U.S. counterterrorism force known as the Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa.\nThe task force, set up in June 2002 at a former Legion outpost, is responsible for fighting terrorism in the Horn of Africa as well as Yemen, Tanzania and Uganda. The 1,600 troops assigned to Djibouti use military training, humanitarian aid and intelligence operations to keep nations in the region from becoming terrorist havens.\nOfficials say they have military liaisons in all the countries except Somalia and Eritrea and carry out humanitarian missions on a regular basis. U.S. troops have also helped train border forces in Djibouti and Ethiopia as well as maritime forces in Kenya to build up those countries' ability to protect their borders with Somalia.\n\"We feel the best way to counter terrorism is to go after conditions that foster terrorism,\" U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Richard W. Hunt, the task force commander, said during an operation to refurbish a clinic in Tanzania. \"So we focus on medical care, education. We attack these causes right at the very root.\"\nHe added that the task force wants to build conditions that never let a terrorist ideology take hold. \"The terrorists will go after any area they think they can exploit,\" Hunt said.\nThe Horn of Africa needs more than military solutions, agreed Caty Clement, a regional director for the International Crisis Group, a conflict prevention center.\n\"It does matter to be able to control your borders, to be able to police the population,\" Clement said. \"But it's only one aspect of the problem.\"\nWhether a nation becomes a failed state has a lot to do with poverty, official corruption, international aid and middle-class support for the government, she said. Creating strong legislatures, independent courts and healthy economies goes beyond the capabilities of the military, Clement added.\nThose tasks may also be beyond the capabilities of the Islamic fundamentalists. Just three months after taking power, Somalia's Islamic Courts Union has not produced the prosperity and political freedom the people of Mogadishu expected.\n\"Residents here want to see something different and better than the present stability,\" said Mohamed Hussein, an economist who has contacts among the Islamic leaders. \"People want new political thinking and political pluralism.\"\nThe regional leaders, Western diplomats and U.S. troops in the Horn of Africa can only hope that he's right — and that all of the people of the Horn of Africa also want the same.\nCopyright 2006 The Associated Press.

                "The European Union (EU) is a politico-economic union of  member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of  , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade,  agriculture,  fisheries, and regional development.  Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished.  A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.\n\nThe EU operates through a hybrid system of supranational and intergovernmental decision-making.   The seven principal decision-making bodies—known as the institutions of the European Union—are the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the European Court of Auditors.\n\nThe EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by the Inner Six countries in 1951 and 1958, respectively. The community and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. While no member state has, as yet, ever left the EU, a non-binding referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016 supported leaving. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union in 1993 and introduced European citizenship. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.\n\nCovering 7.3% of the world population,  the EU in 2014 generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of 18.495 trillion US dollars, constituting approximately 24% of global nominal GDP and 17% when measured in terms of purchasing power parity.  Additionally, 26 out of 28 EU countries have a very high Human Development Index, according to the United Nations Development Program. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the EU has developed a role in external relations and defence. The union maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G8, and the G-20. Because of its global influence, the European Union has been described as a current or as a potential superpower. \n\nHistory\n\nPreliminary (194557)\n\nAfter World War II, European integration was seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which had devastated the continent.  The 1948 Hague Congress was a pivotal moment in European federal history, as it led to the creation of the European Movement International and of the College of Europe, where Europe's future leaders would live and study together.  1952 saw the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, which was declared to be \"a first step in the federation of Europe.\"  The supporters of the Community included Alcide De Gasperi, Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman, and Paul-Henri Spaak. \n\nTreaty of Rome (195792)\n\nIn 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community (EEC) and established a customs union. They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for co-operation in developing nuclear energy. Both treaties came into force in 1958.\n\nThe EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC, although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly.  The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then Étienne Hirsch. Euratom was to integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union among members.  \n\nThrough the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities.   Jean Rey presided over the first merged Commission (Rey Commission). \n\nIn 1973, the Communities enlarged to include Denmark (including Greenland, which later left the Community in 1985, following a dispute over fishing rights), Ireland, and the United Kingdom.  Norway had negotiated to join at the same time, but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum. In 1979, the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held. \n\nGreece joined in 1981, Portugal and Spain following in 1986.  In 1985, the Schengen Agreement paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states.  In 1986, the European flag began to be used by the Community  and the Single European Act was signed.\n\nIn 1990, after the fall of the Eastern Bloc, the former East Germany became part of the Community as part of a reunified Germany.  With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993.\n\nMaastricht Treaty (1992–present) \n\nThe European Union was formally established when the Maastricht Treaty—whose main architects were Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand—came into force on 1 November 1993.  The treaty also gave the name European Community to the EEC, even if it was referred as such before the treaty. In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU. In 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the eurozone has increased to encompass 19 countries. In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined the Union. In 2007, Romania and Bulgaria became EU members. The same year, Slovenia adopted the euro, followed in 2008 by Cyprus and Malta, by Slovakia in 2009, by Estonia in 2011, by Latvia in 2014 and by Lithuania in 2015.\n\nOn 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the European Union, merging the EU three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with a legal personality, created a permanent President of the European Council, the first of which was Herman Van Rompuy, and strengthened the position of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for having \"contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy, and human rights in Europe.\"   In 2013, Croatia became the 28th EU member.   \n\nFrom the beginning of 2010s, the European Union is going through a series of tests, including a debt crisis in some Eurozone countries, increasing migration from Middle Eastern countries, Russian military intervention in Ukraine and the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.\n\nStructural evolution\n\nThe following timeline illustrates the integration that has led to the formation of the present union, in terms of structural development driven by international treaties:\n\nBritish withdrawal\n\nA referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union (announced by British Prime Minister David Cameron on 20 February 2016) was held on 23 June 2016, following years of campaigning by eurosceptics. The result gave a majority of with 51.9% to leave, and 48.1% to remain, on a turnout of 72.2% of registered voters. , the UK has not yet initiated the formal withdrawal procedure, and will not leave the EU until either two years after they notify the European Council of their decision to withdraw, or on the coming into force of a withdrawal agreement.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36618317 EU Brexit referendum: UK 'must not delay leaving'], BBC News. Retrieved 24 June 2016.\n\nGeography\n\nThe EU's member states cover an area of 4423147 km2.This figure includes the extra-European territories of member states which are part of the European Union and excludes the European territories of member states which are not part of the Union. For more information see Special member state territories and the European Union. The EU's highest peak is Mont Blanc in the Graian Alps,  above sea level.  The lowest points in the EU are Lammefjorden, Denmark and Zuidplaspolder, Netherlands, at 7 m (23 ft) below sea level. \nThe landscape, climate, and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline, which is 65993 km long.\n\nIncluding the overseas territories of France which are located outside the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most types of climate from Arctic (North-East Europe) to tropical (French Guyana), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate maritime climate (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a Mediterranean climate (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or hemiboreal climate (Northern Balkans and Central Europe). \n\nThe EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75% of inhabitants (and growing, projected to be 90% in seven member states by 2020) living in urban areas. Cities are largely spread out across the EU, although with a large grouping in and around the Benelux. An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas. In some cases, this urban growth has been due to the influx of EU funds into a region. \n\nMember states\n\nThrough successive enlargements, the European Union has grown from the six founding states—Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands—to the current . Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as \"pooling of sovereignty\".  \n\nTo become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.  No member state has yet left the Union, although Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985.  The Lisbon Treaty now contains a clause under Article 50, providing for a member to leave the EU.  On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted by referendum to leave the EU. However, it remains a member until it officially exits, and has not yet begun formal withdrawal procedures.\n\nThere are six countries that are recognized as candidates for membership: Albania, Iceland, Macedonia,Referred to by the EU as the \"former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\". Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey, though Iceland suspended negotiations in 2013.  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are officially recognised as potential candidates,  with Bosnia and Herzegovina having submitted a membership application.\n\nThe four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are not EU members, but have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties.  The relationships of the European microstates, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation.

had no environmental policy.  Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental protection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards and biotechnology.  According to the Institute for European Environmental Policy, environmental law comprises over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions, making environmental policy a core area of European politics. \n\nEuropean policy-makers originally increased the EU's capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem. \nTrade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state.  In subsequent years, the environment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, principles and procedures. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.\n\nInitially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol despite opposition from the United States. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme,  which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions.  EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.\n\nMitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in future, 20% of the energy used across the EU must be renewable, and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels.   The EU has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions into the economy.  The European Green Capital is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency and quality of life in urban areas to create smart city.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe European Union operates according to the principles of conferral (which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the treaties) and of subsidiarity (which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone). Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives). \n\nConstitutional nature\n\nThe classification of the EU in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated. It began life as an international organisation and gradually developed into a confederation of states. However, since the mid-1960s it has also added several of the key attributes of a federation, such as the direct effect of the law of the general level of government upon the individual  and majority voting in the decision-making process of the general level of government,  without becoming a federation per se. Scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation, being an instance of neither political structure.For example, David Marquand says it is ‘less than a federation but more than a confederation’; Brigid Laffan and Kimmo Kiljunen both see it residing ‘between a confederation and a federation’; Thomas Hueglin and Alan Fenna locate it ‘somewhere between federation and confederation’; and Kalypso Nicolaidis argues ‘it is more than a confederation of sovereign states; ... (however, it) should not become a federal state’. \nMichael Burgess enlarges: the EU 'is not a federation but it is also more than a confederation understood in the classical sense. It exists, then, in a kind of conceptual limbo, a twilight zone ... which has no name'. \nPaul Magnette illuminates the nature of the perceived 'in-betweenness': 'Since the seventeenth century, legal theorists have repeated that only two forms of union between states are possible: either the confederation, born of an international treaty concluded between sovereign states, where all decisions are unanimously adopted by state representatives; or the federal state, established by a constitution, where the law voted on by a bicameral parliament applies directly to the citizens. Tertium non datur. There is no third way ... In these, classic, political terms, the European Union is, strictly speaking, inconceivable'. \nBurgess, Michael (2000) Federalism and European Union: The Building of Europe 1950-2000, Routledge, London, pp. 41-2.

For this reason, the organisation is termed sui generis (incomparable, one of a kind),  although some argue that this designation is no longer valid. \n\nThe organisation has traditionally used the terms \"Community\" and later \"Union\" to describe itself. The difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law (where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations) and international law (where the subjects include sovereign states and international organizations). They can also be seen in the light of differing European and American constitutional traditions. \nEspecially in terms of the European tradition, the term federation is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law; so the EU cannot be called a federation — at least, not without qualification. It is, however, described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature; and so it may be appropriate to consider it a federal union of states, a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of states and the federal state.For the derivation of this concept, see the Introduction of the entry on Federalism. \nLaw, John (2013) [http://www.on-federalism.eu/attachments/169_download.pdf \"How Can We Define Federalism?\"]. Perspectives on Federalism, Vol. 5, No. 3, p. E104. The German Constitutional Court refers to the EU as a Staatenverbund, an intermediate structure between the Staatenbund (confederation of states) and the Bundesstaat (federal state), consistent with this concept. \nThis may be a long-lived political form. Professor Andrew Moravcsik claims that the EU is unlikely to develop further into a federal state, but instead has reached maturity as a constitutional system. \n\nGovernance\n\nThe European Union has seven institutions: the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors. Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.\n\nEuropean Council\n\nThe European Council gives political direction to the EU. It convenes at least four times a year and comprises the President of the European Council (currently Donald Tusk), the President of the European Commission and one representative per member state (either its head of state or head of government). The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini) also takes part in its meetings. It has been described by some as the Union's \"supreme political authority\".  It is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.\n\nThe European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts externally as a \"collective head of state\" and ratifies important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).[https://books.google.com/books?idaMsWxEnaqrUC&pg\nPA146 With US or against US?: European trends in American perspective] Parsons, Jabko. European Union Studies Association, p.146:Fourth, the European Council acts a \"collective head of state\" for the EU.\n\nTasks for the President of the European Council are ensuring the external representation of the EU,  driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states, both during meetings of the European Council and over the periods between them.\n\nThe European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe, an international organisation independent of the EU based in Strasbourg.\n\nCouncil of the European Union\n\nThe Council of the European Union (also called the \"Council\"  and the \"Council of Ministers\", its former title)  forms one half of the EU's legislature. It consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body.  In addition to its legislative functions, the Council also exercises executive functions in relations to the Common Foreign and Security Policy.\n\nEuropean Parliament\n\nThe European Parliament forms the other half of the EU's legislature.\nThe 751 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation. Although MEPs are elected on a national basis, they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub-national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system. \n\nThe European Parliament and the Council of the European Union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure. This also applies to the EU budget. The European Commission is accountable to Parliament, requiring its approval to take office, having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it. The President of the European Parliament (currently Martin Schulz) carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally. The President and Vice-Presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years. \n\nEuropean Commission\n\nThe European Commission acts as the EU's executive arm and is responsible for initiating legislation and the day-to-day running of the EU. The Commission is also seen as the motor of European integration. It operates as a cabinet government, with 28 Commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.\n\nOne of the 28 is the President of the European Commission (currently Jean-Claude Juncker) appointed by the European Council. After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is ex-officio a Vice-President of the Commission and is also chosen by the European Council.  The other 26 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council of the European Union in agreement with the nominated President. The 28 Commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament.\n\nBudget\n\nThe EU had an agreed budget of €120.7 billion for the year 2007 and €864.3 billion for the period 2007–2013,  representing 1.10% and 1.05% of the EU-27's GNI forecast for the respective periods. By comparison, the United Kingdom's expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be €759 billion, and France was estimated to have spent €801 billion. In 1960, the budget of the then European Economic Community was 0.03% of GDP. \n\nIn the 2010 budget of €141.5 billion, the largest single expenditure item is \"cohesion & competitiveness\" with around 45% of the total budget.  Next comes \"agriculture\" with approximately 31% of the total. \"Rural development, environment and fisheries\" takes up around 11%. \"Administration\" accounts for around 6%. The \"EU as a global partner\" and \"citizenship, freedom, security and justice\" bring up the rear with approximately 6% and 1% respectively.\n\nThe Court of Auditors is legally obliged to provide the Parliament and the Council with \"a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions\".  The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.  The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget.\n\nThe European Court of Auditors has signed off the European Union accounts every year since 2007 and, while making it clear that the European Commission has more work to do, has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level.   In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, agriculture and the cohesion fund, were materially affected by error.  The European Commission estimated in 2009 that the financial effect of irregularities was €1,863 million. \n\nCompetences\n\nEU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws. \n\nThat a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.\n\nThe distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories:\n\nLegal system\n\nThe EU is based on a series of treaties. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.  These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislationSee Article 288 (ex Article 249 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uriOJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu] which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.According to the principle of Direct Effect first invoked in the Court of Justice's decision in  See: Craig and de Búrca, ch. 5. The EU has legal personality, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties. \n\nUnder the principle of supremacy, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.According to the principle of Supremacy as established by the ECJ in Case 6/64, Falminio Costa v. ENEL [1964] ECR 585. See Craig and de Búrca, ch. 7. See also: Factortame litigation: Factortame Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603, Solange II (Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft, BVerfG decision of 22 October 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265) and Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze [1974] 2 CMLR 372; Raoul George Nicolo [1990] 1 CMLR 173.\n\nCourts of Justice\n\nThe judicial branch of the EU—formally called the Court of Justice of the European Union—consists of three courts: the Court of Justice, the General Court, and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal. Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU. \n\nThe Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and cases referred to it by the courts of member states.  The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts,  and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and its civil service.  Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law. \n\nFundamental rights\n\nThe treaties declare that the EU itself is \"founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities ... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.\" \n\nIn 2009 the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the \"constitutional traditions common to the member states.\"  The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights. \n\nAlthough signing the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership,It is effectively treated as one of the Copenhagen criteria, [http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link\n/Documents/AdoptedText/ta08/ERES1610.htm Assembly.coe.int.] It should be noted that this is a political and not a legal requirement for membership.  previously, the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a stateThe European Convention on Human Rights was previously only open to members of the Council of Europe ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm Article 59.1 of the Convention]), and even now only states may become member of the Council of Europe ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/001.htm Article 4 of the Statute of the Council of Europe]). nor had the competence to accede.Opinion (2/92) of the European Court of Justice on \"Accession by the Community to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\" [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994V0002:FR:NOT 1996 E.C.R. I-1759] (in French), ruled that the European Community did not have the competence to accede to the ECHR. The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it.\n\nAlthough, the EU is independent from Council of Europe, they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law, human rights and democracy. Further European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter, the source of law of Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by Council of Europe. The EU also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership. \n\nActs\n\nThe main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: regulations, directives, and decisions. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,See: Case 34/73, Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri\nCELEX:61973J0034:EN:NOT [1973] ECR 981]. and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions. Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 28 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115 When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states.\n\nDecisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in competition law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy. \n\nArea of freedom, security and justice\n\nSince the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of freedom, security and justice, initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: Europol for co-operation of police forces,  Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors,  and Frontex for co-operation between border control authorities.  The EU also operates the Schengen Information System which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the Schengen Agreement and the associated cross border crime.\n\nFurthermore, the Union has legislated in areas such as extradition,  family law,  asylum law,  and criminal justice.  Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.See Articles 157 (ex Article 141) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uriOJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu] In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.See Article 2(7) of the Amsterdam Treaty on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 eur-lex.europa.eu]  By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work-place, age discrimination, and racial discrimination.Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19 July 2000, p. 22–26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2 December 2000, p. 16–22).\n\nForeign relations\n\nForeign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the Common Commercial policy.  Steps for a more wide ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act. EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty. \n\nThe aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.  The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq. \n\nThe coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The High Representative heads up the European External Action Service (EEAS), a unique EU department  that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.  The EEAS will serve as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the European Union. \n\nBesides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through enlargement. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries.  This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as \"soft power\", as opposed to military \"hard power\".\n\nMilitary\n\nThe predecessors of the European Union were not devised as a military alliance because NATO was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes. 22 EU members are members of NATO  while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality.  The Western European Union, a military alliance with a mutual defence clause, was disbanded in 2010 as its role had been transferred to the EU. \n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the United Kingdom spent $61 billion on defence in 2014, placing it fifth in the world, while France spent $53 billion, the sixth largest.  Together, the UK and France account for approximately 40 per cent of EU's defence budget and 50 per cent of its military capacity.  Both are officially recognised nuclear weapon states holding permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.\n\nFollowing the Kosovo War in 1999, the European Council agreed that \"the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO\". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 personnel. \n\nEU forces have been deployed on peacekeeping missions from middle and northern Africa to the western Balkans and western Asia.  EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies, including the European Defence Agency, European Union Satellite Centre and the European Union Military Staff.  Frontex is an agency of the EU established to manage the cooperation between national border guards securing its external borders. It aims to detect and stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration. In December 2015 the European Commission presented its proposal for a new European Border and Coast Guard Agency having a stronger role and mandate along with national authorities for border management. In an EU consisting of 28 members, substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states. \n\nHumanitarian aid\n\nThe European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department, or \"ECHO\", provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. In 2012, its budget amounted to €874 million, 51% of the budget went to Africa and 20% to Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Pacific, and 20% to the Middle East and Mediterranean. \n\nHumanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70%) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund (30%).Mikaela Gavas 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id\n5078&titleeuropean-development-cooperation-financial-perspectives Financing European development cooperation: the Financial Perspectives 2014–2020.] London: Overseas Development Institute The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments. The 'geographic' instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI, €16.9 billion, 2007–2013), which must spend 95% of its budget on overseas development assistance (ODA), and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes. The European Development Fund (EDF, €22.7 bn, 2008–2013) is made up of voluntary contributions by member states, but there is pressure to merge the EDF into the budget-financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0.7% target and allow the European Parliament greater oversight.\n\nHowever, five countries have reached the 0.7% target: Sweden, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom.   In 2011, EU aid was 0.42% of the EU's GNI making it the world's most generous aid donor.  The previous Commissioner for Aid, Louis Michel, has called for aid to be delivered more rapidly, to greater effect, and on humanitarian principles. \n\nEconomy\n\nThe five largest economies in the world according to the IMF by nominal GDP in 2014. \n\nThe European Union has established a single market across the territory of all its members representing 508 million citizens. In 2014, the EU had a combined GDP of 18.640 trillion international dollars, a 20% share of global gross domestic product by purchasing power parity (PPP).  As a political entity the European Union is represented in the World Trade Organization (WTO). EU member states own the estimated largest net wealth in the world, equal to 30% of the $223 trillion global wealth.\n\n19 member states have joined a monetary union known as the eurozone, which uses the Euro as a single currency. The currency union represents 338 million EU citizens. The euro is the second largest reserve currency as well as the second most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar.   \n\nOf the top 500 largest corporations in the world measured by revenue in 2010, 161 have their headquarters in the EU.  In 2016, unemployment in the EU stood at 8.9%  while inflation was at 2.2%, and the current account balance at −0.9% of GDP.\n\nThere is a significant variance for GDP (PPP) per capita within individual EU states. The difference between the richest and poorest regions (276 NUTS-2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) ranged, in 2014, from 30% of the EU28 average to 539%, or from €8,200 to €148,000 (about US$9,000 to US$162,000).\n\nStructural Funds and Cohesion Funds are supporting the development of underdeveloped regions of the EU. Such regions are primarily located in the states of central and southern Europe.   Several funds provide emergency aid, support for candidate members to transform their country to conform to the EU's standard (Phare, ISPA, and SAPARD), and support to the Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS). TACIS has now become part of the worldwide EuropeAid programme. EU research and technological framework programmes sponsor research conducted by consortia from all EU members to work towards a single European Research Area. \n\nInternal market\n\nTwo of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently becoming a single market, and a customs union between its member states. The single market involves the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU,  and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union.  Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU. \n\nFree movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.  Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.\n\nThe free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states. \n\nThe free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed Directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.  According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.\n\nMonetary union\n\nThe creation of a European single currency became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the Maastricht Treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union. The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.\n\nIn 1999 the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with eleven member states joining. In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries. \n\nSince its launch the euro has become the second reserve currency in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro.  The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the European Central Bank (ECB). \n\nThe ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability. It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks, which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the President of the ECB, who is appointed by the European Council, the Vice-President of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 28 EU member states. \n\nThe European System of Financial Supervision is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. To complement this framework, there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the ECB. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU. \n\nTo prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level.\n\nEnergy\n\nIn 2006, the EU-27 had a gross inland energy consumption of 1,825 million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). Around 46% of the energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54% was imported. In these statistics, nuclear energy is treated as primary energy produced in the EU, regardless of the source of the uranium, of which less than 3% is produced in the EU.  Nuclear energy and renewable energy are treated differently from oil, gas , and coal in this respect.\n\nThe EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007. \n\nThe EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia  and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.\n\nThe EU imports 82% of its oil, 57% of its natural gas  and 97.48% of its uranium demands. Because of Europe's dependence on Russian energy the EU is attempting to diversify its energy supply. \n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe EU is working to improve cross-border infrastructure within the EU, for example through the Trans-European Networks (TEN). Projects under TEN include the Channel Tunnel, LGV Est, the Fréjus Rail Tunnel, the Öresund Bridge, the Brenner Base Tunnel and the Strait of Messina Bridge. In 2010 the estimated network covers: 75200 km of roads; 78000 km of railways; 330 airports; 270 maritime harbours; and 210 internal harbours.  \n\nRail transport in Europe is being synchronised with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), an initiative to greatly enhance safety, increase efficiency of trains and enhance cross-border interoperability of rail transport in Europe by replacing signalling equipment with digitized mostly wireless versions and by creating a single Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems.\n\nThe developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.  The Polish road network was upgraded such as the A4 autostrada.  \n\nThe Galileo positioning system is another EU infrastructure project. Galileo is a proposed Satellite navigation system, to be built by the EU and launched by the European Space Agency (ESA). The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the EU's dependency on the US-operated Global Positioning System, but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for greater accuracy, given the aged nature of the GPS system. \n\nAgriculture\n\nThe Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is one of the long lasting policies of the European Community.  The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers.Article 39 (ex Article 33) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri\nOJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu] It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60% of the then European Community's annual budget, and  accounts for around 34%. \n\nThe policy's price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction. These were intervention stores of products bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the developing world.  Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.\n\nSince the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels. One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU. \n\nCompetition\n\nThe EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.Article 3(1)(g) of the Treaty of Rome The Commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues, approving mergers, breaking up cartels, working for economic liberalisation and preventing state aid. \n\nThe Competition Commissioner, currently Margrethe Vestager, is one of the most powerful positions in the Commission, notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans-national corporations.  For example, in 2001 the Commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States (GE and Honeywell) which had already been approved by their national authority.  Another high-profile case against Microsoft, resulted in the Commission fining Microsoft over €777 million following nine years of legal action. \n\nDemographics\n\nAs of 1 January 2016, the population of the European Union is about 510.1 million people. In 2013, 5,075,000 live births were registered and 4,999,200 deaths. The net migration to the EU was +653,100. In 2010, 47.3 million people who lived in the EU were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million), Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million). \n\nUrbanisation\n\nThe EU contains 16 cities with populations of over one million. Besides many large cities, the EU also includes several densely populated regions that have no single core but have emerged from the connection of several cities and now encompass large metropolitan areas. The largest are Rhine-Ruhr having approximately 11.5 million inhabitants (Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf et al.), Randstad approx. 7 million (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht et al.), Frankfurt Rhine-Main approx. 5.8 million (Frankfurt, Wiesbaden et al.), the Flemish Diamond approx. 5.5 million (urban area in between Antwerp, Brussels, Leuven and Ghent), Upper Silesia approx. 5.3 million (Katowice, Ostrava) and Øresund approx. 3.7 million (Copenhagen, Malmö). \n\nLanguages\n\nAmong the many languages and dialects used in the EU, it has 24 official and working languages: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish.   Important documents, such as legislation, are translated into every official language.\n\nThe European Parliament provides translation into all languages for documents and its plenary sessions.  Some institutions use only a handful of languages as internal working languages.  Catalan, Galician, Basque, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh are not official languages of the EU but have semi-official status in that official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens of the EU have the right to correspond with the institutions using them.\n\nLanguage policy is the responsibility of member states, but EU institutions promote the learning of other languages.See Articles 165 and 166 (ex Articles 149 and 150) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri\nOJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]  English is the most widely spoken language in the EU, being spoken by 51% of the EU population when counting both native and non-native speakers.  German is the most widely spoken mother tongue, being spoken by 16% of the EU population. 56% of EU citizens are able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue.  Most official languages of the EU belong to the Indo-European language family, except Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, which belong to the Uralic language family, and Maltese, which is a Semitic language. Most EU official languages are written in the Latin alphabet except Bulgarian, which is written in the Cyrillic alphabet, and Greek, which is written in the Greek alphabet.  These are the three official scripts of the European Union. \n\nBesides the 24 official languages, there are about 150 regional and minority languages, spoken by up to 50 million people. Although EU programmes can support regional and minority languages, the protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the individual member states. The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage.\n\nThe European Day of Languages is held annually on 26 September and is aimed at encouraging language learning across Europe.\n\nReligion\n\nThe EU is a secular body with no formal connection to any religion. The Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognises the \"status under national law of churches and religious associations\" as well as that of \"philosophical and non-confessional organisations\".\n\nThe preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the \"cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe\".  Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or God, or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped. \n\nChristians in the EU are divided among members of Catholicism (both Roman and Eastern Rite), numerous Protestant denominations, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 2009, the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13 million,  and an estimated Jewish population of over a million.  The other world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism and Sikhism are also represented in the EU population.\n\nAccording to new polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Christianity is the largest religion in the European Union, accounting for 72% of the EU population. Catholics are the largest Christian group, accounting for 48% of the EU population, while Protestants make up 12%, Eastern Orthodox make up 8% and other Christians make up 4%. \n\nEurostat's Eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52% of EU citizens believed in a God, 27% in \"some sort of spirit or life force\", and 18% had no form of belief.  Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years.  The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16%) and the Czech Republic (19%). The most religious countries were Malta (95%, predominantly Roman Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90% of citizens professing a belief in God. Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16 and those \"positioning themselves on the right of the political scale\".\n\nEducation and science\n\nBasic education is an area where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20 years, it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life. \n\nThere are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.   Through its support of the Bologna Process, the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.\n\nScientific development is facilitated through the EU's Framework Programmes, the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent European Research Council allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.  EU research and technological framework programmes deal in a number of areas, for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels. \n\nHealth care\n\nAlthough the EU has no major competences in the field of health care, Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms that \"A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities\". The European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumers seeks to align national laws on the protection of people's health, on the consumers' rights, on the safety of food and other products.   \n\nHealth care in the EU is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level. The systems are primarily publicly funded through taxation (universal health care). Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private (non-subsidised) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance.\n\nAll EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free European Health Insurance Card which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries.  A directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting co-operation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for European patients.   \n\nCulture \n\nCultural co-operation between member states has been a concern of the EU since its inclusion as a community competency in the Maastricht Treaty.  Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the Culture 2000 7-year programme, the European Cultural Month event,  the MEDIA Programme,  and orchestras such as the European Union Youth Orchestra.\n\nThe European Capital of Culture programme selects one or more cities in every year to assist the cultural development of that city.  53 EU cities have been part of this initiative up to 2016.\n\nSport\n\nSport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. However, there are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the Bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship.  The Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity.  This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport, which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.  The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project. \n\nAssociation Football is the most popular sport in almost all EU countries. Club teams from the EU are the highest paid in the world. Other team sports like rugby, ice hockey, basketball, cricket, handball, volleyball and water polo are also popular in some member states.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe flag of the Union consists of a circle of 12 golden stars on a blue background. The blue represents the West, while the number and position of the stars represent completeness and unity, respectively.  Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag was adopted by the European Communities, the predecessors of the present Union, in 1986.\n\nUnited in Diversity was adopted as the motto of the Union in the year 2000, having been selected from proposals submitted by school pupils. Since 1985, the flag day of the Union has been Europe Day, on 9 May (the date of the 1950 Schuman declaration). The anthem of the Union is an instrumental version of the prelude to the Ode to Joy, the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony. The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions. \n\nBesides naming the continent, the Greek mythological figure of Europa has frequently been employed as a personification of Europe. Known from the myth in which Zeus seduces her in the guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present Union. Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the Union's institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of Euro banknotes. The bull is, for its part, depicted on all residence permit cards.\n\nCharles the Great, also known as Charlemagne () and later recognized as Pater Europae (\"Father of Europe\"),      has a symbolic relevance to Europe. The Commission has named one of its central buildings in Brussels after Charlemagne and the city of Aachen has since 1949 awarded the Charlemagne Prize to champions of European unification.  Since 2008, the organisers of this prize, in conjunction with the European Parliament, have awarded the Charlemagne Youth Prize in recognition of similar efforts by young people. \n\nMedia \n\nMedia freedom is a fundamental right that applies to all member states of the European Union and its citizens, as defined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as well as the European Convention on Human Rights.  Within the EU enlargement process, guaranteeing media freedom is named a \"key indicator of a country's readiness to become part of the EU\"."

                "An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process.  It may be an improvement upon a machine or product, or a new process for creating an object or a result.  An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough.  Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field. An inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure.\n\nSome inventions can be patented.  A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention.  The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary from country to country, and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.\n\nAnother meaning of invention is cultural invention, which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others.  The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books. \nInvention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.\n\nThe Process of Invention \n\nPractical means of invention \n\nThe idea for an invention may be developed on paper or on a computer, by writing or drawing, by trial and error, by making models, by experimenting, by testing and/or by making the invention in its whole form. Brainstorming also can spark new ideas for an invention.  Collaborative creative processes are frequently used by engineers, designers, architects and scientists. Co-inventors are frequently named on patents.\n\nIn addition, many inventors keep records of their working process - notebooks, photos, etc., including Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, Evangelista Torricelli, Thomas Jefferson and Albert Einstein.    \n\nIn the process of developing an invention, the initial idea may change. The invention may become simpler, more practical, it may expand, or it may even morph into something totally different. Working on one invention can lead to others too. \n\nHistory shows that turning the concept of an invention into a working device is not always swift or direct.  Inventions may also become more useful after time passes and other changes occur.  For example, the parachute became more useful once powered flight was a reality. \n\nConceptual means \n\nInvention is often a creative process. An open and curious mind allows an inventor to see beyond what is known. Seeing a new possibility, connection, or relationship can spark an invention. Inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts or elements from different realms that would not normally be put together. Sometimes inventors disregard the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields.  Several concepts may be considered when thinking about invention.\n\nPlay \n\nPlay may lead to invention. Childhood curiosity, experimentation, and imagination can develop one's play instinct—an inner need according to Carl Jung. Inventors feel the need to play with things that interest them, and to explore, and this internal drive brings about novel creations.  \n\nSometimes inventions and ideas may seem to arise spontaneously while daydreaming, especially when the mind is free from its usual concerns.  For example, both J. K. Rowling (the creator of Harry Potter)  and Frank Hornby (the inventor of Meccano)  first had their ideas while on train journeys.\n\nRe-envision \n\nTo invent is to see anew.  Inventors often envision a new idea, seeing it in their mind's eye. New ideas can arise when the conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem, when the inventor's focus is on something else, or while relaxing or sleeping. A novel idea may come in a flash—a Eureka! moment. For example, after years of working to figure out the general theory of relativity, the solution came to Einstein suddenly in a dream \"like a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision\".  Inventions can also be accidental, such as in the case of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon).\n\nInsight \n\nInsight can also be a vital element of invention. Such inventive insight may begin with questions, doubt or a hunch. It may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration. For example, the odd metallic color of plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties, inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting plastic-—an invention that won the Nobel Prize in 2000 and has led to innovative lighting, display screens, wallpaper and much more (see conductive polymer, and organic light-emitting diode or OLED). \n\nExploration \n\nInvention is often an exploratory process with an uncertain or unknown outcome. There are failures as well as successes. Inspiration can start the process, but no matter how complete the initial idea, inventions typically must be developed.\n\nImprovement \n\nInventors may, for example, try to improve something by making it more effective, healthier, faster, more efficient, easier to use, serve more purposes, longer lasting, cheaper, more ecologically friendly, or aesthetically different, lighter weight, more ergonomic, structurally different, with new light or color properties, etc.\n\nImplementing Inventions \n\nIn economic theory, inventions are one of the chief examples of \"positive externalities\", a beneficial side-effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity.  One of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalized—unless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties, the parties are under-rewarded for their inventions, and systematic under-rewarding leads to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions.  The patent system captures those positive externalities for the inventor or other patent owner, so that the economy as a whole invests an optimum amount of resources in the invention process.\n\nInvention vs. innovation \n\nIn the social sciences, an innovation is something that is new, better, and has been adopted.  The theory for adoption of an innovation, called diffusion of innovations, considers the likelihood that an innovation is adopted and the taxonomy of persons likely to adopt it or spur its adoption. This theory was first put forth by Everett Rogers.   Gabriel Tarde also dealt with the adoption of innovations in his Laws of Imitation. \n\nPurposes of invention \n\nAn invention can serve many purposes. These purposes might differ significantly and may change over time.  An invention, or a further-developed version of it, may serve purposes never envisioned by its original inventor(s) or by others living at the time of its original invention.  As an example, consider all the kinds of plastic developed, their many uses, and the significant growth this material invention is still undergoing.           \n\nInvention as defined by patent law \n\nThe term invention is also an important legal concept and central to patent law systems worldwide. As is often the case for legal concepts, its legal meaning is slightly different from common usage of the word.  Additionally, the legal concept of invention is quite different in American and European patent law.\n\nIn Europe, the first test a patent application must pass is, \"Is this an invention?\" If it is, subsequent questions are whether it is new, and sufficiently inventive. The implication—counter intuitively—is that a legal invention is not inherently novel. Whether a patent application relates to an invention is governed by Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, that excludes, e.g., discoveries as such and software as such. The EPO Boards of Appeal decided that the technical character of an application is decisive for it to represent an invention, following an age-old Italians and German tradition. British courts don't agree with this interpretation. Following a 1959 Australian decision (\"NRDC\"), they believe that it is not possible to grasp the invention concept in a single rule. A British court once stated that the technical character test implies a \"...restatement of the problem in more imprecise terminology.\"\n\nIn the United States, all patent applications are considered inventions. The statute explicitly says that the American invention concept includes discoveries (35 USC § 100(a)), contrary to the European invention concept. The European invention concept corresponds to the American \"patentable subject matter\" concept: the first test a patent application is submitted to. While the statute (35 USC § 101) virtually poses no limits to patenting whatsoever, courts have decided in binding precedents that abstract ideas, natural phenomena and laws of nature are not patentable. Various attempts were made to substantiate the \"abstract idea\" test, which suffers from abstractness itself, but eventually none of them was successful. The last attempt so far was the \"machine or transformation\" test, but the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2010 that it is merely an indication at best.\n\nInvention in the arts \n\nInvention has a long and important history in the arts.  Inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the creative process.   While some inventions in the arts are patentable, others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them.  (see patent).\n\nSome inventions in art include the:\n\n* Collage and construction invented by Picasso\n* Readymade invented by Marcel Duchamp\n* mobile invented by Alexander Calder\n* Combine invented by Robert Rauschenberg\n* Shaped painting invented by Frank Stella\n* Motion picture, the invention of which is attributed to Eadweard Muybridge  \n\nLikewise, Jackson Pollock invented an entirely new form of painting and a new kind of abstraction by dripping, pouring, splashing and splattering paint onto un-stretched canvas lying on the floor.\n\nInventive tools of the artist's trade also produced advances in creativity.  Impressionist painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible, resealable metal paint tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors.  Inventions originally created in the form of artwork can also develop other uses, i.e., Alexander Calder's mobile, which is now commonly used over babies' cribs.  Funds generated from patents on inventions in art, design and architecture can support the realization of the invention or other creative work.  Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi's 1879 design patent on the Statue of Liberty helped fund the famous statue because it covered small replicas, including those sold as souvenirs. \n\nList of artistic inventors \n\nOther artists, designers and architects who are or were inventors include:\n\n*Filippo Brunelleschi\n*Le Corbusier\n*Naum Gabo\n*Frederick Hart\n*Charles Eames\n*William Morris\n*Louis Comfort Tiffany\n*John La Farge\n*Buckminster Fuller\n*Walt Disney\n*Man Ray\n*Yves Klein\n*Henry N. Cobb\n*I. M. Pei\n*Kenneth Snelson\n*John Lennon\n*Chuck (Charles) Hoberman\n*Ingo Maurer\n*Thomas Edison\n*Benjamin Franklin\n*George Washington Carver\n\nSome of their inventions have been patented.  Others might have fulfilled the requirements of a patent, like the Cubist image."

                "The Father of Invention - The New York Times\nThe New York Times\nN.Y. / Region |The Father of Invention\nSearch\nContinue reading the main story\nTHE simple version of the story of Thomas Alva Edison, the one most schoolchildren learn, is that he invented the phonograph, the incandescent light bulb and the motion picture camera.\nThese three innovations were wonders in their time. But they do not begin to explain how this man -- who spent most of his adulthood living and working in New Jersey and whose 150th birthday is being celebrated this year -- changed the world.\nVirtually every Edison scholar now agrees that Edison's most important accomplishment was not the inventions themselves, but the invention of the invention industry. Edison is nothing less than the father of modern research and development. Part businessman, part scientist, part publicity man, Edison took his essential curiosity about the way things worked and -- using a large posse of laboratory assistants, the patent system and lawyers to enforce the patents -- leveraged it into an industrial empire that, at its peak in the mid-1910's, supported a 10,000-worker factory here.\n''Edison does probably more than any individual in 19th-century industry to establish the idea that you can have a steady stream of innovations, and that technology can be deployed for strategic purposes,'' says W. Bernard Carlson, associate professor of technology, culture and communication at the University of Virginia.\nContinue reading the main story\nAll the great R & D labs of the pharmaceutical industry, which dot Route 1 and other New Jersey highways, owe their existence to Edison's idea that great discoveries are best made not by solitary geniuses but in large, well-organized, well-financed groups.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nBut the limits of Edison's genius are as interesting as his accomplishments. One of the Edison's most important legacies is his part in creating the modern consumer market. Edison literally wired us, turning us into a nation of workaholics and insomniacs. It was his sound recording system and his movie camera that would lay the foundation for Motown and Hollywood.\nFor all Edison's genius in creating the world of mass media, it was a world he never quite comprehended; although he delivered us into the 20th century he was still, at heart, a 19th-century man. ''Edison gets killed in the phonograph business and, more importantly, in motion pictures,'' Prof. Carlson says. ''What he never really understands is that a big piece of the business is going to be in what we would call the 'software' side.''\nAlthough historians of technology will endlessly debate whether Edison's story can best be understood by looking at the modern-day figures of Steven Jobs, who largely invented the personal computer, or Bill Gates, who has profited most by that invention, Professor Carlson prefers to compare Edison to Moses.\n''He invents the technology that undergirds the consumer culture of the 20th century,'' Professor Carlson says. ''He brings Americans there. But he's unable to participate. Like Moses, Edison was unable to enter promised land.''\nPatents: Bell 30, Edison 1,093\nTo get a sense of why Edison will always be remembered, one only has to compare him with his competitor Alexander Graham Bell. Bell and Edison had a great deal in common. Both famous inventors were born in 1847, and both were concerned with the problems of the deaf. Edison himself was partly deaf, a fact that Neil Baldwin, author of the 1995 biography ''Edison: Inventing the Century,'' says explains much of his personality and his life -- his inability to fit into a regular school, his reputation for being antisocial and his failure in the record industry. And Bell taught the deaf.\nAnd so it is no coincidence that both Edison and Bell would be instrumental in the two great inventions concerning sound. Although Bell invented the telephone in 1876, it was Edison's modification of the transmitter two years later that made the telephone a practical device. And while Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, using tin foil as the recording medium, it was Bell who nine years later introduced the wax recording cylinder, making Edison's device more useful.\nBut while Bell went on from sound transmission and recording to tinker with aeronautics and hyrofoil boats, none of his later work approached the significance of Edison's electrification system, nor did Bell's inventiveness begin to match the breadth of Edison's. In the end, the story of the two inventors can be best told by the number of patents they were granted. Edison was granted 1,093 patents, Bell only 30.\n''Bell has a personal problem that he wants to solve and an idea. Edison wants to create change. He'll work for anybody and tackle any project,'' says Bill Pretzer, director of educational programs at the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Mich., where Edison's Menlo Park lab has been reconstructed. ''Bell has a one-person staff in a small garret. Edison creates a business out of inventing.''\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nBoth in Menlo Park, where Edison invented the phonograph and the electric light system, and in West Orange, where he worked until his death at age 84 in 1931, Edison employed as many as 200 laboratory assistants and machinists. ''He brought together the skilled workers, the equipment they needed, the raw materials and a research library, with a librarian who read French and German,'' Dr. Pretzer says. ''Together with those things, he brought financial backing.''\nThe fact that Edison could think of an idea, sketch it out in a laboratory notebook, take it to his machine shop and see his concept materialize almost instantly gave him an enormous advantage over other inventors of the time. ''He was able to do things in a week that would have taken other people three months,'' says Bob Rosenberg, director of the Thomas A. Edison Papers Project, a joint project of the Edison site and Rutgers University, which has put five million pages of Edison documents into order. ''Edison was the Mozart of invention, at a time that was the heyday of American inventors.''\nTo put Edison in proper context, one has to imagine a world in which voices did not come out of boxes, and pictures did not move. ''They talk about people being frightened at the early motion pictures,'' says Maryanne Gerbauckas, a National Park Service employee who is superintendent of the Edison National Historic Site here.\nEven more amazing in its time was the phonograph. Although Edison had already made contributions to the world of telegraphy and had invented the stock ticker by this time, it was the phonograph in 1877 that made his name a household word.\n''People couldn't believe it,'' says Neil Barker, a park service ranger who leads tours through the Edison site. ''People thought Edison was a trickster. Some thought he was a ventriloquist.''\nThe invention was so exciting that President Rutherford B. Hayes summoned him to the White House to demonstrate it. In a scene described in Dr. Baldwin's book, President Hayes and Edison stayed up past 3 A.M. to play with the new machine, even waking the First Lady to share in the fun.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address. Please re-enter.\nYou must select a newsletter to subscribe to.\nSign Up\nPrivacy Policy\nOne gets a sense of this wonder at the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, which is run by the Park Service. It is almost impossible not to be moved, as 60,000 tourists a year are, by hearing Edison himself singing ''Mary Had a Little Lamb'' on a copy of one of the world's first recordings, or by watching ''The Great Train Robbery,'' which Edison's company produced and which was partly filmed at the South Mountain Reservation nearby.\nNationally Revered But Locally Ignored\nIf Edison's place in American history is secure, his place in New Jersey history is somewhat shaky.\nConsider, first, the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange. The red-brick building where Edison spent the last 44 years of his career is crammed between an A&P and a discount wallpaper store, and across a busy street from its small parking lot, with no traffic light to help visitors cross.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nFour years ago, the National Trust for Historic Preservation put Edison's ''Invention Factory'' in West Orange on its annual endangered list. Although a lot of work has been done since then to protect the buildings and their contents, the site is still less than an archivist's dream. The ground vault containing Edison's papers has water leaks, and the main building's second floor -- which contains Edison's precision machine shop, trade catalogues, blueprints of Edison inventions and paper wrappers from many Edison phonograph disks -- is ventilated by an open door without a screen.\nThere are plans to build a separate, properly ventilated building to house a visitor's center and administrative complex and protect the museum's artifacts, but so far not much money.\nIn Menlo Park, where Edison did some of his most important work, the main thing marking these accomplishments is the 131-foot concrete ''lightbulb tower.'' Remnants of the Menlo Park buildings were shipped to Michigan in 1929 to be part of what would become the Henry Ford Museum.\nJohn Cunningham, an expert in New Jersey history, says when he first came upon the West Orange facility in 1954 he was shocked to see a letter from the Studebaker brothers and Henry Ford to Edison ''just lying around.''\nMr. Cunningham adds that when he approached Gov. Brendan Byourne -- who came from West Orange -- to raise money for the Edison site in 1979, ''he told me point blank the state would have no interest in it. He said, 'You know,. hHe didn't treat his people very well'. ''\nUnloved as a Boss And a Neighbor\nAlthough Edison is venerated today, there are hints that he was not universally loved in his life. He lived in a grand home called Glenmont in West Orange in the affluent  Llewellyn Park section. His neighbors may have resented the pollution, noise and riffraff from the 10,000-worker factory nearby.\nEdison also worked himself hard -- keeping a cot in his office so he would not have to go home to sleep -- and undoubtedly demanded much of his employees. A framed quote from Sir Joshua Reynolds -- ''There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking'' --  hangs in several places in the West Orange facility, suggesting that Edison was on the lookout for shirking.\nPaul Israel, managing editor of the book edition of the Edison Papers, who is writing an Edison biography, says there are also stories of Edison ''walking through the plant, just sort of firing people.'' Edison certainly downsized when he pulled out of the music industry. ''A lot of the reaction that exists today in West Orange has to do with that downsizing,'' Dr. Israel says.\nAdvertisement\nAnd while the people of Menlo Park were so proud of him that they named their township Edison in 1954, he left that town without paying his bills; his house was auctioned by the sheriff because of two unpaid notes.\nEdison was also notoriously litigious, a zealot for enforcing patents.\nBut his biographer Neil Baldwin believes that Edison is unfairly faulted for lacking social skills, when it was really his hearing that was the problem. His hearing was so bad, Dr. Baldwin says, that Edison trained his second wife, Mina, to secretly tap out the conversation in Morse code on his knee during dinner parties.\nJust as Edison has left an imprint on the New Jersey, the state played a role in the career of Edison.\nEdison missed his big opportunity in the music industry because he tried -- and failed -- to impose his own taste on the public. He hated jazz, and he didn't want to indulge celebrities like Enrico Caruso, who was the star of the Victor Talking Machine Company. Edison missed out on radio altogether, and couldn't believe people would want to let an uncensored stream of programming into their homes. And he made the same mistakes in the movie business.\nProfessor Carlson of the University of Virginia blames some of this on New Jersey provincialism. The first great movie moguls were former furriers from the Lower East Side, who knew what the common people liked. Edison, and his top managers, living in prosperous Essex County, may simply have been out of touch with popular culture.\n''By 1910, the movies had come to be viewed as working-class amusement, and it was no surprise that the elite of Montclair refused to permit movies in the town,'' Professor Carlson wrote in 1992. ''Edison's associates knew that their social standing in the wealthy New Jersey suburbs of Montclair and South Orange would not advance if it became known that their movies catered to the vulgar tastes of the working class.''",

Edison Papers Project , bought an interest in the invention for $100 and took it to Washington , D.C. to exhibit to a committee of Congress. The chairman of the committee, unimpressed with the speed with which the instrument could record votes, told him that \"if there is any invention on earth that we don't want down here, that is it.\" The slow pace of roll call voting in Congress and other legislatures enabled members to filibuster legislation or convince others to change their votes. Edison's vote recorder was never used.\nEdison went on to hold 1,093 U.S. patents, many of them commercially successful, such as the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the alkaline storage battery.  In 1929, Edison said: “None of my inventions came by accident. I see a worthwhile need to be met and I make trial after trial until it comes. What it boils down to is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.” Two years later, inventor and former employee Nikola Tesla had this to say (in the ) the day after Edison died: \"If he had a needle to find in a haystack he would not stop to reason where it was most likely to be, but would proceed at once, with the feverish diligence of a bee, to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search. ...

                "Thomas Edison\nPhoto provided by: The Library of Congress\nThomas Alva Edison\nThomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor, scientist, and businessman who developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\" (now Edison, New Jersey) by a newspaper reporter, he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large teamwork to the process of invention, and therefore is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.\nEdison is considered one of the most prolific inventors in history, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. He is credited with numerous inventions that contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a mechanical vote recorder, a battery for an electric car, electrical power, recorded music and motion pictures. His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison originated the concept and implementation of electric-power generation and distribution to homes, businesses, and factories – a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. His first power station was on Manhattan Island, New York.\nThomas Edison was born in Milan, Ohio and grew up in Port Huron, Michigan. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison, Jr. (1804–96, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia, Canada) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810–1871).  His father had to escape from Canada because he took part in the unsuccessful Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837. Edison considered himself to be of Dutch ancestry.   In school, the young Edison's mind often wandered, and his teacher, the Reverend Engle, was overheard calling him \"addled\". This ended Edison's three months of official schooling. Edison recalled later, \"My mother was the making of me. She was so true, so sure of me; and I felt I had something to live for, someone I must not disappoint.\" His mother homeschooled him.  Much of his education came from reading R.G. Parker's School of Natural Philosophy and The Cooper Union. Edison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around the middle of his career Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in Smiths Creek, Michigan, along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later years he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the ears.  Edison's family was forced to move to Port Huron, Michigan, when the railroad bypassed Milan in 1854, but his life there was bittersweet. He sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit, and he sold vegetables to supplement his income. This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, which is still in existence and is one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.\nEdison became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, station agent J.U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway.   In 1866, at the age of 19, Thomas Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a lead-acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.\nOne of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey home. Some of Edison's earliest inventions were related to telegraphy, including a stock ticker. His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, (U. S. Patent 90,646), which was granted on June 1, 1869.

                "Thomas Edison's Creative Thinking Habits - Think Jar Collective\nThink Jar Collective\nCreativity Techniques\nThomas Edison was granted 1,093 patents for inventions that ranged from the lightbulb, typewriter, electric pen, phonograph, motion picture camera and alkaline storage battery—to the talking doll and a concrete house that could be built in one day from a cast-iron mold. When he died in 1931, he left 3500 notebooks which are preserved today in the temperature-controlled vaults of the West Orange Laboratory Archives at the Edison National Historic Site in New Jersey.\nThe notebooks read like a turbulent brainstorm and present a verbal and visual biography of Edison’s mind at work. Spanning most of his six-decade career, the notebooks are yielding fresh clues as to how Edison, who had virtually no formal education, could achieve such an astounding inventive record that is still unrivalled. The notebooks illustrate how Edison conceived his ideas from their earliest inceptions and show in great detail how he developed and implemented them. Following are some of Edison’s creative-thinking strategies:\n1. Go for QUANTITY\nFor starters, Edison believed that to discover a good idea you had to generate many ideas. Out of quantity comes quality. He set idea quotas for all his workers. His own quota was one minor invention every 10 days and a major invention every six months. It took over 50,000 experiments to invent the alkaline storage cell battery and 9000 to perfect the lightbulb. Edison looked at creativity as simply good, honest, hard work. Genius, he once said, is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration. For every brilliant idea he had there was a dud like the horse-drawn contraption that would collect snow and ice in the winter and compress it into blocks that families could use in the summer as a refrigerant.\nIncreasing your idea production requires conscious effort. Suppose I asked you to spend three minutes thinking of alternative uses of for the common brick. No doubt, you would come up with some, but my hunch is not very many. The average adult comes up with three to six ideas. However, if I asked you to list 40 uses for the brick as fast as you can you would have quite a few in a short period of time.\n“Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration”\nA specific quota focuses your energy in a competitive way that guarantees fluency and flexibility of thought. To meet the quota, you find yourself listing all the usual uses for a brick (build a wall, fireplace, outdoor barbeque, and so on) as well as listing everything that comes to mind (anchor, projectiles in riots, ballast, device to hold down newspaper, a tool for leveling dirt, material for sculptures, doorstop and so on) as we stretch our imagination to meet the quota. By causing us to exert effort, it allows us to generate more imaginative alternatives than we otherwise would.\nInitial ideas are usually poorer in quality than later ideas. Just as water must run from a faucet for a while to be crystal- clear, cool and free of particles, so thought must flow before it becomes creative. Early ideas are usually not true ideas. Exactly why this is so is not known, but one hypothesis is that familiar and safe responses lie closest to the surface of our consciousness and therefore are naturally thought of first. Creative thinking depends on continuing the flow of ideas long enough to purge the common, habitual ones and produce the unusual and imaginative.\nTo prove this to yourself, try the following exercise. Following is a list of five words. Write the first association that occurs to you for each word. Now do this five more times as illustrated with the first word and for each time write an association that is different from the association you gave the same word on the previous occasions.\nFish, Ocean, Marlin, Football, Crowds, Money\nMilitary\nGovernment\nAutomobile\nYou will note that the latter associations are much more original and unique than the earlier ones. The first responses are the common, dominant associations you have for that word. By arranging to give responses that are not common or dominant, there is an increase in originality and imaginativeness of the responses.\nA way to guarantee productivity of your creative thought is to give yourself an idea quota. For example, an idea quota of 40 ideas if you’re looking for ideas alone or a quota 120 ideas if a group is brainstorming for ideas. By forcing yourself to come up with 40 ideas, you put your internal critic on hold and write everything down, including the obvious and weak. The first third will be the same-old, same-old ideas you always get. The second third will be more interesting and the last third will show more insight, curiosity and complexity.\n2. CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS\nEdison felt his lack of formal education was, in fact, “his blessing.” This enabled him to approach his work of invention with far fewer assumptions than his more educated competitors, which included many theoretical scientists, renowned Ph.D.s, and engineers. He approached any idea or experience with wild enthusiasm and would try anything out of the ordinary, including even making phonograph needles out of compressed rainforest nuts and clamping his teeth onto a phonograph horn to use as a hearing aid, feeling the sound vibrate through his jaw. This wild enthusiasm inspired him to consistently challenge assumptions.\nHe felt that in some ways too much education corrupted people by prompting them to make so many assumptions that they were unable to see many of nature’s great possibilities. When Edison created a “system” of practical lighting, he conceived of wiring his circuits in parallel and of using high-resistance filaments in his bulbs, two things that were not considered possible by scientific experts, in fact, were not considered at all because they were assumed to be totally incompatible until Edison put them together.\nBefore Edison hired a research assistant, he would invite the candidate over for a bowl of soup. If the person seasoned the soup before tasting it, Edison would not hire the candidate. He did not want people who had so many built-in assumptions into their everyday life, that they would even assume the soup is not properly seasoned. He wanted people who consistently challenged assumptions and tried different things.\n3. NOTHING IS WASTED\nWhen an experiment failed, Edison would always ask what the failure revealed and would enthusiastically record what he had learned. His notebooks contain pages of material on what he learned from his abortive ideas, including his many experiments on will power (he conducted countless experiments with rubber tubes extended from his forehead trying to will the physical movement of a pendulum). Once when an assistant asked why he continued to persist trying to discover a long-lasting filament for the light bulb after failing thousands of times, Edison explained that he didn’t understand the question. In his mind he hadn’t failed once. Instead, he said he discovered thousands of things that didn’t work. Finally, he completed Patent 251,539 for the light bulb that ensured his fame and fortune.\nBefore Edison hired a research assistant, he would invite the candidate over for a bowl of soup. If the person seasoned the soup before tasting it, Edison would not hire the candidate. He did not want people who had so many built-in assumptions into their everyday life, that they would even assume the soup is not properly seasoned.\nHe had an enormous talent for appropriating ideas that may have failed in one instance and using them for something else. For example, when it became clear in 1900 that an iron-ore mining venture in which Edison was financially committed was failing and on the brink of bankruptcy, he spent a weekend studying the company’s resources and came up with a detailed plan to redirect the company’s efforts toward the manufacture of Portland cement, which could capitalize on the same equipment, materials and distribution systems of the iron-ore company.\nEdison relentlessly recorded and illustrated every problem worked on in his notebooks. Whenever he succeeded with a new idea, Edison would review his notebooks to rethink ideas and inventions he’s abandoned in the past in the light of what he’d recently learned. If he was mentally blocked working on a new idea, he would review his notebooks to see if there was some thought or insight that could trigger a new approach. For example, Edison’s unsuccessful work to develop an undersea telegraph cable ultimately led to a breakthrough on a telephone transmitter. He took the principle for the unsuccessful undersea telegraph cable— variable resistence— and incorporated it into the design of a telephone transmitter that adapted to the changing sound waves of the caller’s voice. This technique instantly became the industry standard.\nEdison would often jot down his observations of the natural world, failed patents and research papers written by other inventors, and ideas others had come up with in other fields. He would also routinely comb a wide variety of diverse publications for novel ideas that sparked his interest and record them in his notebooks. He advised his assistants to make it a habit to keep on the lookout for novel and interesting ideas that others have used successfully on other problems in other fields. To Edison, your idea needs to be original only in its adaptation to the problem you are working on.\nEdison’s lesson is to record your ideas and other novel ideas in a notebook— call it “The Bright Ideas Notebook.” When confronted with a problem, review your notebook and look for ways to cross-fertilize ideas, techniques and conceptual models by transferring them from one problem to the next.\n4. CONSTANTLY IMPROVE YOUR IDEAS AND PRODUCTS AND THE IDEAS AND PRODUCTS OF OTHERS\nContrary to popular belief, Edison did not invent the light bulb: his genius, rather, was to perfect the bulb as a consumer item. Edison also studied all his inventions and ideas as springboards for other inventions and ideas in their own right. To Edison, the telephone (sounds transmitted) suggested the phonograph (sounds recorded), which suggested motion pictures (images recorded). Simple, in retrospect, isn’t it? Genius usually is.\nEinstein believed that every new idea is some addition or modification to something that already exists. You take a subject and manipulate or change it into something else. There are nine principle ways you can manipulate a subject. These ways were first formally suggested by Alex Osborn, the father of brainstorming, and later arranged by Bob Eberle into the mnemonic SCAMPER.\nS = Substitute?\nP = Put to other uses?\nE = Eliminate?\nR = Rearrange? = Reverse?\nYou isolate the subject you want to think about and ask the checklist of SCAMPER questions to see what new ideas and thoughts emerge. Think about any subject from improving the ordinary paperclip to reorganizing your corporation and apply the “Scamper” checklist of questions.\nYou’ll find that ideas start popping up almost involuntarily, as you ask:\nCan you substitute something?\nCan you combine your subject with something else?\nCan you adapt something to your subject?\nCan you magnify or add to it?\nCan you modify or change it in some fashion?\nCan you put it to some other use?\nCan you eliminate something from it?\nCan you rearrange it?\nWhat happens when you reverse it?\nEdison was tireless in his persistence to change a subject into something else through “trial and error” until he found the idea that worked. In Edison’s laboratory there is a staggering display of hundreds of phonograph horns of every shape, size and material. Some are round, square, angular, thin, short, squat while others are curved and as long as six feet tall. This collection of rejected ideas is a visual testament to Edison’s approach to creativity— which was, in essence, to try out every possible design he could possibly conceive of. Once asked to describe the key to creativity, he reportedly said to never quit working on your subject until you get what you’re after.\nJust Start acting Creative\nFinally, if you want to become more creative, start acting like you are creative. Suppose that you wanted to be an artist: You would begin behaving like an artist by painting every day. You may not become another Vincent Van Gogh, but you’ll become more of an artist than someone who has never tried. Similarly, to increase your creativity start acting like Thomas Edison.\nCultivate the following creative-thinking habits:\n• When looking for ideas, create lots of ideas.\n• Consistently challenge assumptions.\n• Record your ideas and the ideas of others in a notebook.\n• Learn from your failures and the failures of others.\n• Constantly look for ways to improve your ideas and products and the ideas and products of others.\nYou may not become the next Thomas Edison but you’ll become much more creative than someone who has never tried.\nOnce asked to describe the key to creativity, he said, never quit working on your subject until you get what you’re after.",

His first patent application was executed while he was 21 years old on October 13, 1868. Edison's U.S. patents can be grouped into the general categories of electric power and light, phonographs and sound recording, telegraphy and telephony, batteries, mining and ore milling, miscellany, cement and motion pictures.\nFull Answer\nEdison's career as an inventor began in Newark, New Jersey, with his successful development of improved telegraph devices. It was his 1877 invention of the phonograph, however, that brought him to attention. The public reaction to displays of Edison's invention was unprecedented. The Washington Post described a display of the new device presented by Edison to Congress and the U.S. President in 1878 as a scene \"that will live in history.\" Edison soon became a celebrity and gained the nickname \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\" after the section of Middlesex County, New Jersey where he had set-up his laboratory. The area has since been renamed Edison Township in honor of the famous inventor.\nEdison is also known for his invention of the first commercially practical light bulb and his development of one of the first systems for the distribution of electric power. He established the first electric public utility company in New York City and began supplying DC power to 59 lower Manhattan customers in 1882. By 1887, Edison had 121 power stations in operation, but his DC systems were eventually replaced by the AC power distribution method championed by his adversary George Westinghouse. Edison also attempted to develop a practical X-ray device, or fluoroscope, but dropped the project after his assistant was severely injured by radiation exposure.",

Today we live in a world that would not have been possible if not for several of his important inventions – the electric light bulb, the motion picture camera, electric power distribution, the phonograph, and a host of other things that we take for granted today. In fact, he still holds the world record for the maximum number of patents, numbering 1093 in all!  Edison – His Life and Inventions by Frank Lewis Dyer and Thomas Commerford Martin, published in 1910 was in fact a biography commissioned by Edison himself. Dyer was a patent attorney who worked for Edison, while Commerford was a technical magazine editor who published many of Edison's papers. There is consequently a great deal of focus on the technical aspects of his inventions and not so much on his personality and nature. However, as a chronological account of his life, the biography does full justice to its title.  This brilliant scientist, businessman and inventor had in fact, practically no formal education. He actually went to school only for three months in his life. His mother provided support and motivation for the hearing-impaired child, who taught himself to read and discovered his love for science by reading books like Parker's The School of Natural Philosophy, etc.  A notable feature of the book is that it was written in Edison's own lifetime and hence captures the feel of being very contemporary. There are many anecdotes and stories which the great man himself has contributed or has directly conveyed to the authors, hence the flavor is very authentic and realistic and conveys the excitement and thrill of the life and times of this master inventor.  A great inspiration for all ages!",

In this era of information and lightning searches — when patents are both more valuable than ever and a source of raging controversy — you'd think such a simple question would be easy to answer.\nThe top patent-holder at IBM is a researcher Ravi Arimilli, based in Austin, who specializes in computer chips.\nIBM\nYou'd think somebody could push a button and get a list. But, uh, no.\nAmerica cannot identify its most prolific living inventors. We can't single out these people who should be considered national treasures.  (Related item: Kevin Maney's blog )\nI found this out because I wanted to interview the top 10 living patent holders for a story. I got in touch with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and asked for a list, thinking it was about the same as calling Billboard and asking for the top 10 songs.\nAs it turns out, the USPTO has but one guy who does statistical studies of the agency's 7 million-patent database. He last sorted for individual inventors in 1997, and has since been too busy with other projects to update that list.\nI asked for help from a few commercial companies that do patent database searches. Thomson gave it a college try and for a while had a team working on my question. Others just said it couldn't be done. The question, with variables including inventors with same last names and multiple names on patents, is apparently a database operator's nightmare.\n\"The last five years include some 1 million granted U.S. patents,\" Thomson's Ryan Sheppard e-mailed me, explaining why Thomson couldn't pull it off, either. \"Ten years of data would be roughly double that. So we are talking astonishingly large numbers of documents.\"\nAnyone can go to the USPTO's website, type in an individual's name, and get a list of all the patents granted that person. But you have to start with a name. You can't set up an open-ended search that finds the names that appear most often. There's no easy way to let the database generate a list of top inventors.\nSince the question can't be officially answered, I thought I'd hack at it in other ways. It's possible to use a variety of resources to tease out a few names who would likely make the top 10 list of living inventors. And that leads to some pretty wild surprises.\nFor more than 50 years, Thomas Edison has been considered the nation's all-time most prolific inventor. He has 1,093 patents to his name, including the electric light bulb and phonograph. He is to American innovation what Thomas Jefferson is to American politics.\nHowever, Edison is apparently NOT the top American inventor. He has been bested by Donald Weder of Highland, Ill. — a man who, in contrast to the stupendous impact of Edison, has mostly used his inventive powers to give the world better floral arrangements.\nThis is as deflating as finding out that Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak has been surpassed by a stadium peanut vendor.\nWeder, who is still alive and whose family runs floral packaging company Highland Supply, has his name on 1,321 patents. Almost all have to do with items you'd find at a florist. Weder's most recent patent — No. 6,962,021, granted Nov. 8 — is for a sleeve for holding a group of flowers. Before that, on Oct. 11, Weder was issued a patent titled, \"Method of covering a flower pot.\" On Sept. 20, he was issued a patent titled, \"Method of covering a flower pot or floral grouping.\"\nMuch of Weder's list goes on in a similar fashion. (Weder didn't return phone messages.)\nAside from Weder, who else would make the list of most prolific living inventors?\nWhile the patent office doesn't keep a list of top individual inventors, it does track which companies get the most patents. For the past decade, IBM has been first on that list every year. I figured the top patent holder at the top patent-holding company would be a good bet.\nRavi Arimilli is IBM's top patent holder, with more than 300 patents. He's a researcher, based in Austin, who specializes in computer chip innards. Arimilli's most recent patent, issued Nov. 29, is for \"Layered local cache with lower level cache optimizing allocation mechanism.\" He must be great at cocktail parties.\nIn 2002 alone, Arimilli won 78 patents. That's three patents every two weeks. Either he's a wonder-dude who makes the rest of us look like slugs, or his name winds up on a lot of work done by teams of people.\nEither way, at only 42, he'll probably continue to climb up the patent-holding ranks.\nIn the search for prolific inventors, here's the biggest shock: The all-time champion of U.S. patents might be a foreigner.\nWhen the USPTO made that 1997 list of living prolific inventors, the No. 1 patent holder was Shunpei Yamazaki. Most of his work involves computer and video screens for his Tokyo company, Semiconductor Energy Laboratory. As of 1997, Yamazaki held 372 patents.\nToday, a search of the USPTO database turns up 1,432 patents bearing his name, whupping both Edison and Weder. Yamazaki's most recent patent, granted Nov. 22, was titled, \"Reflective liquid crystal display panel and device using same.\" His first patent, for a computer chip design, was granted in 1980. Yamazaki has averaged about a patent a week for 25 years.\nIt doesn't seem unusual to have a foreigner holding so many patents. Of the top 10 living patent holders on the 1997 list, eight were from other countries. Six were Germans, and two were Japanese. The only two Americans were flower guy Weder and oil industry researcher Hartley Owen.\nSo much for the legend of Edison. America's greatest inventor is apparently an obscure guy in Japan who makes stuff most people can't comprehend. And the nation's greatest native inventor seems to be a man who has come up with 100 different ways to make a flower pot.\nKevin Maney has covered technology for USA TODAY since 1985.

                "New Zealand () is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmasses – that of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu – and numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some 1500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1000 km south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.\n\nSometime between 1250 and 1300 CE, Polynesians settled in the islands that would later become New Zealand, and developed a distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer, became the first European to sight New Zealand.  In 1840, representatives of the British Crown and Māori Chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, making New Zealand a British colony. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 4.7 million is of European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, Māori and New Zealand Sign Language, with English predominant.\n\nNew Zealand is a developed country with a market economy. New Zealand is a World Bank high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom and quality of life. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently John Key. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a Governor-General. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.\n\nEtymology\n\nDutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and called it Staten Landt, supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America.  In 1645, Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland.   British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand.\n\nAotearoa (often translated as \"land of the long white cloud\") is the current Māori name for New Zealand. It is unknown whether Māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans, with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island. Māori had several traditional names for the two main islands, including Te Ika-a-Māui (the fish of Māui) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu (the waters of greenstone) or Te Waka o Aoraki (the canoe of Aoraki) for the South Island. Early European maps labelled the islands North (North Island), Middle (South Island) and South (Stewart Island / Rakiura).  In 1830, maps began to use North and South to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907, this was the accepted norm.  The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013.  This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui, and South Island or Te Waipounamu.  Note that for each island, either its English or Māori name can be used, or both can be used together.\n\nHistory\n\nNew Zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans. Radiocarbon dating, evidence of deforestation  and mitochondrial DNA variability within Māori populations  suggest New Zealand was first settled by Eastern Polynesians between 1250 and 1300,  concluding a long series of voyages through the southern Pacific islands.  Over the centuries that followed, these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as Māori. The population was divided into iwi (tribes) and hapū (subtribes) who would sometimes cooperate, sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other. At some point, a group of Māori migrated to the Chatham Islands (which they named Rēkohu) where they developed their distinct Moriori culture.   The Moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862, largely because of Taranaki Māori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s, although European diseases also contributed. In 1862, only 101 survived and the last known full-blooded Moriori died in 1933. \n\nThe first Europeans known to have reached New Zealand were Dutch explorer Abel Tasman and his crew in 1642. In a hostile encounter, four crew members were killed and at least one Māori was hit by canister shot.  Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769 when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline. Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing and trading ships. They traded European food, metal tools, weapons and other goods for timber, Māori food, artifacts and water. The introduction of the potato and the musket transformed Māori agriculture and warfare. Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus, which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns.  The resulting intertribal Musket Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840, killing 30,000–40,000 Māori.  From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand, eventually converting most of the Māori population.  The Māori population declined to around 40 percent of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor. \n\nIn 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip assumed the position of Governor of the new British colony of New South Wales which according to his commission included New Zealand.  The British Government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern Māori. In 1835, following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry, the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of the Independence to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection. Ongoing unrest, the proposed settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company (which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from Māori) and the dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for Great Britain and negotiate a treaty with the Māori.  The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840. In response to the New Zealand Company's attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington  and French settlers purchasing land in Akaroa,  Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840, even though copies of the Treaty were still circulating throughout the country for Māori to sign.  With the signing of the Treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants, particularly from the United Kingdom, began to increase. \n\nNew Zealand, still part of the colony of New South Wales, became a separate Colony of New Zealand on 1 July 1841.  The colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first Parliament met in 1854. In 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing, gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy. (Control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s.) Following concerns that the South Island might form a separate colony, premier Alfred Domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from Auckland to a locality near the Cook Strait.  Wellington was chosen for its harbour and central location, with parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865. As immigrant numbers increased, conflicts over land led to the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s and 1870s, resulting in the loss and confiscation of much Māori land. \n\nIn 1891 the Liberal Party led by John Ballance came to power as the first organised political party. The Liberal Government, later led by Richard Seddon, passed many important social and economic measures. In 1893 New Zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote  and in 1894 pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions.  In 1898 Seddon's government passed the Old-age Pensions Act of 1898, the first general pensions scheme in the British Empire.\n\nIn 1907, at the request of the New Zealand Parliament, King Edward VII proclaimed New Zealand a dominion within the British Empire, reflecting its self-governing status. Accordingly, the title \"Dominion of New Zealand\" dates from 1907.  \n\nIn 1947 the country adopted the Statute of Westminster, confirming that the British parliament could no longer legislate for New Zealand without the consent of New Zealand. New Zealand was involved in world affairs, fighting, as part of the British Empire, in the First and Second World Wars  and suffering through the Great Depression.  The depression led to the election of the first Labour government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy.  New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following World War II  and Māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work.  A Māori protest movement developed, which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and the Treaty of Waitangi.  In 1975, a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985. The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi, although Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s.\n\nPolitics\n\nGovernment\n\nNew Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy,  although its constitution is not codified.  Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand and the head of state.  The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister.   The Governor-General can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public officials,  and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent of a bill into law).  The powers of the Queen and the Governor-General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of Cabinet. \n\nThe New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the Queen and the House of Representatives. It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950. The supremacy of Parliament, over the Crown and other government institutions, was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand. The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a Government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats. If no majority is formed a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured. The Governor-General appoints ministers under advice from the Prime Minister,  who is by convention the Parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition. Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the Prime Minister, is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions.  By convention, members of cabinet are bound by collective responsibility to decisions made by cabinet. \n\nAlmost all parliamentary general elections between  and  were held under the first-past-the-post voting system. The elections since 1930 have been dominated by two political parties, National and Labour. Since the , a form of proportional representation called Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) has been used. Under the MMP system each person has two votes; one is for electoral seats (including some reserved for Māori),  and the other is for a party. Since the , there have been 71 electorate seats (which includes 7 Māori electorates), and the remaining 49 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote, although a party has to win one electoral seat or 5 percent of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats.  Between March 2005 and August 2006 New Zealand became the only country in the world in which all the highest offices in the land (Head of State, Governor-General, Prime Minister, Speaker and Chief Justice) were occupied simultaneously by women. \n\nJudges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain constitutional independence from the government. This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions.  The Privy Council in London was the country's final court of appeal until 2004, when it was replaced with the newly established Supreme Court of New Zealand. The judiciary, headed by the Chief Justice,  includes the Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts.\n\nNew Zealand is identified as one of the world's most stable and well-governed nations.  , the country was ranked fifth in the strength of its democratic institutions  and first in government transparency and lack of corruption.  New Zealand has a high level of civic participation, with 79% voter turnout during the most recent elections, compared to an OECD average of 72%. Furthermore, 67% of New Zealanders say they trust their political institutions, far higher than the OECD average of 56%. \n\nForeign relations and the military\n\nEarly colonial New Zealand allowed the British Government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy.  The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate their own political treaties and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan. On 3 September 1939 New Zealand allied itself with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Savage proclaiming, \"Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we stand.\" \n\nIn 1951 the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European interests,  while New Zealand joined Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty.  The influence of the United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the Vietnam War,  the refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior,  disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and New Zealand's nuclear-free policy.   Despite the US's suspension of ANZUS obligations the treaty remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia, whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend.  Close political contact is maintained between the two countries, with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit, live and work in both countries without restrictions. In 2013, there are about 650,000 New Zealand citizens living in Australia, which is about 15 percent of the population of New Zealand.  65,000 Australians live in New Zealand.\n\nNew Zealand has a strong presence among the Pacific Island countries. A large proportion of New Zealand's aid goes to these countries and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment.  Permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category, which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year. A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8,000 Pacific Islanders were employed under it.  New Zealand is involved in the Pacific Islands Forum, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (including the East Asia Summit). New Zealand is also a member of the United Nations,  the Commonwealth of Nations,  the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  and the Five Power Defence Arrangements. \n\nThe New Zealand Defence Force has three branches: the Royal New Zealand Navy, the New Zealand Army and the Royal New Zealand Air Force.  New Zealand's national defence needs are modest because of the unlikelihood of direct attack,  although it does have a global presence. The country fought in both world wars, with notable campaigns in Gallipoli, Crete,  El Alamein  and Cassino.  The Gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand's national identity   and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia.  According to Mary Edmond-Paul, \"World War I had left scars on New Zealand society, with nearly 18,500 in total dying as a result of the war, more than 41,000 wounded, and others affected emotionally, out of an overseas fighting force of about 103,000 and a population of just over a million.\"  New Zealand also played key parts in the naval Battle of the River Plate  and the Battle of Britain air campaign.   During World War II, the United States had more than 400,000 American military personnel stationed in New Zealand.\n\nIn addition to Vietnam and the two world wars, New Zealand fought in the Korean War, the Second Boer War,  the Malayan Emergency,  the Gulf War and the Afghanistan War. It has contributed forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions, such as those in Cyprus, Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Sinai, Angola, Cambodia, the Iran–Iraq border, Bougainville, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands.  New Zealand also sent a unit of army engineers to help rebuild Iraqi infrastructure for one year during the Iraq War.\n\nNew Zealand ranks 8th in the Center for Global Development's 2012 Commitment to Development Index, which ranks the world's most developed countries on their dedication to policies that benefit poorer nations.  New Zealand is considered the fourth most peaceful country in the world according to the 2014 Global Peace Index. \n\nLocal government and external territories\n\nOfficially, New Zealand is divided into 16 regions.\n\nThe early European settlers divided New Zealand into provinces, which had a degree of autonomy.  Because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways, education, land sales and other policies, government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876.  As a result, New Zealand now has no separately represented subnational entities. The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays  and sporting rivalries. \n\nSince 1876, various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government.  In 1989, the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities. The 249 municipalities that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils. The regional councils' role is to regulate \"the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management\", while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage, water, local roads, building consents and other local matters.  Five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils.  The territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils, 53 district councils, and the Chatham Islands Council. While officially the Chatham Islands Council is not a unitary authority, it undertakes many functions of a regional council. \n\nNew Zealand is one of 16 realms within the Commonwealth.  The Realm of New Zealand is the territory over which the Queen of New Zealand is sovereign and comprises New Zealand, Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands and Niue. The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing states in free association with New Zealand.   The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries, but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence. Tokelau is a non-self-governing territory that uses the New Zealand flag and anthem, but is administered by a council of three elders (one from each Tokelauan atoll).   The Ross Dependency is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica, where it operates the Scott Base research facility.  New Zealand citizenship law treats all parts of the realm equally, so most people born in New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau and the Ross Dependency before 2006 are New Zealand citizens. Further conditions apply for those born from 2006 onwards. \n\nEnvironment\n\nGeography\n\nSee also: Atlas of New Zealand at Wikimedia Commons\n\nNew Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and a number of smaller islands. The two main islands (the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu) are separated by the Cook Strait, 22 km wide at its narrowest point.  Besides the North and South Islands, the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island, the Chatham Islands, Great Barrier Island (in the Hauraki Gulf),  d'Urville Island (in the Marlborough Sounds)  and Waiheke Island (about 22 km from central Auckland).  The country's islands lie between latitudes 29° and 53°S, and longitudes 165° and 179°E.\n\nNew Zealand is long and narrow (over 1600 km along its north-north-east axis with a maximum width of 400 km),  with about 15000 km of coastline and a total land area of 268000 km2.  Because of its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine resources. Its Exclusive Economic Zone is one of the largest in the world, covering more than 15 times its land area. \n\nThe South Island is the largest landmass of New Zealand, and is divided along its length by the Southern Alps.  There are 18 peaks over 3000 m, the highest of which is Aoraki / Mount Cook at 3754 m. Fiordland's steep mountains and deep fiords record the extensive ice age glaciation of this south-western corner of the South Island.  The North Island is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism.  The highly active Taupo Volcanic Zone has formed a large volcanic plateau, punctuated by the North Island's highest mountain, Mount Ruapehu (2797 m). The plateau also hosts the country's largest lake, Lake Taupo,  nestled in the caldera of one of the world's most active supervolcanoes. \n\nThe country owes its varied topography, and perhaps even its emergence above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates. New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent.  About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region. This is now most evident in the Southern Alps, formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault. Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other, producing the Puysegur Trench to the south, the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches  further north.\n\nNew Zealand and Australia are both part of the wider regions known as Australasia and Oceania. The term Oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing the Australian continent, New Zealand and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven-continent model.\n\nFile:NZ Landscape.jpg|Rural scene\nFile:Emerald Lakes, New Zealand.jpg|The Emerald Lakes, Mt Tongariro.\nFile:Lake Gunn.jpg|Lake Gunn\nFile:Pencarrow Head, Wellington, New Zealand from Santa Regina, 24 Feb. 2007.jpg|Pencarrow Head, Wellington\n\nClimate\n\nNew Zealand has a mild and temperate maritime climate (Köppen: Cfb) with mean annual temperatures ranging from 10 °C in the south to 16 °C in the north.  Historical maxima and minima are  in Rangiora, Canterbury and  in Ranfurly, Otago.  Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to almost semi-arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury and subtropical in Northland.  Of the seven largest cities, Christchurch is the driest, receiving on average only 640 mm of rain per year and Wellington the wettest, receiving almost twice that amount.  Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2,000 hours of sunshine. The southern and south-western parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate, with around 1,400–1,600 hours; the northern and north-eastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive about 2,400–2,500 hours.  The general snow season is about early June until early October in the South Island. Snowfall is less common on the North Island, although it does occur.\n\nFile:Autumn in New Zealand.jpg|Autumn in Wellington\nFile:New Zealand snow.jpg|Central Plateau in winter. Much of this region has a cool continental climate with regular snowfall.\nFile:Scorching Bay.jpg|Scorching Bay beach in summer\n\nThe table below lists climate normals for the warmest and coldest month in the six largest cities of New Zealand. The North Island cities are generally slightly warmer in February, but the South Island cities are warmest in January.\n\nBiodiversity\n\nNew Zealand's geographic isolation for 80 million years  and island biogeography has influenced evolution of the country's species of animals, fungi and plants. Physical isolation has not caused biological isolation, and this has resulted in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species.   About 82 percent of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family.   The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic, but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand and 40 percent of these are endemic.  The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps, or by southern beech in cooler climates.  The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are tussock. \n\nBefore the arrival of humans an estimated 80 percent of the land was covered in forest, with only high alpine, wet, infertile and volcanic areas without trees.  Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement.  Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement, being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming, leaving forest occupying only 23 percent of the land. \n\nThe forests were dominated by birds, and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi, kakapo, weka and takahē evolving flightlessness.  The arrival of humans, associated changes to habitat, and the introduction of rats, ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species, including large birds like the moa and Haast's eagle. \n\nOther indigenous animals are represented by reptiles (tuataras, skinks and geckos),  frogs, spiders (katipo), insects (weta) and snails.   Some, such as the wrens and tuatara, are so unique that they have been called living fossils. Three species of bats (one since extinct) were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique, mouse-sized land mammal at least 16 million years old.   Marine mammals however are abundant, with almost half the world's cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters.  Many seabirds breed in New Zealand, a third of them unique to the country.  More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any other country. \n\nSince human arrival almost half of the country's vertebrate species have become extinct, including at least fifty-one birds, three frogs, three lizards, one freshwater fish, and one bat. Others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced.  However, New Zealand conservationists have pioneered several methods to help threatened wildlife recover, including island sanctuaries, pest control, wildlife translocation, fostering, and ecological restoration of islands and other selected areas.     According to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, New Zealand is considered a \"strong performer\" in environmental protection, ranking 14th out of 132 assessed countries. \n\nEconomy\n\nNew Zealand has a modern, prosperous and developed market economy with an estimated gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita of roughly NZ$47,784.  The currency is the New Zealand dollar, informally known as the \"Kiwi dollar\"; it also circulates in the Cook Islands (see Cook Islands dollar), Niue, Tokelau, and the Pitcairn Islands.  New Zealand was ranked sixth in the 2013 Human Development Index,  fourth in The Heritage Foundation's 2012 Index of Economic Freedom,  and 13th in INSEAD's 2012 Global Innovation Index. \n\nHistorically, extractive industries have contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing at different times on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber.  With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in New Zealand.  High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s.  In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community  and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression.  Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank.  Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a highly protectionist economy to a liberalised free-trade economy.  \n\nUnemployment peaked above 10 percent in 1991 and 1992,  following the 1987 share market crash, but eventually fell to a record low of 3.4 percent in 2007 (ranking fifth from twenty-seven comparable OECD nations).  However, the global financial crisis that followed had a major impact on New Zealand, with the GDP shrinking for five consecutive quarters, the longest recession in over thirty years,   and unemployment rising back to 7 percent in late 2009.  At May 2012, the general unemployment rate was around 6.7 percent, while the unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 21 was 13.6 percent.  In the September 2014 quarter, unemployment was 5.4%.  New Zealand has experienced a series of \"brain drains\" since the 1970s  that still continue today.  Nearly one quarter of highly skilled workers live overseas, mostly in Australia and Britain, which is the largest proportion from any developed nation.  In recent years, however, a \"brain gain\" has brought in educated professionals from Europe and less developed countries. \n\nTrade\n\nNew Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade,  particularly in agricultural products.  Exports account for 24 percent of its output, making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns. Food products made up 55% of the value of all the country's exports in 2014; wood was the second largest earner (7%).  Its major export partners are Australia, United States, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom. On 7 April 2008, New Zealand and China signed the New Zealand–China Free Trade Agreement, the first such agreement China has signed with a developed country.   The service sector is the largest sector in the economy, followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction.  Tourism plays a significant role in New Zealand's economy, contributing $15.0 billion to New Zealand’s total GDP and supporting 9.6 percent of the total workforce in 2010.  International visitors to New Zealand increased by 3.1 percent in the year to October 2010  and are expected to increase at a rate of 2.5 percent annually up to 2015.\n\nIn 1984 New Zealand eliminated agricultural subsidies.   \n\nWool was New Zealand’s major agricultural export during the late 19th century. Even as late as the 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues, but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities  and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers.  In contrast dairy farming increased, with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007,  to become New Zealand's largest export earner.  In the year to June 2009, dairy products accounted for 21 percent ($9.1 billion) of total merchandise exports,  and the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade.  Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13.2 percent, wool 6.3 percent, fruit 3.5 percent and fishing 3.3 percent. New Zealand's wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy, the number of vineyards doubling over the same period,  overtaking wool exports for the first time in 2007.  \n\nInfrastructure\n\nIn 2014, renewable energy generated 39.5 percent of New Zealand's gross energy supply, primarily hydroelectric power and geothermal power. \n\nNew Zealand's transport network comprises 93805 km of roads, including 199 km of motorways,  and 4128 km of railway lines.  Most major cities and towns are linked by bus services, although the private car is the predominant mode of transport.  The railways were privatised in 1993, but were re-nationalised by the government in stages between 2004 and 2008. The state-owned enterprise KiwiRail now operates the railways, with the exception of Auckland commuter services which are operated by Transdev.  Railways run the length of the country, although most lines now carry freight rather than passengers.  Most international visitors arrive via air  and New Zealand has six international airports, but  only the Auckland and Christchurch airports connect directly with countries other than Australia or Fiji. \n\nThe New Zealand Post Office had a monopoly over telecommunications until 1987 when Telecom New Zealand was formed, initially as a state-owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990.  Telecom was rebranded as Spark New Zealand in 2014. Chorus, which was split from Telecom in 2011, still owns the majority of the telecommunications infrastructure, but competition from other providers has increased. The United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks New Zealand 12th in the development of information and communications infrastructure, having moved up four places between 2008 and 2010. \n\nWater supply and sanitation \n\nWater supply and sanitation in New Zealand is universal and of good quality in urban areas. It is provided by \nlocal government called Territorial Authorities in New Zealand. \nTerritorial Authorities consist of 14 city councils in urban areas and \n53 district councils in rural areas. The legal framework includes the \nHealth Act 1956  amended in 2007, the Local Government Act 2002 and the Resource Management Act 1991.\n\nDemography\n\nAs of June 2015, the population of New Zealand is estimated at 4.597 million.  New Zealand is a predominantly urban country, with 72 percent of the population living in 16 main urban areas and 53 percent living in the four largest cities of Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, and Hamilton.  New Zealand cities generally rank highly on international livability measures. For instance, in 2010 Auckland was ranked the world's 4th most liveable city and Wellington the 12th by the Mercer Quality of Life Survey. \n\nLife expectancy for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 years for females, and 80.2 years for males.  Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality is expected to decline. New Zealand's fertility rate of 2.1 is relatively high for a developed country, and natural births account for a significant proportion of population growth. Consequently, the country has a young population compared to most industrialized nations, with 20 percent of New Zealanders being 14 years old or younger. By 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3 million, the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18 percent to 29 percent. Despite the high life expectancy, mortality from heart disease is higher in New Zealand than it is in various other developed Western countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada. \n\nEthnicity and immigration\n\nIn the 2013 census, 74.0% of New Zealand residents identified ethnically as European, and 14.9% as Māori. Other major ethnic groups include Asian (11.8%) and Pacific peoples (7.4%), of which two-thirds live in the Auckland region. \nThe population has become more diverse in recent decades: in 1961, the census reported that the population of New Zealand was 92 percent European and 7 percent Māori, with Asian and Pacific minorities sharing the remaining 1 percent. \n\nWhile the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander, the informal \"Kiwi\" is commonly used both internationally  and by locals.  The Māori loanword Pākehā has been used to refer to New Zealanders of European descent, although others reject this appellation.   The word Pākehā today is increasingly used to refer to all non-Polynesian New Zealanders. \n\nThe Māori were the first people to reach New Zealand, followed by the early European settlers. Following colonisation, immigrants were predominantly from Britain, Ireland and Australia because of restrictive policies similar to the white Australian policies.  There was also significant Dutch, Dalmatian,  Italian, and German immigration, together with indirect European immigration through Australia, North America, South America and South Africa. Following the Great Depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased. In 2009–10, an annual target of 45,000–50,000 permanent residence approvals was set by the New Zealand Immigration Service—more than one new migrant for every 100 New Zealand residents.  Just over 25% of New Zealand's population was born overseas, with the majority (52%) living in the Auckland region. The United Kingdom remains the largest source of New Zealand's overseas population, with a quarter of all overseas-born New Zealanders born there; other major sources of New Zealand's overseas-born population are China, India, Australia, South Africa, Fiji and Samoa.  The number of fee-paying international students increased sharply in the late 1990s, with more than 20,000 studying in public tertiary institutions in 2002. \n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish is the predominant language in New Zealand, spoken by 98 percent of the population. New Zealand English is similar to Australian English and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart. The most prominent differences between the New Zealand English dialect and other English dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels: the short-\"i\" sound (as in \"kit\") has centralised towards the schwa sound (the \"a\" in \"comma\" and \"about\"); the short-\"e\" sound (as in \"dress\") has moved towards the short-\"i\" sound; and the short-\"a\" sound (as in \"trap\") has moved to the short-\"e\" sound.  Hence, the New Zealand pronunciation of words such as \"bad\", \"dead\", \"fish\" and \"chips\" sound like \"bed\", \"did\", \"fush\" and \"chups\" to non-New Zealanders.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Māori were discouraged from speaking their own language (te reo Māori) in schools and workplaces and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation,   being declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987, and is spoken by 4.1 percent of the population.  There are now Māori language immersion schools and two Māori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Māori.  Many places have both their Māori and English names officially recognised. Samoan is the most widely spoken non-official language in New Zealand (2.3 percent), followed by Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, French, and Yue Chinese (Cantonese).  New Zealand Sign Language is used by about 28,000 people. It was declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 2006. \n\nEducation\n\nPrimary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16, with the majority attending from the age of 5. There are 13 school years and attending state (public) schools is free to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents from a person's 5th birthday to the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday.  New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99 percent, and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification. There are five types of government-owned tertiary institutions: universities, colleges of education, polytechnics, specialist colleges, and wānanga, in addition to private training establishments.  In the adult population 14.2 percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4 percent have no formal qualification.  The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment ranks New Zealand's education system as the 7th best in the world, with students performing exceptionally well in reading, mathematics and science. \n\nReligion\n\nChristianity is the predominant religion in New Zealand, although its society is among the most secular in the world.  In the 2013 Census, 55.0 percent of the population identified with one or more religions, including 49.0 percent identifying as Christians. Another 41.9 percent indicated that they had no religion.  The main Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism (12.6 percent), Anglicanism (11.8 percent), Presbyterianism (8.5 percent) and \"Christian not further defined\" (i.e. people identifying as Christian but not stating the denomination, 5.5 percent). The Māori-based Ringatū and Rātana religions (1.4 percent) are also Christian.  Other significant minority religions include Hinduism (2.3 percent), Buddhism (1.5 percent) and Islam (1.2 percent). The indigenous Māori Christians tend to be associated with the Anglican and Catholic churches, while Pacific people tend to be Presbyterian, Methodist, Catholic and Latter-day Saint adherents.\n\nCulture\n\nEarly Māori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whanau), sub-tribes (hapu) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira) whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture,   particularly with the introduction of Christianity.  However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples.  More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.\n\nThe largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged, industrious problem solvers. Modesty was expected and enforced through the \"tall poppy syndrome\", where high achievers received harsh criticism. At the time New Zealand was not known as an intellectual country.  From the early 20th century until the late 1960s Māori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation of Māori into British New Zealanders.  In the 1960s, as higher education became more available and cities expanded  urban culture began to dominate.  Even though the majority of the population now lives in cities, much of New Zealand's art, literature, film and humour has rural themes.  From around the middle of the 20th century, many cultural icons called Kiwiana, started to emerge that now help to define what it means to be a New Zealander; such as the silver fern and the paua shell.\n\nArt\n\nAs part of the resurgence of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence.  Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head.  Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings.  The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs. \n\nMāori decorated the white wood of buildings, canoes and cenotaphs using red (a mixture of red ochre and shark fat) and black (made from soot) paint and painted pictures of birds, reptiles and other designs on cave walls.  Māori tattoos (moko) consisting of coloured soot mixed with gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel.  Since European arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes, originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of New Zealand.  Portraits of Māori were also common, with early painters often portraying them as \"noble savages\", exotic beauties or friendly natives. The country's isolation delayed the influence of European artistic trends allowing local artists to developed their own distinctive style of regionalism.  During the 1960s and 70s many artists combined traditional Māori and Western techniques, creating unique art forms.  New Zealand art and craft has gradually achieved an international audience, with exhibitions in the Venice Biennale in 2001 and the \"Paradise Now\" exhibition in New York in 2004. \n\nMāori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black, red and white triangles, diamonds and other geometric shapes.  Greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces, with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki, a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side.  Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand, and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions.  Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received a reputation for being casual, practical and lacklustre.  However, the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000, doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels, with some labels gaining international recognition. \n\nLiterature\n\nMāori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form.  Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and it was not until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known.  Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit.  Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished.  Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature. \n\nMedia and entertainment\n\nNew Zealand music has been influenced by blues, jazz, country, rock and roll and hip hop, with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation.  Māori developed traditional chants and songs from their ancient South-East Asian origins, and after centuries of isolation created a unique \"monotonous\" and \"doleful\" sound.  Flutes and trumpets were used as musical instruments  or as signalling devices during war or special occasions.  Early settlers brought over their ethnic music, with brass bands and choral music being popular, and musicians began touring New Zealand in the 1860s.   Pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century.  The New Zealand recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards and many New Zealand musicians have obtained success in Britain and the United States. Some artists release Māori language songs and the Māori tradition-based art of kapa haka (song and dance) has made a resurgence.  The New Zealand Music Awards are held annually by Recorded Music NZ; the awards were first held in 1965 by Reckitt & Colman as the Loxene Golden Disc awards.  Recorded Music NZ also publishes the country's official weekly record charts. \n\nRadio first arrived in New Zealand in 1922 and television in 1960.  The number of New Zealand films significantly increased during the 1970s. In 1978 the New Zealand Film Commission started assisting local film-makers and many films attained a world audience, some receiving international acknowledgement. The highest grossing New Zealand movies include: Hunt for the Wilderpeople, Boy, The World's Fastest Indian, Once Were Warriors, and Whale Rider.  Deregulation in the 1980s saw a sudden increase in the numbers of radio and television stations.  New Zealand television primarily broadcasts American and British programming, along with a large number of Australian and local shows. The country's diverse scenery and compact size, plus government incentives,  have encouraged some producers to film big budget movies in New Zealand, including Avatar, The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, The Chronicles of Narnia, King Kong and The Last Samurai.  The New Zealand media industry is dominated by a small number of companies, most of which are foreign-owned, although the state retains ownership of some television and radio stations. Between 2003 and 2008, Reporters Without Borders consistently ranked New Zealand's press freedom in the top twenty.  , New Zealand was ranked 13th worldwide in press freedom by Freedom House, with the 2nd freest media in the Asia-Pacific region after Palau. \n\nSports\n\nMost of the major sporting codes played in New Zealand have British origins.  Rugby union is considered the national sport  and attracts the most spectators. Golf, netball, tennis and cricket have the highest rates of adult participation, while netball, rugby union and football (soccer) is popular among young people. Around 54 percent of New Zealand adolescents participate in sports for their school.  Victorious rugby tours to Australia and the United Kingdom in the late 1880s and the early 1900s played an early role in instilling a national identity.  Horseracing was also a popular spectator sport and became part of the \"Rugby, Racing and Beer\" culture during the 1960s.  Māori participation in European sports was particularly evident in rugby and the country's team performs a haka, a traditional Māori challenge, before international matches. \n\nNew Zealand has competitive international teams in rugby union, netball, cricket, rugby league, and softball and has traditionally done well in triathlons, rowing, yachting and cycling. New Zealand participated at the Summer Olympics in 1908 and 1912 as a joint team with Australia, before first participating on its own in 1920. The country has ranked highly on a medals-to-population ratio at recent Games.   The All Blacks, the national men's rugby union team, are the most successful in the history of international rugby  and the reigning World Cup champions.  New Zealand is known for its extreme sports, adventure tourism and strong mountaineering tradition, as seen in the success of notable New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary.  Other outdoor pursuits such as cycling, fishing, swimming, running, tramping, canoeing, hunting, snowsports and surfing are also popular.  The Polynesian sport of waka ama racing has increased in popularity and is now an international sport involving teams from all over the Pacific. \n\nCuisine\n\nNew Zealand's cuisine has been described as Pacific Rim, drawing inspiration from Europe, Asia and Polynesia.  For dishes that have a distinctly New Zealand style, there's lamb, pork and cervena (venison), salmon, crayfish (lobster), Bluff oysters, whitebait, paua (abalone), mussels, scallops, pipis and tuatua (both are types of New Zealand shellfish), kumara (sweet potato), kiwifruit, tamarillo and pavlova, the national dessert. A Hāngi is a traditional New Zealand Māori method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven. New Zealand food's distinctiveness is more in the way New Zealanders eat, generally preferring as relaxed and unaffected as possible, in keeping with the laidback Kiwi psyche. New Zealand's climate is ideal for fine wine growing, wineries and vineyards.",
                "Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with  residents. It is located at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. Wellington is the world's southernmost capital city of a sovereign state.\n\nThe Wellington urban area comprises four cities: Wellington City, on the peninsula between Cook Strait and Wellington Harbour, contains the central business district and about half the population; Porirua on Porirua Harbour to the north is notable for its large Māori and Pacific Island communities; Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt are largely suburban areas to the northeast, together known as the Hutt Valley.\n\nAs the culture capital of New Zealand, Wellington is home to the National Archives, the National Art Gallery, the National Library, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, and numerous theatres. Wellington has many notable buildings including the Government Building, on Lambton Quay, which is one of the largest wooden buildings in the world.\n\nThe 2014 Mercer Quality of Living Survey ranked Wellington 12th in the world.  In 2011 Lonely Planet Best in Travel 2011 named Wellington as fourth in its Top 10 Cities to Visit in 2011, referring to it as the \"coolest little capital in the world\". \n\nEtymology\n\nWellington takes its name from Arthur Wellesley (1769–1852), the first Duke of Wellington and victor of the Battle of Waterloo (1815): his title comes from the town of Wellington in the English county of Somerset. It was named in November 1840 by the original settlers of the New Zealand Company on the suggestion of the directors of the same, in recognition of the Duke's strong support for the company's principles of colonisation and his \"strenuous and successful defence against its enemies of the measure for colonising South Australia\". One of the founders of the settlement, Edward Jerningham Wakefield, reported that the settlers \"took up the views of the directors with great cordiality and the new name was at once adopted\".Edward Jerningham Wakefield, \"Adventure in New Zealand\", Vol. 1, pub. John Murray, 1845.\n\nIn Māori, Wellington has three names. Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara refers to Wellington Harbour and means \"the great harbour of Tara\";   Pōneke is a transliteration of Port Nick, short for Port Nicholson (the city's central marae, the community supporting it and its kapa haka have the pseudo-tribal name of Ngāti Pōneke);  Te Upoko-o-te-Ika-a-Māui, meaning 'The Head of the Fish of Māui' (often shortened to Te Upoko-o-te-Ika), a traditional name for the southernmost part of the North Island, deriving from the legend of the fishing up of the island by the demi-god Māui.\n\nIn New Zealand Sign Language, the name is signed by raising the index, middle and ring fingers of one hand, palm forward, to form a \"W\", and shaking it slightly from side to side twice. \n\nThe city's location close to the mouth of the narrow Cook Strait leads to its vulnerability to strong gales, leading to the city's nickname of \"Windy Wellington\".\n\nHistory\n\nSettlement\n\nLegends recount that Kupe discovered and explored the district in about the 10th century. The earliest date with hard evidence for Maori living in New Zealand is about 1280.\nEuropean settlement began with the arrival of an advance party of the New Zealand Company on the ship Tory on 20 September 1839, followed by 150 settlers on the Aurora on 22 January 1840. The settlers constructed their first homes at Petone (which they called Britannia for a time) on the flat area at the mouth of the Hutt River. When that proved swampy and flood prone they transplanted the plans, which had been drawn without regard for the hilly terrain.\n\nNational capital\n\nIn 1865, Wellington became the capital city in place of Auckland, which William Hobson had made the capital in 1841. The Parliament of New Zealand had first met in Wellington on 7 July 1862, on a temporary basis; in November 1863, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Alfred Domett, placed a resolution before Parliament in Auckland that \"... it has become necessary that the seat of government ... should be transferred to some suitable locality in Cook Strait [region].\" Apparently there had been some concerns that the more populous South Island (where the goldfields were located) would choose to form a separate colony in the British Empire. Several Commissioners invited from Australia, chosen for their neutral status, declared that Wellington was a suitable location because of its central location in New Zealand and good harbour. Parliament officially met in Wellington for the first time on 26 July 1865. At that time, the population of Wellington was just 4,900.  Wellington's status as capital is by constitutional convention rather than statute. \n\nWellington is the location of the highest court, the Supreme Court of New Zealand, and the historic former High Court building has been enlarged and restored for its use. Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General, is in Newtown, opposite the Basin Reserve. Premier House, the official residence of the Prime Minister, is in Thorndon on Tinakori Road.\n\nImportance\n\nWellington is New Zealand's political centre, housing Parliament, the head offices of all Government Ministries and Departments and the bulk of the foreign diplomatic missions. It is an important centre of the film and theatre industry, and second to Auckland in terms of numbers of screen industry businesses.  Te Papa Tongarewa (the Museum of New Zealand), the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the Royal New Zealand Ballet, Museum of Wellington and the biennial New Zealand International Arts Festival are all sited there.\n\nWellington had the 12th best quality of living in the world in 2014, a ranking up from 13th place in 2012, according to a 2014 study by consulting company Mercer. Of cities in the Asia Pacific region, it ranked third (2014) behind Auckland and Sydney. It became much more affordable in terms of cost of living relative to cities worldwide, with its ranking moving from 93rd (more expensive) to 139th (less expensive) in 2009, probably as a result of currency fluctuations during the global economic downturn from March 2008 to March 2009.  \"Foreigners get more bang for their buck in Wellington, which is among the cheapest cities in the world to live\", according to a 2009 article, which reported that currency fluctuations make New Zealand cities affordable for multinational firms to do business: \"New Zealand cities were now more affordable for expatriates and were competitive places for overseas companies to develop business links and send employees\". \nLonely Planet named Wellington 'the coolest little capital in the world' in its 'Best in Travel 2011' guide book. It is home to Weta Workshop, associated with Peter Jackson, behind critically acclaimed films like The Lord of the Rings, King Kong, Avatar and The Hobbit. \n\nGeography\n\nWellington is at the south-western tip of the North Island on Cook Strait, separating the North and South Islands. On a clear day the snowcapped Kaikoura Ranges are visible to the south across the strait. To the north stretch the golden beaches of the Kapiti Coast. On the east the Rimutaka Range divides Wellington from the broad plains of the Wairarapa, a wine region of national notability. With a latitude of 41° 17' South, Wellington is the southernmost capital city in the world.  It is also the most remote capital city, the farthest away from any other capital. It is more densely populated than most other cities in New Zealand due to the restricted amount of land that is available between its harbour and the surrounding hills. It has very few open areas in which to expand, and this has brought about the development of the suburban towns. Because of its location in the Roaring Forties and its exposure to the winds blowing through Cook Strait, Wellington is known as \"Windy Wellington\". It is often called the world's windiest city, with an average wind speed of 27 km/h. \n\nWellington's scenic natural harbour and green hillsides adorned with tiered suburbs of colonial villas are popular with tourists. The CBD is close to Lambton Harbour, an arm of Wellington Harbour, which lies along an active geological fault, clearly evident on its straight western shore. The land to the west of this rises abruptly, meaning that many suburbs sit high above the centre of the city. There is a network of bush walks and reserves maintained by the Wellington City Council and local volunteers. These include Otari-Wilton's Bush, dedicated to the protection and propagation of native plants. The Wellington region has 500 km2 of regional parks and forests. In the east is the Miramar Peninsula, connected to the rest of the city by a low-lying isthmus at Rongotai, the site of Wellington International Airport.\n\nThe narrow entrance to the harbour is to the east of the Miramar Peninsula, and contains the dangerous shallows of Barrett Reef, where many ships have been wrecked (notably the inter-island ferry  in 1968).  The harbour has three islands: Matiu/Somes Island, Makaro/Ward Island and Mokopuna Island. Only Matiu/Somes Island is large enough for habitation. It has been used as a quarantine station for people and animals, and was an internment camp during World War I and World War II. It is a conservation island, providing refuge for endangered species, much like Kapiti Island farther up the coast. There is access during daylight hours by the Dominion Post Ferry.\n\nWellington is primarily surrounded by water, but some of near-by locations are listed below. \n\nSuburbs\n\nThe urban area stretches across the areas administered by the city councils of Wellington, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt and Porirua.\n\nClimate\n\nThe city averages 2,059 hours of sunshine per year. The climate is temperate marine, (Köppen: Cfb ) is generally moderate all year round, and rarely sees temperatures above 25 °C or below 4 °C. The hottest recorded temperature is , while  is the coldest. The city is notorious for its southerly blasts in winter, which may make the temperature feel much colder. It is generally very windy all year round with high rainfall; average annual rainfall is 1244 mm, June and July being the wettest months. Frosts are quite common in the hill suburbs and the Hutt Valley between May and September. Snow is very rare at low altitudes, although snow fell on the city and many other parts of the Wellington region during separate events in July and August 2011.  \n\nEarthquakes\n\nWellington suffered serious damage in a series of earthquakes in 1848  and from another earthquake in 1855. The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault to the north and east of Wellington. It was probably the most powerful earthquake in recorded New Zealand history,  with an estimated magnitude of at least 8.2 on the Moment magnitude scale. It caused vertical movements of two to three metres over a large area, including raising land out of the harbour and turning it into a tidal swamp. Much of this land was subsequently reclaimed and is now part of the central business district. For this reason the street named Lambton Quay is 100 to 200 metres (325 to 650 ft) from the harbour – plaques set into the footpath mark the shoreline in 1840, indicating the extent of reclamation.\n\nThe area has high seismic activity even by New Zealand standards, with a major fault line running through the centre of the city, and several others nearby. Several hundred minor fault lines have been identified within the urban area. Inhabitants, particularly in high-rise buildings, typically notice several earthquakes every year. For many years after the 1855 earthquake, the majority of buildings were made entirely from wood. The 1996-restored Government Buildings  near Parliament is the largest wooden building in the Southern Hemisphere. While masonry and structural steel have subsequently been used in building construction, especially for office buildings, timber framing remains the primary structural component of almost all residential construction. Residents place their confidence in good building regulations, which became more stringent in the 20th century.\n\nSince the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, earthquake readiness has become even more of an issue, with buildings declared by Wellington City Council to be earthquake-prone,   and the costs of meeting new standards.  \n\nEvery five years a year-long slow quake occurs beneath Wellington, stretching from Kapiti to the Marlborough Sounds. It was first measured in 2003, and reappeared in 2008 and 2013.  It releases as much energy as a magnitude 7 quake, but as it happens slowly there is no damage. During July 2013 there were many earthquakes, mostly in Cook Strait near Seddon.  On 21 July 2013 a magnitude 6.5 earthquake hit the city, but no tsunami report was confirmed nor any major damage.  On 16 August 2013 at 2:31 pm another earthquake struck, this time magnitude 6.6, but again no major damage occurred, though many buildings were evacuated.  On 20 January 2014 at 3:52 pm a rolling 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck the lower North Island 15 km east of Eketahuna and was felt in Wellington, but little damage was reported initially, except at Wellington Airport where one of the two giant eagle sculptures commemorating The Hobbit became detached from the ceiling. \n\nDemographics\n\nThe four cities comprising Wellington have a total population of   with the urban area containing 99% of that population. The remaining areas are largely mountainous and sparsely farmed or parkland and are outside the urban area boundary. More than most cities, life is dominated by its central business district (CBD). Approximately 62,000 people work in the CBD, only 4,000 fewer than work in Auckland's CBD, despite that city having four times the population.\n\nAnother major population area is the Kapiti Coast, situated north of Porirua and including the towns of Paraparaumu, Waikanae, Raumati and Otaki. The estimated population of the Kapiti Coast District as of June 2014 is .\n\nCounts from the 2013 census gave totals by area, gender, and age. Wellington City had the largest population of the four cities with 190,956  people, followed by Lower Hutt, Porirua and Upper Hutt. Women outnumbered men in all four areas. \n\nSource:\nStatistics New Zealand (2013 Census) \n\nAn increasing number of Wellingtonians profess no religious belief, with the most recent census in 2013 showing 44% in that category. The largest religious group was Christians at 39%. The latter figure represented a significant decline from seven years earlier at the previous census, when over 50% of the population identified as Christian.   \n\nAt the 2013 Census, just over 27% of Wellington's population was born overseas. The most common overseas birthplace is the United Kingdom, place of origin of 7.1% of the urban area's population. The next most-common countries of origin were Samoa (2.0%), India (1.8%), China (1.7%), Australia (1.6%), the Philippines (1.2%), South Africa (1.1%), Fiji (1.0%), the United States (0.8%) and Malaysia (0.6%).  \n\nAge distribution\n\nAge distributions for the four cities are given (see table below). The age structure closely matches the national distribution.\nThe relative lack of older people in Wellington is less marked when Kapiti Coast District is included – nearly 7% of Kapiti Coast residents are over 80.\n\nSource: Statistics New Zealand (2013 Census) \n\nArchitecture\n\nWellington showcases a variety of architectural styles from the past 150 years – 19th-century wooden cottages, such as the Italianate Katherine Mansfield Birthplace in Thorndon; streamlined Art Deco structures such as the old Wellington Free Ambulance headquarters, the Central Fire Station, Fountain Court Apartments, the City Gallery, and the former Post and Telegraph Building; and the curves and vibrant colours of post-modern architecture in the CBD.\n\nThe oldest building is the 1858 Colonial Cottage in Mount Cook.  The tallest building is the Majestic Centre on Willis Street at 116 metres high, the second tallest being the structural expressionist State Insurance Building at 103 metres. \nFor a full list see: List of tallest buildings in Wellington.\nFutuna Chapel in Karori was the first bicultural building in New Zealand, and is considered one of the most significant New Zealand buildings of the 20th century.\n\nOld St Paul's is an example of 19th-century Gothic Revival architecture adapted to colonial conditions and materials, as is St Mary of the Angels. Sacred Heart Cathedral is a Palladian Revival Basilica with the Portico of a Roman or Greek temple. The Museum of Wellington City & Sea in the Bond Store is in the Second French Empire style, and the Wellington Harbor Board Wharf Office Building is in a late English Classical style. There are several restored theatre buildings: the St James Theatre, the Opera House and the Embassy Theatre.\n\nCivic Square is surrounded by the Town Hall and council offices, the Michael Fowler Centre, the Wellington Central Library, Capital E (home of the National Theatre for Children), the City-to-Sea Bridge, and the City Gallery.\n\nAs it is the capital city, there are many notable government buildings. The Executive Wing of New Zealand Parliament Buildings, on the corner of Lambton Quay and Molesworth Street, was constructed between 1969 and 1981 and is commonly referred to as the Beehive. Across the road is the largest wooden building in the Southern Hemisphere,  part of the old Government Buildings which now houses part of Victoria University of Wellington's Law Faculty.\n\nThe Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa is on the waterfront.\n\nOther notable buildings include Wellington Town Hall, Wellington Railway Station, Dominion Museum (now Massey University), State Insurance Building, Westpac Stadium, and Wellington Airport at Rongotai. Leading architects include Frederick Thatcher, Frederick de Jersey Clere, W. Gray Young, Bill Alington, Ian Athfield, Roger Walker and Pynenburg and Collins.\n\nWellington contains many iconic sculptures and structures, such as the Bucket Fountain in Cuba Street and Invisible City by Anton Parsons on Lambton Quay. Kinetic sculptures have been commissioned, such as the Zephyrometer.  This 26-metre orange spike built for movement by artist Phil Price has been described as \"tall, soaring and elegantly simple\", which \"reflects the swaying of the yacht masts in the Evans Bay Marina behind it\" and \"moves like the needle on the dial of a nautical instrument, measuring the speed of the sea or wind or vessel.\" \n\nHousing and real estate\n\nWellington experienced a real estate boom in the early 2000s and the effects of the international property bust at the start of 2007. In 2005, the market was described as \"robust\".  By 2008, property values had declined by about 9.3% over a 12-month period, according to one estimate. More expensive properties declined more steeply, sometimes by as much as 20%.  \"From 2004 to early 2007, rental yields were eroded and positive cash flow property investments disappeared as house values climbed faster than rents. Then that trend reversed and yields slowly began improving,\" according to two New Zealand Herald reporters writing in May 2009.  In the middle of 2009 house prices had dropped, interest rates were low, and buy-to-let property investment was again looking attractive, particularly in the Lambton precinct, according to these two reporters.\n\nA Wellington City Council survey conducted in March 2009 found the typical central city apartment dweller was a New Zealand native aged 24 to 35 with a professional job in the downtown area, with household income higher than surrounding areas.  Three-quarters (73%) walked to work or university, 13% travelled by car, 6% by bus, 2% bicycled (although 31% own bicycles), and did not travel very far since 73% worked or studied in the central city. The large majority (88%) did not have children in their apartments; 39% were couples without children; 32% were single-person households; 15% were groups of people flatting together. Most (56%) owned their apartment; 42% rented (of renters, 16% paid NZ$351 to NZ$450 per week, 13% paid less and 15% paid more – only 3% paid more than NZ$651 per week). The report continued: \"The four most important reasons for living in an apartment were given as lifestyle and city living (23%), close to work (20%), close to shops and cafes (11%) and low maintenance (11%) ... City noise and noise from neighbours were the main turnoffs for apartment dwellers (27%), followed by a lack of outdoor space (17%), living close to neighbours (9%) and apartment size and a lack of storage space (8%).\" \n\nHouseholds are primarily one-family, making up 66.9% of households, followed by single-person households (24.7%); there were fewer multiperson households and even fewer households containing two or more families. These counts are from the 2013 census for the Wellington region (which includes the surrounding area in addition to the four cities). \n\nEconomy\n\nThe Government sector has long been a mainstay of the economy, which has typically risen and fallen with it. Traditionally, its central location meant it was the location of many head offices of various sectors – particularly finance, technology and heavy industry – many of which have since relocated to Auckland following economic deregulation and privatisation.  \n\nIn recent years, tourism, arts and culture, film, and ICT have played a bigger role in the economy. Wellington's median income is well above the average in New Zealand,  and the highest of all New Zealand cities.  It has a much higher proportion of people with tertiary qualifications than the national average.  Major companies with their headquarters in Wellington include:\n\nTourism\n\nTourism is a major contributor to the economy, injecting approximately NZ$1.3 billion into the region annually and accounting for 9% of total FTE employment.  The city is consistently named as New Zealanders' favourite destination in the quarterly FlyBuys Colmar Brunton Mood of the Traveller survey  and it was fourth in Lonely Planet Best in Travel 2011's Top 10 Cities to Visit in 2011. New Zealanders make up the largest visitor market, with 3.6 million visits each year. New Zealand visitors spend on average NZ$2.4 million a day.  There are approximately 540,000 international visitors each year, who spend 3.7 million nights and NZ$436 million. The largest international visitor market is Australia, with over 210,000 visitors spending approximately NZ$334 million annually. \n\nWellington is marketed as the 'coolest little capital in the world' by Positively Wellington Tourism, an award-winning regional tourism organisation  set up as a council controlled organisation by Wellington City Council in 1997.  The organisation's council funding comes through the Downtown Levy commercial rate.  In the decade to 2010, the city saw growth of over 60% in commercial guest nights. It has been promoted through a variety of campaigns and taglines, starting with the iconic Absolutely Positively Wellington advertisements.  The long-term domestic marketing strategy was a finalist in the 2011 CAANZ Media Awards. \n\nPopular tourist attractions include Museum of Wellington City & Sea, Wellington Zoo, Zealandia and Wellington Cable Car. Cruise tourism is experiencing a major boom in line with nationwide development. The 2010/11 season saw 125,000 passengers and crew visit on 60 liners. There were 80 vessels booked for visits in the 2011/12 season – estimated to inject more than NZ$31 million into the economy and representing a 74% increase in the space of two years. \n\nWellington is a popular conference tourism destination due to its compact nature, cultural attractions, award-winning restaurants and access to government agencies. In the year ending March 2011, there were 6495 conference events involving nearly 800,000 delegate days; this injected approximately NZ$100 million into the economy. \n\nArts and culture\n\nMuseums and cultural institutions\n\nWellington is home to Te Papa (the Museum of New Zealand), the National Library of New Zealand, Archives New Zealand, Wellington Museum, the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace Museum, Colonial Cottage, the New Zealand Cricket Museum, the Cable Car Museum, the Reserve Bank Museum, Old St Paul's, and the Wellington City Art Gallery.\n\nFestivals\n\nWellington is home to many high-profile events and cultural celebrations, including the biennial New Zealand International Arts Festival, biennial Wellington Jazz Festival, biennial Capital E National Arts Festival for Children and major events such as Brancott Estate World of Wearable Art, Cuba Street Carnival, Visa Wellington on a Plate, New Zealand Fringe Festival, New Zealand International Comedy Festival (also hosted in Auckland), Summer City, The Wellington Folk Festival (in Wainuiomata), New Zealand Affordable Art Show, the New Zealand Sevens Weekend and Parade, Out In The Square, Vodafone Homegrown, the Couch Soup theatre festival, Camp A Low Hum and numerous film festivals.\n\nThe annual children's Artsplash Festival brings together hundreds of students from across the region. The week-long festival includes music and dance performances and the presentation of visual arts.\n\nFilm\n\nFilmmakers Sir Peter Jackson, Sir Richard Taylor and a growing team of creative professionals have turned the eastern suburb of Miramar into a film-making, post-production and special effects infrastructure centre, giving rise to the moniker 'Wellywood'. Jackson's companies include Weta Workshop, Weta Digital, Camperdown Studios, post-production house Park Road Post, and Stone Street Studios near Wellington Airport. Recent films shot partly or wholly in Wellington include the Lord of The Rings trilogy, King Kong and Avatar. Jackson described Wellington: \"Well, it's windy. But it's actually a lovely place, where you're pretty much surrounded by water and the bay. The city itself is quite small, but the surrounding areas are very reminiscent of the hills up in northern California, like Marin County near San Francisco and the Bay Area climate and some of the architecture. Kind of a cross between that and Hawaii.\" \n\nSometime Wellington directors Jane Campion and Geoff Murphy have reached the world's screens with their independent spirit. Emerging Kiwi film-makers, like Robert Sarkies, Taika Waititi, Costa Botes and Jennifer Bush-Daumec,  are extending the Wellington-based lineage and cinematic scope. There are agencies to assist film-makers with tasks such as securing permits and scouting locations. \n\nWellington has a large number of independent cinemas, including The Embassy, Paramount,Penthouse, the Roxy and Light House, which participate in film festivals throughout the year. Wellington has one of the country's highest turn-outs for the annual New Zealand International Film Festival.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music scene has produced bands such as The Warratahs, The Mockers, The Phoenix Foundation, Shihad, Beastwars, Fly My Pretties, Rhian Sheehan, Birchville Cat Motel, Black Boned Angel, Fat Freddy's Drop, The Black Seeds, Fur Patrol, Flight of the Conchords, Connan Mockasin, Rhombus and Module, Weta, Demoniac. The New Zealand School of Music was established in 2005 through a merger of the conservatory and theory programmes at Massey University and Victoria University of Wellington. New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Nevine String Quartet and Chamber music New Zealand are based in Wellington. The city is also home to the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and the Internationally renowned men's A Cappella chorus Vocal FX.\n\nTheatre and the dramatic arts\n\nWellington is home to Downstage Theatre, BATS Theatre, Circa Theatre, the National Maori Theatre company Taki Rua, Whitireia Performance Centre, National Dance & Drama School Toi Whakaari and the National Theatre for Children at Capital E in Civic Square.\n\nWellington is home to groups that perform Improvised Theatre and Improvisational comedy, including Wellington Improvisation Troupe (WIT) an Improvisors and youth group, Joe Improv. Te Whaea National Dance & Drama Centre, houses New Zealand's University-level school of Dance and Drama, Toi Whakaari: NZ Drama School & New Zealand School of Dance, and Whitiriea Performing Arts Centre. These are separate entities that share the building's facilities.\n\nSt James' Theatre on Courtenay Place is a popular venue for artistic performances.\n\nDance\n\nWellington is the home for the Royal New Zealand Ballet, the New Zealand School of Dance and contemporary dance company Footnote.\n\nComedy\n\nMany of New Zealand's prominent comedians have either come from Wellington or got their start there, such as Ginette McDonald (\"Lyn of Tawa\"), Raybon Kan, Dai Henwood, Ben Hurley, Steve Wrigley, Guy Williams, the Flight of the Conchords and the satirist John Clarke (\"Fred Dagg\").\n\nThe comedy group Breaking the 5th Wall  operated out of Wellington and regularly did shows around the city, performing a mix of sketch comedy and semi-improvised theatre. In 2012 the group disbanded when some of its members moved to Australia.\n\nWellington is home to groups that perform improvised theatre and improvisational comedy, including Wellington Improvisation Troupe (WIT), The Improvisors and youth group Joe Improv.\n\nWellington hosts shows in the annual New Zealand International Comedy Festival. The NZ International Comedy Fest 2010 featured over 250 local and international comedy acts and was a first in incorporating an iPhone application for the Festival. \n\nVisual arts\n\nFrom 1936 to 1992 Wellington was home to the National Art Gallery of New Zealand, when it was amalgamated into Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Wellington is home to the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts and the Arts Foundation of New Zealand. The city's arts centre, Toi Poneke, is a nexus of creative projects, collaborations, and multi-disciplinary production. Arts Programmes and Services Manager Eric Vaughn Holowacz and a small team based in the Abel Smith Street facility have produced ambitious initiatives such as Opening Notes, Drive by Art, and public art projects. The city is home to experimental arts publication White Fungus. The Learning Connexion provides art classes. Other visual art galleries include the City Gallery.\n\nCuisine\n\nCafé culture is prominent.  Restaurants are either licensed to sell alcohol, BYO (bring your own), or unlicensed (no alcohol).  Restaurants offer cuisines including from Europe, Asia and Polynesia. \"For dishes that have a distinctly New Zealand style, there are lamb, pork and cervena (venison), salmon, crayfish (lobster), Bluff oysters, pāua (abalone), mussels, scallops, pipis and tuatua (both New Zealand shellfish); kumara (sweet potato); kiwifruit and tamarillo; and pavlova, the national dessert,\" recommends one tourism website. \n\nSport\n\nWellington is the home to:\n* The Hurricanes – Super Rugby team representing the Lower North Island, primarily based in Wellington\n* Wellington Lions – ITM Cup rugby team\n* Wellington Phoenix FC – football (soccer) club playing in the Australasian A-League, the only fully professional football club in New Zealand\n* Team Wellington – in the semi-professional New Zealand Football Championship\n* Central Pulse – netball team representing the Lower North Island in the ANZ Championship, primarily based in Wellington\n* Wellington Firebirds and Wellington Blaze – men's and women's cricket teams\n* Wellington Saints – basketball team in the National Basketball League\n\nSporting events include:\n* six pool games and two quarter-final games at the 2011 Rugby World Cup\n* the Wellington Sevens – a round of the IRB Sevens World Series held at the Westpac Stadium over several days every February.\n* the 2011 Tae Kwon Do World Champs\n* The 2014 World Field Target Championships\n* the World Mountain Running Championships in 2005\n* the Wellington 500 street race for touring cars, between 1985 and 1996\n* the McEvedy Shield – annual athletics meet for college students from Rongotai College, St Patrick's College (Silverstream), St Patrick's College (Wellington), and Wellington College\n\nEducation\n\nWellington offers a variety of college and university programs for students.\n\nVictoria University of Wellington has four campuses and works with a three-trimester system (beginning March, July, and November).  It enrolled 21,380 students in 2008; of these, 16,609 were full-time students. Of all students, 56% were female and 44% male. While the student body was primarily New Zealanders of European descent, 1,713 were Maori, 1,024 were Pacific students, 2,765 were international students. 5,751 degrees, diplomas and certificates were awarded. The university has 1,930 full-time employees. \n\nMassey University has a Wellington campus known as the \"creative campus\" and offers courses in communication and business, engineering and technology, health and well-being, and creative arts. Its school of design was established in 1886, and has research centres for studying public health, sleep, Maori health, small & medium enterprises, disasters, and tertiary teaching excellence.  It combined with Victoria University to create the New Zealand School of Music.\n\nThe University of Otago has a Wellington branch with its Wellington School of Medicine and Health.\n\nWhitireia New Zealand has large campuses in Porirua, Wellington and Kapiti; the Wellington Institute of Technology and New Zealand's National Drama school, Toi Whakaari. For further information, see List of universities in New Zealand. The Wellington area has numerous primary and secondary schools.\n\nTransport\n\nWellington is served by State Highway 1 in the west and State Highway 2 in the east, meeting at the Ngauranga Interchange north of the city centre, where SH 1 runs through the city to the airport. Road access into the capital is lower in grade than most other cities in New Zealand – between Wellington and the Kapiti Coast, SH 1 travels along the Centennial Highway, a narrow section of road, and between Wellington and Wairarapa SH 2 transverses the Rimutaka Ranges on a similar narrow accident-prone road. Wellington has two short motorways, both part of SH 1: the Johnsonville–Porirua Motorway and the Wellington Urban Motorway, which in combination with a small non-motorway section in the Ngauranga Gorge connect Porirua with Wellington city.\n\nBus transport in Wellington is supplied by several different operators under the banner of Metlink. Buses serve almost every part of Wellington city, with most of them running along the \"Golden Mile\" from Wellington Railway Station to Courtenay Place. Most of the buses run on diesel, but nine routes use trolleybuses – the only remaining public system in Oceania.\n\nWellington lies at the southern end of the North Island Main Trunk Railway (NIMT) and the Wairarapa Line, converging on Wellington Railway Station at the northern end of central Wellington. Two long-distance services leave from Wellington: the Capital Connection, for commuters from Palmerston North, and the Northern Explorer to Auckland.\n\nFour electrified suburban lines radiate from Wellington Railway Station to the outer suburbs – the Johnsonville Line through the hillside suburbs north of central Wellington; the Kapiti Line along the NIMT to Waikanae on the Kapiti Coast via Porirua and Paraparaumu; the Melling Line to Lower Hutt via Petone; and the Hutt Valley Line along the Wairarapa Line via Waterloo and Taita to Upper Hutt. A diesel-hauled carriage service, the Wairarapa Connection, connects several times daily to Masterton in the Wairarapa via the  long Rimutaka Tunnel. Combined, these five services carry 11.64 million passengers per year. \n\nWellington is the North Island port for Cook Strait ferries to Picton in the South Island, provided by state-owned Interislander and private Bluebridge. Local ferries connect Wellington city centre with Eastbourne, Seatoun and Petone.\n\nWellington International Airport is 6 km south-east of the city centre. It is serviced by flights from across New Zealand, Fiji and to Australia. Flights to other international destinations require a transfer at another airport, as larger aircraft cannot use Wellington's short (2081 m) runway, which has become an issue in recent years in regards to the Wellington region's economic performance.   The airport is the base for Wellington Aero Club, a private not-for-profit flight school.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nElectric power\n\nThe maximum electricity demand is forecast to grow on average by 1.4% annually over the next 15 years, from 756 MW in 2012 to 934 MW by 2027, slightly lower than the national average demand growth of 1.7% per annum. The largest source of generation in the region is Meridian Energy's West Wind wind farm, with a maximum output of 143 MW.  It is a few kilometres west of Wellington's central business district, on Quartz Hill and Terawhiti Station.  There are some other small generators in the region, but the total peak generation is only 165 MW. \n\nPeak demand greatly exceeds local generation, and power supply is highly dependent on the National Grid operated by Transpower.  Four 220 kV transmission circuits from Bunnythorpe, near Palmerston North, provide the main connections with the national grid.  The region is also supplied by the North Island terminal of the HVDC link at Haywards substation, on State Highway 58 above the Hutt Valley.  A major upgrade of the HVDC link commissioned in 2013 increased the capacity of the link from 700 MW to 1,000 MW from 2012, and 1,200 MW from 2014.\n\nThe local power distribution network is owned and managed by Wellington Electricity.\nThe main power supplies to the central business district come from Transpower grid exit point substations at Central Park and Wilton.  The Central Park substation is the largest grid exit point in the region, with a peak demand of over 170 MW (forecast to grow to 200 MW by 2020).  There are constraints and limitations with this substation, and alternative investment solutions are being developed to improve security of supply. \n\nStrong winds, advantageous for wind farms, have been known to damage power lines. In May 2009, one windstorm left about 2500 residents without power for several hours.  Lightning strikes and occasional faults in the electric power system sometimes cause power outages. \n\nWater \n\nWellington's first piped water supply came from a spring in 1867.  Greater Wellington Regional Council now supplies Lower Hutt, Porirua, Upper Hutt and Wellington with up to 220 million litres a day.  The water comes from Wainuiomata River (since 1884), Hutt River (1914), Orongorongo River (1926) and the Lower Hutt aquifer. \n\nGallery",
                "Wellington has been the Capital of New Zealand since 1865. New Zealand's first capital was Okiato or Old Russell in 1840-41. Auckland was the second capital from 1841 until 1865, when Parliament was permanently moved to Wellington after an argument that was had for one decade. As the members of parliament could not agree on the location of a more central capital, Wellington was decided on by three Australian commissioners.\n\nOkiato \n\nOkiato or Old Russell is a small holiday spot in the Bay of Islands, 7 km south of present-day Russell, which was then known as Kororareka. Okiato was New Zealand's first national capital, for a short time from 1840 to 1841, before the seat of government was moved to Auckland. William Hobson arrived in New Zealand on 29 January 1840, the date now celebrated as the Auckland Anniversary Day. On the following day, as Lieutenant-Governor he proclaimed British Sovereignty in New Zealand. 30 January 1840 was the day that the Union Jack was flown on the masthead of the Herald, the ship that brought Hobson to the Bay of islands, and that the flag was saluted by guns. A capital city needed to be decided on, and immediately after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840, Hobson sought advice from those who had been living in New Zealand for some time. The missionary Henry Williams recommended the area around the Waitemata Harbour. William Cornwallis Symonds agreed with that assessment. A week after the signing of the treaty, seven Māori chiefs from Orakei on the Waitemata Harbour came to see Hobson and invited him to stay amongst them. They wanted protection from a rival iwi, the Ngāpuhi, and offered him land in return for living there. On 21 February, a small party including Hobson, Williams, Symonds, Captain Joseph Nias, and Felton Mathew left on the Herald to explore the Waitemata; they arrived there two days later. They visited various places, but on 1 March, Hobson suffered a stroke which paralysed half of his body and affected his speech.  Rather than delegate the decision making to his officers, the party returned to the Bay of Islands with the task incomplete.\n\nMathew, who was Surveyor General, was then instructed to report on possible locations for a capital in the Bay of Islands. His initial recommendation was for Kororareka, but there were conflicting land claims and Hobson refused to accept this recommendation as he felt that he had insufficient authority to overcome those legal problems. His second recommendation was Captain James Reddy Clendon's property, as it met the requirements for a good anchorage and immediate availability of land suitable for subdivision and on-sale to settlers. Locations such as Paihia and Kerikeri were bypassed for various reasons. \n\nPomare, the local Māori chief in the 1830s, sold land at Okiato to a British merchant and ship owner, Captain Clendon on 7 December 1830 for £28 15s.  Clendon settled there in 1832 and set up a trading station with partner Samuel Stephenson. Clendon became the first United States Consul for New Zealand in 1838 or 1839. Clendon wanted £23,000 for the 380 acre of land, the house, two small cottages, a large store and other buildings. Hobson eventually agreed with Clendon on £15,000; the agreement was made on 22 March and Hobson took possession in May. Clendon had only been paid £1,000 when word was received that Governor George Gipps did not sanction the purchase. Clendon received a further £1,250 and a land grant of 10000 acre at Papakura.\n\nHobson changed its name from Okiato to Russell, in honour of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord John Russell. Hobson and his family moved there in May 1840 and officials, troops, workmen and immigrants took up residence in permanent or temporary buildings and tents. Mathew drew up ambitious plans for a town, but only one of the intended roads was ever built - leading directly from the town hall to the town jail. A year later Hobson moved the capital to Auckland and most of the Russell (i.e. Okiato) residents moved there too. A few officials lived on in the Government House at Russell but when it and the offices burned down in May 1842, they moved to Kororareka leaving Russell virtually deserted.\n\nKororareka was part of the Port of Russell and gradually became known as Russell also. In January 1844 Governor Robert FitzRoy officially designated Kororareka as part of the township of Russell. Now the name Russell applies only to the erstwhile Kororareka while Okiato has resumed its original name.\n\nAuckland \n\nThere is no doubt that Hobson regarded Russell as a temporary capital only. On 18 April 1840, he sent Mathew on a second journey south; the Surveyor General was instructed to explore the harbours of Whangarei, Mahurangi, and Waitemata, and to pay particular attention to a location on the southern shore of the Waitemata. Mathew spent two months exploring the various locations and rejected Whangarei and Mahurangi, but also rejected the site favoured by Hobson that later became known as Hobsonville. In his words, it was \"totally unfit for the site of the principal settlement, and indeed ill adapted for a settlement at all\". Mathew recommended the Panmure Basin for the settlement, which had numerous advantages, but he conceded that access from the harbour was difficult.\n\nOnce Hobson had regained some health, he went south to check Mathew's recommendations. On 6 July, he visited Panmure and immediately dismissed it over the difficult access by water. Hobson also admitted that his favoured location was impractical. After the party watched a sunset and were impressed by a \"lovely aspect of the shore further down the harbour in the golden glow of the late afternoon\", they went ashore there the following day. They agreed that the place held great promise for a future capital; it is believed that they landed at Shelly Beach in Ponsonby. By the end of the month, the decision was made that the capital would shift to the Waitemata.\n\nOn 13 September 1840, a barque left Russell for the Waitemata. On board were seven Government officials, some cabin passengers, and numerous steerage passenger. The party, under the command of Symonds, was to finalise the choice of the future capital, buy the land off the Maori, erect stores and accommodation buildings, and find a site for Government House. On 18 September, the land (some 3000 acre) had been chosen and an agreement signed with the land owners. A flagstaff was erected on Point Britomart, and Her Majesty's health was \"most rapturously drunk with cheers long and loud\". Sarah Mathews, the wife of the Surveyor General, recorded in her diary that the name \"Auckland\" was inscribed in the flag pole, together with the date of the land purchase. This may be regarded as the unofficial naming of the city, as the name was first put in writing by Hobson on 10 November of that year. George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland was First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1834, he had given a commission to William Hobson to sail for the East Indies on the Rattlesnake, which ended a six-year period without a command and on half pay. Whilst the name was bestowed in gratitude, it certainly met with general approval, as Lord Auckland was at the height of his fame in 1840 after he had been appointed Viceroy of India in 1835. Queen Victoria's approval of Auckland as the name for the settlement was published in the New Zealand Gazette on 26 November 1842.\n\nWork progressed well in Auckland. Hobson first visited Auckland on 17 October 1840 to check on progress, and decide on the location for Government House. He returned to the Bay of Islands, having decided to take up residence in Auckland in the following year. Government House was a kit set built in England and shipped out to New Zealand, weighing 250 t. It had 16 rooms, was 120 ft long, 50 ft wide, and 24 ft high. It was placed on the corner of Hobson and Cook Streets. The officials and all of government's papers were moved from the Bay of Islands to Auckland in January 1841. Hobson moved into his new residence on 14 March 1841, and with him moving in, the capital had shifted from the Bay of Islands to Auckland.\n\nThe first Supreme Court in New Zealand was built in 1842 on the corner of Queen Street and Victoria Street West. The court was presided over by Justice Martin.\n\nOn 23 June 1848, Government House burned down during Sir George Grey's tenure as Governor. Nobody came to harm but the building was a total loss.  A viceregal residence was then rented for many years (known as Scoria House and located on Karangahape Road) before the new Government House was built in 1856. Construction of this building was part of Auckland's campaign to retain the seat of government, as the discussion about the capital moving further south had already started.  This building formally became part of the University of Auckland in 1969, is now known as Old Government House, and was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I heritage structure in 1983. \n\nThe initial form of government was an executive council formed of public servant appointed by and responsible to the governor. This changed when the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that granted self-government to the Colony of New Zealand, was received. This allowed for a bicameral General Assembly (or Parliament), consisting of the Governor, an appointed Legislative Council and an elected House of Representatives, with an Executive Council nominally appointed by the Governor. It also allowed for provincial governments, and six provinces were initially established. The first general election was held in 1853 and Parliament convened in Auckland for its first session, which was opened on 27 May 1854. On 3 June, the question of the seat of Parliament was first discussed, with Edward Gibbon Wakefield arguing that the seat of government must be shifted to Wellington. Travel to and form parliament was arduous, and the members from the far south had taken two months to get to Auckland. A more central location was desirable, a move not supported by the members from Auckland constituencies.  What also did not help was that the General Assembly House had been erected in a hurry and was nothing more than a shell, and members called it the \"Shedifice\". The wind blew through the building, it leaked in the rain, and basic amenities like toilets were missing. Built on what was then the edge of town, it was a building without comforts. \n\nArguments over where Parliament should meet were had for a decade. James FitzGerald, who had briefly lead the country's first ministry, moved that the next session \"should be held in a more central position in the colony\". He had failed to consult with others beforehand, and many of the southern members were absent when the votes were cast, and the proposal was defeated 13 to 11. In 1856, a resolution that the next session should be held in Auckland was amended by substituting the phrase \"a more central position\" as the location, but the matter was left for the governor to decide. Only a few months later, a proposal for the next session to be convened in Nelson was narrowly defeated. The governor, Thomas Gore Browne, suggested that there could be merit in having alternating meetings in Wellington and Auckland. After much argument, it was decided to hold the second session of the 3rd Parliament was held in Wellington, and parliament met from July to September 1862 in the building of the Wellington Provincial Council.  A proposal to make this move to Wellington permanent was lost by a single vote. The Wellington Provincial Council buildings were built in 1858 and were opulent in style; the stark contrast to the \"Shedifice\" in Auckland was part of Wellington's campaign to entice members of parliament to move the capital to their city.\n\nAfter the capital had moved to Wellington, the Parliament Building was eventually transferred to the University of Auckland and demolished in 1919.  Government House remained one of the seats for the governor, who alternates between Wellington and Auckland to this day. Old Government House remained in this use until 1969, when Sir Frank and Lady Mappin donated the current Government House (Birchlands) that is located in Mount Eden. Old Government House has since been in use by the University of Auckland. \n\nWellington \n\nFollowing a motion in parliament by Alfred Domett, the 4th Premier, three Australian commissioners were tasked with deciding where the capital should move to. The motion asked for the governors of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania to appoint one representative of each of those Australian states. The appointees were Joseph Docker, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, Francis Murphy, the Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and Ronald Campbell Gunn, a former member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly and the Tasmanian Legislative Council.   Sir George Grey appointed the commissioners to fulfil the brief \"that the Seat of Government should be placed in a central position, that is to say, somewhere upon the shores of Cook's Straits.\" The commissioners inspected Wellington, Picton, Queen Charlotte Sound, the Tory Channel, Blenheim, Pelorus Sound, Havelock and Nelson. Their criteria were the central position in New Zealand that was asked for, access by water, land availability, resources in the surrounding country, defence considerations, and any natural disadvantages. The commissioners reported their findings in a simple two-page letter, where their main finding was summed up in a single sentence without further elaboration:\n\nThe move of the capital from Auckland to Wellington was undertaken in 1865, and Wellington has been New Zealand's capital since. The fifth session of the 3rd Parliament was opened on 26 July 1865 in Wellington, and this date is regarded as the move of the capital function to Wellington.  \n\n150th anniversary\n\nThe sesquicentennial anniversary of the capital moving to Wellington was celebrated on the weekend of 25 and 26 July 2015. A concert organised by Wellington City Council  was held in front of Parliament House and a light show depicting the history of Wellington projected onto the front of the building.  The main act was singer Dave Dobbyn, who was supported by Wellington's Orpheus Choir. The crowd was addressed by the Speaker of the House, David Carter, and the Mayor of Wellington, Celia Wade-Brown. Several national organisations, including the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the Royal New Zealand Ballet, and The NBR New Zealand Opera, offered free performances for the anniversary. Over 30 national institutions will open their collections to the public; this included the Supreme Court, the Reserve Bank, the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace, and the Premier House. \n\nNotes"

                "Capital city – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand\nCoolest little capital\n\nThe capital city is the location of a country’s major government institutions. New Zealand’s capital is Wellington. It is the base for Parliament, the offices of the cabinet and prime minister, the residences of the prime minister and governor-general, and the country’s highest courts.\nThe first capital\nAfter the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in February 1840, Governor Willliam Hobson established his official residence at Russell in the Bay of Islands. This was New Zealand’s first capital.\nThe second capital\nSeveral Māori chiefs offered Hobson land at Tāmaki-makau-rau (Auckland) so he could establish a capital there. From March 1841 Auckland was the capital. After New Zealand became self-governing, the first General Assembly met in Auckland in May 1854. However, there was concern about the site, particularly because its northern location made it difficult to travel to – especially for MPs from the South Island.\nChoosing a third capital\nIn the 1850s some MPs attempted to have the General Assembly meet in a more central location. Wellington hosted a session of the assembly in 1862, and in 1863 it was proposed that the capital be moved somewhere on the shores of Cook Strait. An independent tribunal of three Australians decided on the location. They visited a number of sites and chose Wellington – a decision that led to public protest in Auckland, and an unsuccessful bid by Auckland assembly members to separate from the rest of the country.\nWellington, the third capital\nWellington has been the capital since 1865. It gains economic benefits from jobs for public servants and government investment in infrastructure. National cultural organisations such as the Royal New Zealand Ballet, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa are in Wellington – as is the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park. In 2011 travel publisher Lonely Planet described Wellington as the ‘coolest little capital in the world’.",
                "Wellington, capital city of New Zealand\nAll...\nWellington, capital city of New Zealand\nHugged by picturesque hillsides and a magnificent harbor, Wellington is New Zealand's most appealing city. Although its rival, Auckland, has much to offer, the capital is home to a wealth of cultural and artistic treasures, galleries, theaters, shops, restaurants, bars and cafes. The words “I'm bored” never come out of the mouths of travelers there, and most find themselves wishing they had longer to explore this hip, dynamic and downright beautiful city.\nTe Papa is the biggest “must-see” in the capital. The national museum of New Zealand is fun, very interactive and full of delightful surprises. Appropriately, the museum's name translates as “treasure box,” and inside, visitors will find an amazing collection of Maori artifacts and natural history and environment exhibitions. The museum is also home to the national art collection, galleries dedicated to the history of both the country and region and hands-on discovery centers made for children but enjoyed by adults too. Most of the displays have a high-tech twist, like simulator rides and interactive elements. The six floors of Te Papa take at least a full day to explore, but if you have less time, take the one-hour introductory tour that highlights the best of the collection.\nThe Museum of Wellington City and Sea takes the interactive aspects of Te Papa and applies them to the city's social and maritime history. Imaginative and innovative, the exhibits tell the stories of ancient Maori legends and include moving documentaries about the Wahine and other sea tragedies.\nNew Zealand Cricket Museum\nNational Tattoo Museum\nThere are a number of other impressive museums in Wellington, each giving visitors a glimpse into part of the country's culture, history and people. The New Zealand Cricket Museum bowls over fans of the sport with historical memorabilia, the National Tattoo Museum includes thousands of examples of skin art, including both traditional and contemporary styles, and the Cable Car Museum tells the story of the interesting mode of transportation.\nFrom the museum, visitors can enjoy the old-time thrills of riding in a cable car to the Wellington Botanic Gardens. The 25-hectare gardens includes a stretch of native forest lined with varied collections including international plant collections and an enchanting rose garden. Other charms at the gardens include a duck pond, cheerful playground, magical city views, sculptures, a terraced cafe and more, making it a delightful place to spend a day.\nThe Carter Observatory, located at the top of the gardens, is home to a full-dome planetarium. Regular shows present virtual tours of the skies above the city, and the center also includes a fine collection of telescopes, plenty of astronomical artifacts and a multimedia display detailing the techniques of Maori cosmology and Polynesian navigation.\nEnvironmentalists and adventurers have long hailed New Zealand's natural environment. The country's separation from other lands has facilitated the evolution and survival of many ancient animals and plants, and you can see many of them up close at Zealandia. The groundbreaking eco-sanctuary is just two kilometers outside of Wellington, and the fenced valley is home to over 30 native bird species, such as saddleback, rare takahe, hihi and kaka. The lush grounds also include the country's largest wild population of little spotted kiwi and tuatara. There are more than 30 kilometers of trails to be explored, and the night tours offer a rare opportunity to spot nocturnal glowworms, kiwi and frogs.\nOther must-see sights in the capital include the conservation-focused Wellington Zoo, the National Library of New Zealand, the contemporary City Gallery, the kids' complex at Capital E, the English Gothic Old St. Paul's church, Matiu-Somes Island, the austere Parliament House and the New Zealand Portrait Gallery in the historic waterfront district.\nWellington Geographical Location\nWellington is located on the Northern Island on its southern tip. It faces the Cook Straight and is the third most populated urban area in New Zealand with approximately 400,000 people.\nWellington Language\nEnglish, Maori, and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages of New Zealand. Other common languages throughout the country are Samoan, French, Hindi, Yue, and Northern Chinese among others with many speaking multiple languages.\nWellington Predominant Religion\n10% Presbyterian, Congregational, and Reformed\n5% Christian (with no specificity)\n3% Methodist",

                "2. – Capital city – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand\nWhen the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in February 1840 and New Zealand became part of the British Empire, a beginning was made towards establishing a nation, a capital and a government.\nRussells old and new\nThe site of New Zealand’s first capital was bought in 1830 by a London merchant and ship owner, James Clendon, who had established a friendship with local Ngāpuhi chiefs. In 1839 Clendon was appointed the first US consul in New Zealand. Following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, Governor William Hobson purchased Clendon’s property (about 150 hectares) as the site for the colony’s capital. After the capital moved to Auckland, the settlement burned to the ground, in 1842. Its name, Russell, was transferred to Kororāreka – today’s Russell. The site of the first Government House, at Okiato, is sometimes referred to as Old Russell.\nNew Zealand’s first capital\nAfter the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in February 1840, New Zealand’s first resident governor, William Hobson, established his first official residence – the country’s first Government House. It was located at Okiato, in the Bay of Islands, 7 kilometres south of Kororāreka (which was the only sizeable European town, but was inconveniently situated, insecure and with a reputation for lawlessness). Hobson named the new capital Russell, after Britain’s then secretary of state for the colonies (Lord John Russell).\nA second capital\nHobson was subsequently offered land by several Māori chiefs for the purpose of establishing his capital in a more favourable position. The land, some 250 kilometres south of the Bay of Islands on the shores of the Waitematā Harbour, was known as Tāmaki-makau-rau (Tāmaki of a hundred lovers). Hobson accepted the offer, made his purchase and named the site Auckland, after his patron, Lord Auckland, governor-general of India and former first lord of the admiralty. The new town – the colony’s new capital – began to be built on 15 September 1840.\nTough trip\nIt was not easy for South Island members to travel to Auckland for the first meeting of the General Assembly in 1854. Otago members arrived at Lyttelton on 2 April, but they did not leave for Auckland until 11 May. The steamer took 12 days and they reached Auckland the day before Parliament opened. The ship anchored a mile offshore, and the men were forced to wade in their shoes and stockings through mud and stones. Once on dry land, they had to carry their bags along the shore for half a mile before meeting the carriages sent to pick them up.\nMoving to Auckland\nThe governor’s establishment of his premises there in March 1841 made Auckland, by definition, the colonial capital and the centrepiece for government, politics and official decision-making. The passage by the British Parliament of the New Zealand Constitution Act in June 1852 gave further impetus to what might today be described as a nation-building process. The act provided for the establishment of a colonial legislature, and elections in October 1853 led to the convening of the colony’s first General Assembly (as the legislature was called) in May 1854, in Parliament Buildings erected on a hill in Auckland.\nDissatisfaction with Auckland\nThere was dissatisfaction with Auckland as the site of a national capital virtually from the outset. In the mid-19th century, communication and transportation links among the colony’s scattered European settlements were in early stages of development. There were also provincial rivalries, with those living in Wellington and the South Island resentful of Auckland and the governor’s residence there.\nAuckland’s location, far from the centre of the colony, made it an especially unpopular choice for many of those elected to serve in the General Assembly. In addition to the length and discomfort of travel to Auckland, there was also displeasure over the long periods of separation from family, farms and businesses for those serving as representatives in the capital. By the 1860s, partly as a result of the discovery of gold, the South Island had a considerably larger population than the North Island. Moving the capital southwards was also contemplated in part to forestall South Island discontent and possible secessionist tendencies.",

It is a place of interest to all who enjoy a stroll along the waterfront, a hike through New Zealand bush, a day trip to the museum or a visit to the local gallery and stop by in one of the many cafés.\n\" Te Papa Tongarewa \" as the \"New Zealand Museum\" is called is the first thing I think of when I think of Wellington. Te Papa is a Museum located right next to the water front. The first time I visited the museum I had to come back again the next day because it was so big that I didn’t have enough time on the first day to explore it. Te Papa isn’t your ordinary old fashioned museum, with most of the displays being interactive for the old, young and the young at heart.\nWellington the capital of New Zealand has also its very own zoo. It's not the biggest zoo in the world, but it is one of the few in the world that has the iconic New Zealand brown kiwi bird .\nIf you’re an art enthusiast then you will probably find an excursion to the Wellington gallery quite inspiring. The gallery stocks contemporary international art, New Zealand art , Pacific art and Maori art a short walk from central Wellington. You can pop in and have a quick browse through or if you’re the type that spends time to really take in the art work there is plenty to look at.\nThe city of Wellington also has a beautiful botanical garden located close to down town Wellington. The garden stretches for 25 hectares of hilly landscape covered in pristine plant life. There are also several walking tracks that wind through the garden perfect for an afternoon stroll while the sun casts shadows revealing the intricate pattern of the trees above. You can also combine the trip to the garden with a ride on the historical Wellington cable carts which were first opened over a decade ago.

The building received this name because the Executive Wing resembles a skep which is a woven bee hive. Tours are offered at the \"Beehive\" so you can take a closer look on how New Zealand politics works. Fans of architecture can even have a look inside some of the rooms.\nThe city of Wellington is a great place to tour, have a look around or attend one of the major Wellington events that come to New Zealand. There are heaps of things to keep you occupied.\nAuthor: Karim Cisse webmaster of www.Easy-Science-Experiments.com",

                "The Eurovision Song Contest (),  sometimes popularly called Eurovision but not to be confused with the Eurovision network that broadcasts it, is the longest-running annual international TV song competition,  held, primarily, among the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 1956. The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo - Festival of Italian Music held in Italy since 1951.\n\nEach participating country submits an original song to be performed on live television and radio and then casts votes for the other countries' songs to determine the most popular song in the competition. The contest has been broadcast every year for sixty years, since its inauguration in 1956, and is one of the longest-running television programmes in the world. It is also one of the most watched non-sporting events in the world,  with audience figures having been quoted in recent years as anything between 100 million and 600 million internationally.   Eurovision has also been broadcast outside Europe to several countries that do not compete, such as the USA, Canada, New Zealand, and China. An exception was made in 2015, when Australia was allowed to compete as a guest entrant as part of the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the event.    In November 2015, the EBU announced that Australia was invited back as a participant in the 2016 contest, after the 2015 success.  Since 2000, the contest has also been broadcast over the Internet, via the Eurovision website. \n\nWinning the Eurovision Song Contest provides a short-term boost to the winning artists' career, but rarely results in long-term success.  Notable exceptions are ABBA (winner in 1974 for Sweden), Bucks Fizz (winner in 1981 for the United Kingdom) and  (winner in 1988 for Switzerland), all of whom launched successful worldwide careers after their wins.\n\nIreland holds the record for the highest number of wins, having won the contest seven times—including four times in five years in 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1996. The highest scoring winner is Jamala of Ukraine who won the 2016 contest in Stockholm, Sweden with 534 points. This was, however, achieved under a new scoring system, and would not have surpassed the previous record (the 387 points achieved by Alexander Rybak of Norway in 2009) under the system in use between 1975 and 2015. Had the 2016 system been in use in 2009, Rybak would have scored 690 points.\n\nThe latest winner of the Eurovision Song Contest is Jamala of Ukraine, who won the 2016 contest in Stockholm, Sweden, with the song \"1944\".\n\nOrigins \n\nIn the 1950s, as a war-torn Europe rebuilt itself, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)—based in Switzerland—set up an ad hoc committee to search for ways of bringing together the countries of the EBU around a \"light entertainment programme\".  At a committee meeting held in Monaco in January 1955 with Marcel Bezençon of the Swiss television as chairman, the committee conceived the idea (initially proposed by Sergio Pugliese of the Italian television RAI) of an international song contest where countries would participate in one television programme to be transmitted simultaneously to all countries of the union.  The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo Music Festival held in Italy  and was seen as a technological experiment in live television, as in those days it was a very ambitious project to join many countries together in a wide-area international network. Satellite television did not exist, and the Eurovision Network comprised a terrestrial microwave network.  The concept, then known as \"Eurovision Grand Prix\", was approved by the EBU General Assembly in a meeting held in Rome on 19 October 1955, and it was decided that the first contest would take place in spring 1956 in Lugano, Switzerland. The name \"Eurovision\" was first used in relation to the EBU's network by British journalist George Campey in the London Evening Standard in 1951.\n\nThe first contest was held in the town of Lugano, Switzerland, on 24 May 1956. Seven countries participated—each submitting two songs, for a total of 14. This was the only contest in which more than one song per country was performed: since 1957, all contests have allowed one entry per country. The 1956 contest was won by the host nation, Switzerland. \n\nNaming \n\nThe programme was first known as the \"Eurovision Grand Prix\" (in English). This \"Grand Prix\" name was adopted by Denmark, Norway and the Francophone countries, with the French designation being '.  The \"Grand Prix\" has since been dropped and replaced with' (contest) in French, but not in Danish or Norwegian. The Eurovision network is used to carry many news and sports programmes internationally, among other specialised events organised by the EBU.  However, in the minds of the public, the name \"Eurovision\" is most closely associated with the Song Contest.\n\nFormat \n\nThe format of the contest has changed over the years, though the basic tenets have always been thus: participant countries submit new original songs, which are performed live in a television programme transmitted across the Eurovision Network by the EBU simultaneously to all countries.  A \"country\" as a participant is represented by one television broadcaster from that country: typically, but not always, that country's national public broadcasting organisation. The programme is hosted by one of the participant countries, and the transmission is sent from the auditorium in the host city. During this programme, after all the songs have been performed, the countries then proceed to cast votes for the other countries' songs: nations are not allowed to vote for their own song. At the end of the programme, the winner is declared as the song with the most points. The winner receives, simply, the prestige of having won—although it is usual for a trophy to be awarded to the winning songwriters, and the winning country is invited to host the event the following year.\n\nThe programme is invariably opened by one or more presenters, welcoming viewers to the show. Between the songs and the announcement of the voting, an interval act is performed. These acts can be any form of entertainment imaginable. Interval entertainment has included such acts as the Wombles ()  and the first international presentation of Riverdance (). \n\nAs national broadcasters join and leave the Eurovision feed transmitted by the EBU, the EBU/Eurovision network logo ident (not to be confused with the song contest logo) is displayed. The accompanying theme music (used on other Eurovision broadcasts) is the prelude to Marc-Antoine Charpentier's Te Deum. Originally, the same logo was used for both the Eurovision network and the European Broadcasting Union; however, they now have two different logos; when the ident is transmitted, it is the Eurovision network logo that appears.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest finals are traditionally held on a Saturday evening in May, at 19:00 UTC (15:00 EDT, 20:00 BST/IST, or 21:00 CEST). Usually one Saturday in May is chosen, although the contest has been held on a Tuesday (since the two semi final system was introduced in 2008), on a Thursday (in 1956; and since 2005 in the semi-finals)  and as early as March (in 1979). \n\nParticipation \n\nEligible participants include primarily Active Members (as opposed to Associate Members) of the EBU. Active members are those who are located in states that fall within the European Broadcasting Area, or are member states of the Council of Europe. \n\nThe European Broadcasting Area is defined by the International Telecommunication Union: \n\nThe western boundary of Region 1 is defined by a line running from the North Pole along meridian 10° West of Greenwich to its intersection with parallel 72° North; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 50° West and parallel 40° North; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 20° West and parallel 10° South; thence along meridian 20° West to the South Pole. \n\nActive members include broadcasting organisations, whose transmissions are often made available to at least 98% of households in their own country which are equipped to receive such transmissions.\n\nIf an EBU Active Member wishes to participate they must fulfil conditions as laid down by the rules of the contest. A separate copy is drafted annually. As of 2015, this includes the necessity to have broadcast the previous year's programme within their country, and the broadcaster must have paid the EBU a participation fee in advance of the deadline specified in the rules of the contest for the year in which they wish to participate.\n\nEligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the \"Euro\" in \"Eurovision\" – nor does it have any relation to the European Union. Several countries geographically outside the boundaries of Europe have competed: Israel and Cyprus in Western Asia (Cyprus is a member of the Council of Europe and a member state of the European Union), since 1973 and 1981 respectively; Australia in the Australian continent, since 2015  and Morocco, in North Africa, in the 1980 competition alone. In addition, several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe have competed: Turkey, since 1975; Russia, since 1994; Armenia, since 2006; Georgia, since 2007; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition. \n\n52 countries have participated at least once.  These are listed here alongside the year in which they made their début:\n\na) Before German reunification in 1990 occasionally presented as West Germany, representing the Federal Republic of Germany. East Germany (the German Democratic Republic) did not compete.\nb) The entries presented as being from \"Yugoslavia\" represented the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, except for the 1992 entry, which represented the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This nation dissolved in 1991/92 into five independent states: Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia reconstituted itself as Serbia and Montenegro in 2003—entered the contest in 2004—and finally dissolved in 2006, making two separate states: Serbia and Montenegro; both of which made their début in the contest in 2007, the winner that year being Serbia.\nc) The participation of Australia was intended as a one-off event to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Contest unless they won in 2015 in which case they would have been allowed to defend their crown in 2016. However it was revealed in May 2015 that Australia might become a permanent participant following some reports by Jon Ola to the Swedish broadcaster.  In November 2015, the EBU announced that Australia would return in 2016 and after this the country will become an effective participant in the contest.\n\nHosting \n\nMost of the expense of the contest is covered by commercial sponsors and contributions from the other participating nations. The contest is considered to be a unique opportunity for promoting the host country as a tourist destination. In the summer of 2005, Ukraine abolished its normal visa requirement for visitors from the EU to coincide with its hosting of the event. \n\nPreparations for the event start a matter of weeks after the host wins in the previous year, and confirms to the EBU that they intend to—and have the capacity to—host the event. A host city is chosen—often a national or regional capital city—and a suitable concert venue is identified. The two largest concert venues were Parken in Copenhagen (which held approximately 38,000 people when Denmark hosted in 2001) and the Esprit Arena in Düsseldorf (which held approximately 36,500 people when Germany hosted in 2011). The smallest town to have been hosts was Millstreet in County Cork, Ireland, in 1993. The village had a population of 1,500 —although the Green Glens Arena venue could hold up to 8,000 people. \n\nThe hotel and press facilities in the vicinity are always a consideration when choosing a host city and venue.  In Kiev 2005, hotel rooms were scarce as the contest organisers asked the Ukrainian government to put a block on bookings they did not control themselves through official delegation allocations or tour packages: this led to many people's hotel bookings being cancelled. \n\nHost country \n\nAfter the first two contests were hosted by Switzerland and Germany, it was decided that henceforth the winning country would host the contest the next year. The winner of the 1957 Contest was the Netherlands, and Dutch television accepted the responsibility of hosting in 1958. In all but five of the years since this rule has been in place, the winning country has hosted the show the following year. The exceptions are:\n\n* —hosted by the BBC in London when the Netherlands declined due to expense. The UK was chosen to host because it had come second in 1959.\n* —hosted by the BBC in London when France declined due to expense. Although the UK had only come fourth in 1962, Monaco and Luxembourg (who came second and third) had also declined.\n* —hosted by the BBC in Edinburgh when Monaco was unable to provide a suitable venue: Monegasque television invited the BBC to take over due to its previous experience.\n* —hosted by the BBC in Brighton when Luxembourg declined due to expense. The BBC was becoming known as the host by default, if the winning country declined.\n* —hosted by the NOS in The Hague when Israel declined due to expense, having staged the  event in Jerusalem, and the fact that the date chosen for the contest (19 April) was Israel's Remembrance Day that year. The Dutch offered to host the contest after several other broadcasters (including the BBC) were unwilling to do so. The reluctance of those national broadcasters to stage the contest were due to already having hosted the event during the past couple of years, in addition to the expense involved.\n\nWith the invitation of Australia to participate since 2015, it was announced that due to the logistical and financial issues that would occur if Australia were to host, in the event of an Australia victory, the broadcaster SBS will co-host the next contest in a European city in collaboration with an EBU Member Broadcaster of their choice. However, this has yet to happen and since 1981, all contests have been held in the country which won the previous year.\n\nEurovision logo and theme \n\nThe former generic logo was introduced for the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest in Turkey, to create a consistent visual identity. The host country's flag appears in the heart of the generic logo. Each year of the contest, the host country creates a sub-theme which is usually accompanied and expressed with a sub-logo and slogan. The theme and slogan are announced by the EBU and the host country's national broadcaster.\n\nThe generic logo was revamped in 2014, ten years after the first generic logo was created. The revamped logo was conducted by lead designer Cornelis Jacobs and his team of Cityzen Agency.  The logo was used for the first time in the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest, the 60th anniversary of the contest.\n\nSlogans \n\nSince the 2002 contest, slogans (or themes) have been introduced in the show (2009 being the only exception). The slogan is decided by the host broadcaster and based on the slogan, the theme and the visual design are developed.\n\nEurovision Week \n\nThe term \"Eurovision Week\" is used to refer to the week during which the Contest takes place.  As it is a live show, the Eurovision Song Contest requires the performers to have perfected their acts in rehearsals in order for the programme to run smoothly. In addition to rehearsals in their home countries, every participant is given the opportunity to rehearse on the stage in the Eurovision auditorium. These rehearsals are held during the course of several days before the Saturday show, and consequently the delegations arrive in the host city many days before the event. Journalists and fans are also present during the preceding days, and so the events of Eurovision last a lot longer than a few hours of television. A number of officially accredited hotels are selected for the delegations to stay in, and shuttle-bus services are used to transport the performers and accompanying people to and from the contest venue. \n\nEach participating broadcaster nominates a Head of Delegation, whose job it is to co-ordinate the movements of the delegate members, and who acts as that country's representative to the EBU in the host city.  Members of the delegations include performers, lyricists, composers, official press officers and—in the years where songs were performed with a live orchestra—a conductor. Also present if desired is a commentator: each broadcaster may supply their own commentary for their TV and/or radio feed, to be broadcast in each country. The commentators are given dedicated commentary booths situated around the back of the arena behind the audience.\n\nRehearsals and press conferences \n\nSince 2004, the first rehearsals have commenced on the Sunday almost two weeks before the Grand Final. There are two rehearsal periods for each country. The countries taking part in the semi-finals have their first rehearsal over four days from the first Sunday to Wednesday. The second is from Thursday to Sunday. The countries which have already directly qualified for the Grand Final rehearse on the Saturday and Sunday. \n\nAfter each country has rehearsed, the delegation meets with the show's artistic director in the video viewing room. Here, they watch the footage of the rehearsal just performed. At this point the Head of Delegation may make known any special requirements needed for the performance, and request them from the host broadcaster. Following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference where members of the accredited press may pose them questions.  The rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing. A printed summary of the questions and answers which emerge from the press conferences is produced by the host press office, and distributed to journalists' pigeon-holes. \n\nBefore each of the semi-finals three dress rehearsals are held. Two rehearsals are held the day before (one in the afternoon and the other in the evening), while the third is held on the afternoon of the live event. Since tickets to the live shows are often scarce, tickets are also sold in order that the public may attend these dress rehearsals.\n\nThe same applies for the final, with two rehearsals on the Friday and the third on Saturday afternoon before the live transmission of the grand final on Saturday evening. For both semi-finals and for the final, the second dress rehearsal is also the Jury Final, this is where the jury from each country casts their votes. This means that 50% of the result is already decided before the live contests have taken place.\n\nParties and Euroclub \n\nOn the Monday evening of Eurovision Week, a Mayor's Reception is traditionally held, where the city administration hosts a celebration that Eurovision has come to their city. This is usually held in a grand municipally owned location in the city centre. All delegations are invited, and the party is usually accompanied by live music, complimentary food and drink and—in recent years—fireworks. \n\nAfter the semi-final and grand final there are after-show parties, held either in a facility in the venue complex or in another suitable location within the city. \n\nA Euroclub is held every night of the week: this is a Eurovision-themed nightclub, to which all accredited personnel are invited. \n\nDuring the week many delegations have traditionally hosted their own parties in addition to the officially sponsored ones. However, in the new millennium the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity and hold their celebrations in the Euroclub.\n\nRules \n\nNumerous detailed rules must be observed by the participating nations, and a new version is produced each year, for instance the rules specify various deadlines, including the date by which all the participating broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the EBU. The rules also cover sponsorship agreements and rights of broadcasters to re-transmit the show. The most notable rules which affect the format and presentation of the contest have changed over the years, and are highlighted here.\n\nLive music \n\nAll vocals must be sung live; no voices are permitted on the backing tracks. In 1999, the Croatian song featured sounds on their backing track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. The Croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices, but only digitally synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. The EBU nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year for the purpose of calculating their five-year points average for future qualification. \n\nFrom 1956 until 1998, the host country was required to provide a live orchestra. Before 1973, all music had to be played by the host orchestra. From 1973 onwards, pre-recorded, non-vocal backing tracks were permitted—although the host country was still obliged to provide a live orchestra in order to give participants a choice. If a backing track was used, then all the instruments heard on the track were required to be present on the stage. In 1997 this requirement was dropped.\n\nIn 1999 the requirement for a live orchestra was removed: it was left as an optional contribution. The host that year, Israel's IBA, decided not to use an orchestra in order to save expenses, and thus 1999 was the first year when all the songs were played as pre-recorded backing tracks (in conjunction with live vocals).\n\nLanguage \n\nEach submission must have vocals; purely instrumental music has never been allowed. In the past, competitors have been required to sing in one of their own national languages, but this rule has been changed several times over the years. From 1956 until 1965, there was no rule restricting the languages in which the songs could be sung. In 1966 a rule was imposed stating that the songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, after Sweden presented its 1965 entry in English.\n\nThe language restriction continued until 1973, when performers were again allowed to sing in any language they wished.  Several winners in the mid-1970s took advantage of this: performers from non-English-speaking countries sang in English, including ABBA in 1974.\n\nIn 1977, the EBU decided to revert to the national language restriction. However, special dispensation was given to Germany and Belgium as their national selections had already taken place; both countries' entries were in English. \n\nIn 1999 the rule was changed to allow the choice of language once more. Belgium entered the 2003 Contest with \"Sanomi\", a song sung in a constructed language,  finishing in second place. In 2006 the Dutch entry, \"Amambanda\", was sung partly in English and partly in an artificial language. In 2008 the Belgian entry, \"O Julissi\", was sung in an artificial language. In 2011 the Norwegian entry, \"Haba Haba\", which was sung in English and Swahili, was the first song to be sung in an African language, apart from Arabic. \n\nVoting \n\nThe voting system used in the contest has changed over the years. The current system has been in place since 2016, and is a positional voting system. Each country awards two sets of 12, 10, 8–1 points to their 10 favourite songs: one from their professional jury of votes of five music professionals and the other from televoting. \n\nHistorically, a country's votes were decided by an internal jury, but in 1997 five countries (Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom) experimented with televoting, giving members of the public in those countries the opportunity to vote en masse for their favourite songs. The experiment was a success,  and from 1998 onwards all countries were encouraged to use televoting wherever possible. Back-up juries are still used by each country, in the event of a televoting failure. Nowadays members of the public may also vote by SMS, in addition to televoting.  From 2013, the public may also vote via a mobile app.  \n\nThe current method for ranking entries, introduced in 2016, is to sum together the points calculated from the telephone vote and the jury separately. Prior to this, the jury and televoting rankings were combined 50/50 before the number of points were calculated.  It was first used in the final of the 2009 edition, and extended the following year to the semi-finals.\n  \n\nSince 1964 the voting has been presided over by the EBU scrutineer, who is responsible for ensuring that all points are allocated correctly and in turn. The following are the scrutineers and Executive Supervisors of the Eurovision Song Contest appointed by the EBU:\n*  Rolf Liebermann (1956)\n*  Miroslav Vilček (1964–65)\n*  Clifford Brown (1966–77)\n*  Frank Naef (1978–92)\n*  Christian Clausen (1993–95)\n*  Christine Marchal-Ortiz (1996, 1998–2002)\n*  Marie-Claire Vionnet (1997)\n*  Sarah Yuen (2003)\n*  Svante Stockselius (2004–10)\n*  Jon Ola Sand (2011–)\n\nAccording to one study of Eurovision voting patterns, certain countries tend to form \"clusters\" or \"cliques\" by frequently voting in the same way. \n\nPresentation of votes \n\nAfter the interval act is over, when all the points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to invite them to announce the results of their vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over telephone lines; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson standing in front of a backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, the participating countries were called in reverse order of the presentation of their songs, and from 1963 to 2003, they were called in the same order in which their songs had been presented (except for 1974). Since 2004, when semi-finals were introduced, the order of the countries' announcements of votes has changed; and the countries that did not make it to the final each year could also vote. In 2004, the countries were called in alphabetical order (according to their ISO codes).  In 2005, the votes from the non-qualifying semi-finalists were announced first, in their running order on the Thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in their own order of performance. Between 2006 and 2010, a separate draw was held to determine the order in which countries would present their votes.  In 2011, the voting order was determined by the results of a jury the day before the final so as to create as much suspense as possible when the votes were revealed. \n\nFrom 1971 to 1973, each country sent two jurors, who were present at the contest venue (though the juries in 1972 were locked away in the Great Hall of Edinburgh Castle) and announced their votes as the camera was trained on them. In 1973 one of the Swiss jurors made a great show of presenting his votes with flamboyant gestures. This system was retired the next year.\n\nIn 1956 no public votes were presented: a closed jury simply announced that Switzerland had won.  From 1957 to 1987, the points were displayed on a physical scoreboard to the side of the stage. As digital graphic technology progressed, the physical scoreboards were superseded in 1988 by an electronic representation which could be displayed on the TV screen at the will of the programme's director.\n\nIn 2006 the EBU decided to save time during the broadcast—much of which had been taken up with the announcement of every single point—because there was an ever-increasing number of countries voting. Since then, votes from 1 to 7 from each country have been displayed automatically on screen and the remaining points (8, 10 and 12) are read out in ascending order by the spokesperson, culminating with the maximum 12 points. Countries must announce the country names and points in either English or French and the scores are repeated by the contest's presenters in the other language. The expression ' when the host or spokesperson states the top score in French is popularly associated with the contest. \n\nTies for first place \n\nIn , four of the sixteen countries taking part, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. There was nothing in the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among most of the other participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.  \n\nUnder the current rules, in the event of more than one country scoring the same total number of points, a count is made of the numbers of countries who awarded points to each of the tied countries, and the one who received points from the most countries is declared the winner. If the numbers are still tied, it is counted how many sets of maximum points (12 points) each country received. If there is still a tie, the numbers of 10-point scores awarded are compared—and then the numbers of 8-point scores, all the way down the list. In the extremely unlikely event of there then still being a tie for first place, the song performed earliest in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed first in the running order. Since 2008, the same tie-break rule now applies to ties for all places. \n\nAs of , the only time since 1969 when two or more countries have tied for first place on total points alone was in , when France and Sweden both totalled 146 points. At that time, the rules did not include counting the numbers of countries awarding any points to these countries' songs, but began with tallying up the numbers of 12-point scores awarded. Both France and Sweden had received four sets of 12 points. However, because Sweden had received more sets of 10-point scores, they were declared the winners. Had the current rule been in play, France would have won instead.\n\nBroadcasting \n\nEach participating broadcaster is required to broadcast the show in its entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the interval act for advertising breaks if they wish. From 1999 onwards, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to take more advertising breaks as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the programme. Three major interruptions or preemptions of the contest broadcast have taken place since 1999. The Dutch state broadcaster pulled their broadcast of the 2000 final to provide emergency news coverage of a major incident, the Enschede fireworks disaster. Spain's RTVE delayed their broadcast of the second semi-final in the 2009 Contest, due to the Madrid Open tennis tournament. The Albanian state broadcaster deferred their broadcast of the first semi-final in 2012 to provide emergency news coverage of the Qafa e Vishës bus accident.\n\nArchive status \n\nThe first edition ever of the Eurovision Song Contest of 1956 was broadcast live and never recorded, and only a sound recording of the radio transmission has survived from the original broadcast.  The ninth edition of 1964 was recorded on tape, but a fire destroyed the copy, and it's unknown if any other TV station in Europe has another copy. Only small portions of the original broadcast and audio from the radio transmission have survived.\n\nPolitical recognition issues \n\nIn 1978, during the performance of the Israeli entry, the Jordanian broadcaster JRTV suspended the broadcast and showed pictures of flowers. When it became apparent during the later stages of the voting sequence that Israel was going to win the contest, JRTV abruptly ended the transmission. Afterwards, the Jordanian news media refused to acknowledge that Israel had won and announced that the winner was Belgium (who had actually come in 2nd place).  In 1981 JRTV did not broadcast the voting because the name of Israel appeared on the scoreboard.\n\nIn 2005, Lebanon intended to participate in the contest. However, Lebanese law does not allow recognition of Israel, and consequently Lebanese television did not intend to transmit the Israeli entry. The EBU informed them that such an act would breach the rules of the contest, and Lebanon was subsequently forced to withdraw from the competition. Their late withdrawal incurred a fine, since they had already confirmed their participation and the deadline had passed.  However, the Eurovision Song Contest albums were still being sold in Lebanese music stores until 2009, with the word Israel erased from the back cover. As of 2010, the albums were banned completely from sale.\n\nIn 2009, the song \"We Don't Wanna Put In\" was selected to represent Georgia. However, the song text was banned by Eurovision as it was interpreted as criticism against Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin after the Russo-Georgian War the previous year. When asked to change the lyrics of the song, the Georgian broadcaster GPB withdrew from the 2009 contest. \n\nOther \n\n* In the first contest in 1956, there was a recommended time limit of 3½ minutes per song.  In 1957, despite protests, the Italian song was 5:09 minutes in duration. This led to a stricter time limit of 3 minutes precisely.  Since the three-minute time limit was adopted in 1960, some artists have had songs longer than three minutes, which must be edited down to 3 minutes, though some songs exceed that time by a few seconds. Many of the entries also have longer versions (including different languages) for commercial release, and since the 1990s, some are released in additional remixed versions.\n* The EBU imposes no restrictions on the nationalities of the performers or songwriters. Individual broadcasters are, however, permitted to impose their own restrictions at their discretion.\n* From 1957 to 1970 (in 1956 there was no restriction at all) only soloists and duos were allowed on stage. From 1963, a chorus of up to three people was permitted. Since 1971, a maximum of six performers have been permitted on the stage.\n* The performance and/or lyrics of a song \"must not bring the Contest into disrepute\". No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature are permitted. No swearing or unacceptable language is allowed, neither are commercial messages.\n* From 1990 onwards, all people on stage must be at least 16 years of age.\n* No live animals.\n* Each artist may perform for only one country per year.\n* The music and text must not have been published or performed before 1 September of the year before the contest is held. Many countries also have the additional rule that the song shall never have been performed before the relevant national Eurovision Contest. Covers, reworked or sampled versions of older songs are not allowed. \n\nExpansion of the contest \n\nThe number of countries participating has steadily grown over time, from seven in 1956 to over 20 in the late 1980s. In 1993, twenty-five countries participated in the competition, including, for the first time, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, entering independently due to the dissolution of Yugoslavia. \n\nBecause the contest is a live television programme, a reasonable time limit must be imposed on the duration of the show. In recent years the nominal limit has been three hours, with the broadcast occasionally over-running.\n\nPre-selections and relegation \n\nSince 1993, and following the cessation of the Eastern European OIRT network and the merger with the EBU, there have been more entries than there is time to reasonably include in a single TV show. Several relegation or qualification systems have been tried in order to limit the number of countries participating in the contest at one time. Thus the 1993 Contest introduced two new features: first, a pre-selection competition was held in Ljubljana in which seven new countries fought for three places in the international competition. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia took part in Kvalifikacija za Millstreet; and the three former Yugoslav republics, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, qualified for a place in the international final.  Also to be introduced that year was \"relegation\": the lowest-placed countries in the 1993 score table were not invited in 1994, to allow the countries which failed the 1993 pre-selection into the 1994 Contest. The 1994 Contest included—for the first time—Estonia, Romania, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Russia. \n\nRelegation continued in 1994 and 1995;  but in 1996 a different pre-selection system was used, in which nearly all the countries participated. Audio tapes of all the songs were sent to juries in each of the countries some weeks before the television show. These juries selected the songs which would be included in the international broadcast.  Norway, as the host country in 1996 (having won the previous year), automatically qualified and so did not need to go through pre-selection.\n\nOne country which failed to qualify in the 1996 pre-selection was Germany. As one of the largest financial contributors to the EBU, their non-participation in the contest brought about a funding issue, which the EBU would have to consider.\n\nBig Four and Big Five \n\nSince 2000, France, Germany, Spain and United Kingdom have automatically qualified for the final, regardless of their positions on the scoreboard in previous contests, as they are the four biggest financial contributors to the EBU. These countries became known as the \"Big Four\". On 31 December 2010, it was announced that Italy would compete in the Eurovision Song Contest after a fourteen-year absence and that it would also automatically qualify for the final, joining the other four qualifiers to become the \"Big Five\", considered by some to be a controversial decision.  Germany became the first and, as of 2016, the only \"Big Five\" country to win the contest since the rule was made in 2000, when Lena Meyer-Landrut won the 2010 Contest. Turkey withdrew from the 2013 Contest with the status of the \"Big Five\" being one of the reasons cited.  They also did not participate in the following 3 years' of contests (2014-2016) for similar reasons, as well as stating their opposition to the 50/50 jury and televoting in that began being applied in Final at the 2009 Contest. \n\nQualification and semi-finals \n\nFrom 1997 to 2001, countries qualified for each contest based on the average of their points totals for their entries over the previous five years.   However, there was much discontent voiced over this system because a country could be excluded merely because of poor previous results, which did not take into account how good a fresh attempt might be. This led the EBU to create what was hoped would be a more permanent solution to the problem. A qualification round, known as the semi-final, was introduced for the 2004 Contest.  This semi-final was held on the Wednesday during Eurovision Week, and was a programme similar in format to the grand final, whose time slot remained 19:00 UTC on the Saturday. The highest-placed songs from the semi-final qualified for the grand final, while the lower-placed songs were eliminated. From 2005 to 2007, the semi-final programme was held on the Thursday of Eurovision Week.  In these two shows there was enough time to include all the countries who wished to participate.\n\nThe ten highest-placed non-Big Four countries in the \"grand final\" were guaranteed a place in the following year's grand final, without having to qualify. If, for example, Germany came in the top ten, the eleventh-placed non-Big-Four country would automatically qualify for the next year's grand final. The remaining countries—which had not automatically qualified for the grand final—had to enter the semi-final.\n\nAt the 50th annual meeting of the EBU reference group in September 2007, it was decided that, with still more nations entering, starting from the 2008 contest onwards two semi-finals would be held,  from each of which one could qualify for the final.  From 2008 onwards, the scoreboard position in previous years has not been relevant, and—save for the automatic qualifiers—all participating countries have had to participate in the semi-finals, regardless of their previous year's scoreboard position. The only countries which automatically qualify for the grand final are the host country and the Big Five: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, who continue to enjoy their protected status.\n\nIn each of the semi-finals the voting is conducted among those countries which participate in that semi-final. With regard to the automatic grand final qualifiers, who do not participate in the semi-finals, a draw is conducted to determine in which semi-final each of them will be allowed to vote. In contrast, every participating country in a particular year may vote in the Saturday grand final – whether their song qualified for the final or not.\n\nThe ten countries which receive the most votes in each semi-final qualify for the grand final. They are announced by the presenters in English and French, in a random order. Full voting results are withheld until after the grand final, whereupon they are published on the EBU's website. To date only five countries have always qualified to the Final since the implementation of the semi-finals system in 2004: Australia, Azerbaijan, Romania, Russia and Ukraine.\n\nWinners \n\nWinning artists \n\nThere have been a number of Eurovision artists and groups whose careers were directly launched into the spotlight following their win. Notable examples were ABBA, who won the contest for Sweden in 1974 with their song \"Waterloo\", and went on to become one of the most successful bands of all time,  and the French Canadian singer Céline Dion, who won the contest for Switzerland in 1988 with the song \"Ne partez pas sans moi\", which subsequently helped launch her international career,\nand the winners of the 1981 contest, Bucks Fizz for the United Kingdom with the song \"Making Your Mind Up\", which also launched their successful international career.\n\nOther artists who have achieved varying degrees of success after winning the contest include\n\nFrance Gall (\"Poupée de cire, poupée de son\", Luxembourg 1965), Dana (\"All Kinds of Everything\", Ireland 1970),\nVicky Leandros (\"Après toi\", Luxembourg 1972),\nBrotherhood of Man (\"Save Your Kisses for Me\", United Kingdom 1976), Johnny Logan (who won twice for Ireland; with \"What's Another Year\" in 1980, and \"Hold Me Now\" in 1987).\n\nSeveral other winners were well-known artists who won the contest mid-career after they had already established themselves, including Katrina and the Waves, winners in 1997 with \"Love Shine a Light\",  Lulu, winner in 1969 with \"Boom Bang-a-Bang\", and Sandie Shaw, winner in 1967 with \"Puppet on a String\". Women have dominated the contest since its inception, either performing solo or as a member of a group on 50 of the 64 winning entries as of 2016.\n\nWinning countries \n\n holds the record for the highest number of wins, having won the contest seven times—including four times in five years in 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1996.  is second with six wins as of 2016. ,  and the  are joint third with five wins. Next comes the , with four victories. Three countries have won three times, ,  and . Six countries have won twice, , , , ,   and .\n\nThe United Kingdom holds the record for the highest number of runner-up placings, coming in second on no less than 15 occasions as of 2016. Germany, France, Spain and Ireland have four runner-up entries.\n\nThe early years of the contest saw many wins for \"traditional\" Eurovision countries: France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. However, the success of these countries has declined in recent decades; the Netherlands last won in 1975; France, in 1977; and Luxembourg, in 1983. Luxembourg last entered the contest in 1993. \n\nThe first years of the 21st century produced numerous first-time winners, from both \"new\" and long-serving countries who had previous entered numerous times but without victories. Every year from 2001 to 2008 inclusive, a country won for its first time. Estonia was the first post-Soviet country to win the competition in 2001. In 2005,  won for the first time and it was the second time that a Balkan country won. The 2006 winner was , which finally won after having entered the contest for 45 years. , on the other hand, did not have to wait so long, winning with only their second entry in 2004.\n\n won the very first year it entered as an independent state, in 2007, with a ballad in Serbian language.  Interestingly, in 2004,  also almost won the initial year it entered as a competitor state, finishing up second behind Ukraine, also with a ballad in Serbian language.  Other relatively quick winners were , who won in 2002, only their third year competing, and Azerbaijan, who won in 2011 in only their fourth year in the competition. \n\nThe country that has participated the longest without any win is , which made its debut in 1964 and has never finished in the top five.  is the most successful country without a win, achieving two-second places and two third places. \n\nIn 2009,  won the contest with 387 points - Alexander Rybak held the winning title with his song - Fairytale. His outstanding performance meant he had the highest total in the history of the competition, becoming the first competitor to score 300 or more points, including 16 maximum scores. This feat was emulated in 2012, when Sweden won with 372 points, but with a new record of 18 maximum scores. However, in 2016,  won the contest with a new record of 534 points, thanks to the new voting system which doubled the maximum amount of points. In 2015,  won the contest with 365 points, becoming the first competitor to ever reach 300 points or more twice while winning both times.  placed second with 303 points, becoming the first country to score more than 300 points without winning. In 2016, the scoring system changed, which meant that it was much easier to achieve over 300 points - in fact, the winner - Jamala, achieved 534 points.\n\nSince the introduction of the 50/50 voting system in 2009, the juries and the voters have disagreed on the winner on three occasions, in 2011, 2015, and in 2016. 2011 winner Azerbaijan won only the televotes (jury votes were won by Italy) and 2015 winner Sweden won only the jury votes (televotes were won by Italy). In 2016, Ukraine did not win either the jury vote or the televote, but won the contest with the highest combined vote. The Televote was won by Russia and the jury vote by Australia.\n\nAnniversaries \n\nSongs of Europe \n\nIn 1981, a concert television programme was held to commemorate the contest's twenty-fifth anniversary. The event, entitled Songs of Europe, took place in Mysen, Norway, featuring nearly all the winners of the contest, from 1956 to 1981. It was hosted by Rolf Kirkvaag and Titten Tei.\n\nCongratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest \n\nIn 2005, the EBU had agreed with the Danish broadcaster, DR, to produce a programme to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the contest. The show, entitled Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest after Cliff Richard's  entry for the United Kingdom, was held in Copenhagen, and featured a competition among fourteen of the most popular songs from the last 50 years of the contest. A telephone vote was held to determine the most popular Eurovision song of all-time, which was won by the ABBA song \"Waterloo\" (winner for Sweden in ).  The event was hosted by the 1997 Contest winner for the United Kingdom, Katrina Leskanich, and Latvia's representative on its debut at the 2000 Contest, Renārs Kaupers.\n\nEurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits \n\nIn 2015, the EBU had decided again to commemorate the contest and agreed with the United Kingdom's broadcaster, BBC, to produce a show for the 60th anniversary of the contest, after evaluating several proposals from member broadcasters in regards to the anniversary celebration beyond the 2015 Contest in May.    The event, entitled Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits, took place at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, London  and featured fifteen acts from thirteen countries in the official line-up.   Unlike the 50th anniversary show in 2005 which was broadcast live, this event didn't feature a competition and was pre-recorded to be televised across Europe and other EBU members on various dates schedule by the respective broadcasters. The event was hosted by the British commentator for Eurovision, Graham Norton, and the host of the 2013 Contest and of the 2016 Contest, Petra Mede.\n\nIn late 2011, the EBU had begun archiving all the contests since the first edition in 1956 in order to be finalised before the 2015 Contest, for the 60th anniversary.  It was later reported that the archive is ready and will be released on the 60th anniversary with making the content available to journalists in broadcast-ready formats while also giving public accessibility to \"selected content\" through the official Eurovision website. \n\nCriticism and controversy \n\nThe contest has been the subject of criticism regarding both its musical and political content.   For example, on rare occasions, certain countries have been booed when performing or receiving points, especially when being given by a neighbour country. Most recently in 2014 and 2015, Russia was heavily booed when it qualified for the final and received high points.   The reason for the booing is considered to be due to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and opposition to the country's policy on LGBT rights. \n\nMusical style and presentation \n\nBecause the songs play to such a diverse supranational audience with contrasting musical tastes, and countries want to be able to appeal to as many people as possible to gain votes, this has led to the music of the contest being characterised as a \"mishmash of power ballads, ethnic rhythms and bubblegum pop\".  This well-established pattern, however, was notably broken in 2006 with Finnish hard rock band Lordi's victory.  As Eurovision is a visual show, many performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, notably elaborate lighting sequences and pyrotechnics; sometimes leading to bizarre on-stage theatrics, costumes, including the use of revealing dress. \n\nPolitical and geographical voting \n\nThe contest has long been accused by some of political bias: the perception is that judges and televoters allocate points based on their nation's relationship to the other countries, rather than the musical merits of the songs.  According to one study of Eurovision voting patterns, certain countries tend to form \"clusters\" or \"cliques\" by frequently voting in the same way. Another study concludes that as of 2006, voting blocs have, on at least two occasions, crucially affected the outcome of the contest.  On the other hand, others argue that certain countries allocate disproportionately high points to others because of similar musical tastes and cultures and because they speak similar languages,   and are therefore more likely to appreciate each other's music.\n\nAs an example, Terry Wogan, the United Kingdom's well-known presenter of Eurovision since 1980 and one of the only three presenters mentioned by name during the contest proper  stood down from the BBC One's broadcast in 2008 citing \"The voting used to be about the songs. Now it's about national prejudices. We (the UK) are on our own. We had a very good song, a very good singer, we came joint last. I don't want to be presiding over another debacle\". \n\nAnother influential factor is the high proportion of expatriates and ethnic minorities living in certain countries. Although judges and televoters cannot vote for their own country's entry, expatriates can vote for their country of origin.\n\nThe total numbers of points to be distributed by each country are equal, irrespective of the country's population. Thus voters in countries with larger populations have less power as individuals to influence the result of the contest than those voting in smaller countries. For example, San Marino holds the same voting power as Russia despite the vast geographic and population differences between them.\n\nTo try to reduce the effect of voting blocs, national juries were re-introduced alongside televoting in the final in 2009: each contributing 50% of the vote.  This hybrid system was expanded in 2010 to also be implemented in the semi-finals.  However, since 1994 no country has won two years in a row, and semi-finals have also been won by different countries, until 2012 when Sweden won the second semi-final in 2011 and 2012. Although many of them used to give their 12 points to the same country each year, like Cyprus and Greece, it has been noticed that factors such as the sets of other high votes received (7, 8 or 10 points) and the number of countries giving points to a specific entry, also highly affect the final positions.\n\nRunning order of the participating songs \n\nFrom the 2013 contest onwards, the final running order of the competing performances at the semi-finals and the final has been decided by the producers of the show and then approved by the EBU Executive Supervisor and the Reference Group. Prior to this, a random draw system was used to decide the running order for the contests. The random draw method is still used to decide the performance position of the host nation, to ensure fairness. The aim of this change was to make the shows more exciting and ensure that all contestants had a chance to stand out, preventing entries that are too similar cancelling each other out.  The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans of the contest and participating broadcasters.    \nAn allocation draw also occurs for the final, with each finalist nation drawing to perform either in the first or second half of the final  and for the host country \nWhile the running order is partly decided by the producers and approved by the EBU Executive Supervisor and the Reference Group of the contest, some consider it to be controversial because of the risk of corruption, manipulation and benefits for some countries, since the running order is considered to be of importance to the result.  \n\nSpin-offs \n\nA number of spin-offs and imitators of the Eurovision Song Contest have been produced over the years, some national and other international.\n\nSimilar competitions that are still held, include:\n* Sopot International Song Festival (1961–80, 1984–2003, 2005–09, 2012–), held in Sopot, Poland, annually.\n* Östersjöfestivalen also called Baltic Song Contest (1967–present), held annually in Karlshamn, Sweden.\n* Cân i Gymru (1969–72, 1974–), held annually in Wales, was intended to be BBC Cymru's pre-selection show when Wales expressed an interest in participating in the  Eurovision Song Contest separately from the rest of the United Kingdom.\n* Caribbean Song Festival (1984–), held annually between members of the Caribbean Broadcasting Union.\n* Festivali i Këngës (1962–), held annually in Tirana, Albania, has been used to select Albania's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest since 2003.\n* Junior Eurovision Song Contest (2003–), for European artists under the age of 16.\n* Asia Song Festival (2004–), held annually in South Korea.\n* Bundesvision Song Contest (2005–), held annually between the 16 states of Germany since 2005.\n* ABU Song Festivals (2012–), two Asia-Pacific versions, the biennial ABU Radio Song Festival and the annual ABU TV Song Festival.\n* Türkvizyon Song Contest (2013–), an annual competition that launched in December 2013, for countries and autonomous regions that have Turkic links. \n* Liet-Lávlut (2002–), an annual competition between European Ethnic minorities and languages.

                "Katrina and the Waves were a British/American rock band best known for the 1985 hit \"Walking on Sunshine\". They also won the 1997 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Love Shine a Light\".\n\nHistory\n\nPre-history (1975–80)\n\nThe band's earliest incarnation was as The Waves, a group that played in and around Cambridge, England, from 1975 to 1977 and featured guitarist Kimberley Rew and drummer Alex Cooper.  This incarnation of the Waves never issued any recordings, and broke up when Rew left to join the Soft Boys.\n\nA more direct ancestor of Katrina and the Waves was the band Mama's Cookin', a pop cover band hailing from Feltwell, England.  This band, founded in 1978, featured American Katrina Leskanich on vocals and keyboards, and her then-boyfriend (and fellow American) Vince de la Cruz on vocals and lead guitar.  By late 1980, Alex Cooper had joined the band on drums, with Bob Jakins on bass.  Mama's Cookin' proceeded to gig steadily in England over the next two years, specialising in covers of songs by American acts such as Heart, Foreigner, Linda Ronstadt, and ZZ Top.\n\nEarly days as The Waves (1981–82)\n\nWhen The Soft Boys broke up in 1981, Rew contacted his old Wave-mate Cooper to see about renewing their musical partnership.  Cooper convinced Rew to join Mama's Cookin', and the five-piece group (Leskanich/Rew/Cooper/de la Cruz/Jakins) was quickly renamed The Waves after the band Rew and Cooper had been in together in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe Waves were initially fronted by singer/songwriter/guitarist Rew, who brought a wealth of original material to the band. Leskanich, meanwhile, originally only sang lead vocals on the cover tunes in the band's repertoire. However, over the first year of the Waves' existence, Rew began to write material for Leskanich to sing, and she was soon the primary vocalist.\n\nThe Waves made their initial recorded appearances on a 1982 single (\"Nightmare\"/\"Hey, War Pig!\"); both tracks were included on the 1982 Rew solo album called The Bible of Bop. The Waves then issued their debut EP Shock Horror later in 1982.  Around this time, bassist Jakins left the band. Jakins was not replaced, as de la Cruz took over on bass and the band was renamed Katrina and the Waves.\n\nEarly Canadian success (1983–84)\n\nIn early 1983, the fledgling band recorded—at their own expense—an LP of their original material designed to be sold at gigs.  Rew wrote all the songs on this LP, while Leskanich sang eight of the album's ten tracks.  (Rew sang lead on the other two.)\n\nThe LP was shopped around to various labels, but only Attic Records in Canada responded with an offer.  Consequently, although they were based in England, Katrina and The Waves' first album Walking On Sunshine was released only in Canada.\n\nThe album garnered enough critical attention and radio play (especially for the title track) to merit a Canadian tour.  In 1984, the group released a follow-up album in Canada (Katrina and the Waves 2), with Leskanich now handling all the lead vocals.  Rew was still the primary songwriter, but de la Cruz was also responsible for a few songs, including the Canadian airplay hit \"Mexico\".\n\nAlso in 1984, their song \"Going Down to Liverpool\" was covered by the Bangles, which added to their profile. With the group building a fan base with their recordings and extensive touring, major label interest began to build, and Katrina and the Waves eventually signed an international deal with Capitol Records in 1985.\n\n\"Walking on Sunshine\" and international success (1985–89)\n\nFor the first Capitol album, the band re-recorded, remixed, or overdubbed  10 songs from their earlier Canadian releases to create their self-titled international debut album in 1985.\n\nThe Katrina and the Waves album was a substantial critical and commercial success, and the group had a worldwide hit with the song \"Walking on Sunshine,\" (No. 9 US, No. 8 UK, a completely re-recorded, and substantially rearranged version of the song when compared to its initial 1983 Canada-only release).  A Grammy award nomination for \"Best New Artist\" followed, as did constant touring, both of which helped to spur moderate sales of new releases.\n\nA follow-up single to \"Walking on Sunshine\" called \"Do You Want Crying\" (written by de la Cruz) also became a top 40 US hit, reaching No. 37 in the late summer of 1985.\n\nHowever, the band's follow-up album to Katrina and the Waves (simply entitled Waves) didn't meet with the same measure of success, either critically or commercially.  Rew wrote only two of the ten songs on the LP; de la Cruz and Leskanich each wrote four. Drummer Cooper, interviewed some years later, claimed \"It was (a) mistake when we started taking over from Kimberley in the musical contribution side. The second Capitol album was awful...\".\n \nThe album did spin off a minor UK and US hit in the form of the Rew-penned \"Is That It?\" (No. 70 US, No. 82 UK), and \"Sun Street\" (a de la Cruz composition) was a UK Top 30 hit in 1986. However, Capitol dropped the band after the Waves album didn't perform to expectations.\n\nThe band subsequently recorded a 1989 album for Capitol-distributed SBK Records called Break of Hearts, a harder, more rock-oriented effort than their previous releases.  The album included \"That's the Way\" which reached No. 16 in the US (credited to Leskanich/Rew), but subsequent singles, including \"Rock 'n' Roll Girl\", failed to chart, and the band once again were dropped from their label.\n\nDownturn and surprise comeback (1990–97)\n\nThroughout the nineties, Katrina and the Waves recorded fairly steadily, though most releases were available only in continental Europe and/or Canada, and they issued no charting singles. They also recorded the song \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\" with Eric Burdon for the TV series \"China Beach\" in 1990.\n\nBy the late nineties, however, the band had all but disappeared—until they surprisingly (if briefly) surged back into the limelight by winning the 1997 Eurovision Song Contest for the United Kingdom on 3 May 1997 with the song \"Love Shine a Light\". Reacting to the win, Leskanich said it was the second landslide victory in a week; the song won by a record points margin, and Tony Blair had won the 1997 British general election two days previously. The song won by a then-record margin of 70 points over the Irish runner-up. \n\n\"Love Shine a Light\" became Katrina and the Waves' biggest-ever UK hit, peaking at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. \n\nDissolution (1998–99)\n\nDespite their return to the public eye in the UK, Katrina and the Waves were not able to follow up \"Love Shine a Light\" with another hit, and Leskanich left the group in 1998 after several disagreements within the band. Legal wrangling followed, preventing Leskanich from using the band name. Though attempts were made by the Waves to find a new \"Katrina\" to front the group, the three remaining group members eventually dissolved the band to pursue individual careers in 1999.\n\nImpact of Hurricane \"Katrina\" (2005)\n\nWhen Hurricane Katrina and its storm surge devastated much of the U.S. Gulf Coast in September 2005, the MSNBC news program, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, dubbed its coverage of the hurricane, \"Katrina and the Waves\"; the name also appeared in numerous headlines and blog postings. A New York Times reporter contacted Katrina Leskanich, who said: \"The first time I opened the paper and saw 'Katrina kills 9,' it was a bit of a shock. ... I hope that the true spirit of 'Walking on Sunshine' will prevail. I would hate for the title to be tinged with sadness, and I will have to do my own part to help turn that around.\" \n\nRecent activity (2010–13)\n\n2010 marked the 25th anniversary of the release of \"Walking on Sunshine\" and a series of back-catalogue reissues and a re-recorded version of the track were  released.  A free download of one of the tracks from Kimberley Rew's solo album Bible of Bop was given away in March 2010 from the band's website.  Katrina Leskanich released The Live Album in July 2010 - a mix of Katrina and the Waves hits and new songs recorded in London and Germany.\n\nIn June, 2011, the group threatened legal action against U.S. presidential candidate Michele Bachmann for playing their music on her campaign trail. A statement on the group's official website reads: \"Katrina & The Waves would like it to be known that they do not endorse the use of Walking On Sunshine by Michele Bachmann and have instructed their lawyers accordingly.\" Leskanich stated that she wants to ban the Republican from using the track because she does not agree with her politics.\n\nIn July, 2013, Katrina rejoined the Waves to perform at the San Fermín festival in Spain for the penultimate gig of the season on Plaza del Castillo.\n\nMembers \n\n* Katrina Leskanich  – vocals, rhythm guitar\n* Kimberley Rew  – lead guitar\n* Vince de la Cruz – bass\n* Alex Cooper – drums\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nCompilation albums\n\n* Roses (1995) (Canadian release only – compiles tracks from Edge of the Land and Turnaround)\n* Katrina and the Waves / Waves (1996)\n* Walking on Sunshine – The Greatest Hits of Katrina & the Waves (1997)\n* The Original Recordings – 1983–1984 (2003)\n\nSingles\n\nNB The re-recording of \"Que Te Quiero\" and \"Red Wine and Whiskey\" were released as a double A-side in the UK following \"Walking on Sunshine\" and \"Do You Want Crying?\"",
                "\"Love Shine a Light\" was the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1997, performed by Katrina and the Waves as the 1997 Eurovision entrant by the UK and the lead single from the album Walk on Water. It is the group's biggest success since \"Walking on Sunshine\" 12 years earlier.\n\nComposition/Great British Song Contest\n\nThe song was composed by the group's guitarist and regular songwriter Kimberley Rew following a request from the brother of the group's drummer Alex Cooper for an anthem for The Samaritans in recognition of that organization's thirtieth anniversary, Cooper's brother being a member of the Swindon branch of the Samaritans. In a 1997 interview Katrina and the Waves lead vocalist Katrina Leskanich indicated that it was members of the Samaritans who opined that \"Love Shine a Light\" \"was the type of song which would win the Eurovision Song Contest and [so] at the last minute, [Katrina and the Waves] submitted the song with our £250 [entrance fee]\" [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+SAMARITANS+SAVED+MY+CAREER%3B+Katrina%27s+charity+lifeline.-a061012091 THE SAMARITANS SAVED MY CAREER; Katrina's charity lifeline. - Free Online Library] for consideration to vie in the Great British Song Contest, the national preselection round for the UK in Eurovision 1997.\n\nIt was also reported that Carmina Cooper, the manager of Katrina and the Waves and the wife of Alex Cooper, met up with BBC Radio Cambridgeshire's breakfast presenter (and Head of Music) Dan Chisholm to play the track for him: Chisholm's response was to urge that the number be entered in the Great British Song Contest, and after affording \"Love Shine a Light\" its radio airplay debut Chisholm declared it \"the song which will win this year's Eurovision Song Contest\".\n\nIn a 2010 interview Leskanich would state that Great British Song Contest executive producer Jonathan King had in fact initiated Katrina and the Waves involvement in the Great British Contest as he'd contacted Leskanich to ask if her group had a song which might be a suitable contender to vie to become the UK entrant at Eurovision 1997. Leskanich would paraphrase her response to King as being: \"Yes, we have this song called 'Love Shine A Light' which we’ve never put on a record because it's too cheesy, too ABBA, too Eurovision, so it would be perfect for you.\" \n\nLeskanich stated in 2010 that the original plan was that an act other than Katrina and the Waves would be found to perform \"Love Shine a Light\" for Eurovision consideration but that Warner Bros. Records executive Steve Allan - who  Leskanich describes as \"a big Eurovision fan...it’s always been his dream to win it\" - said: \"Look, you guys have a name, we can still do business in Europe. All you need is a hit song, and we want you to do it. And if you do do it we’ll give you a record deal\"; adds Leskanich: \"So we couldn’t say no.\" Leskanich would also state that Kimberley Rew had said of Katrina and the Waves pursuing the Eurovision 1997 title with his composition: \"I’m not having anything to do with it\". In fact Rew would play guitar on stage while Leskanich sang \"Love Shine a Light\" - Rew being the only instrumentalist onstage -on the March 9, 1997 broadcast of the Great British Song Contest final which program also featured a taped interview with Rew in which he described Eurovision as \"one of those great institutions of life\"; also Rew accompanied Leskanich onstage to be congratulated for \"Love Shine a Light\"'s being announced at the UK entrant for Eurovision 1997.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\nqNBoDwN9RlM Great British Song Contest 1997 - YouTube] However Rew was absent from the Katrina and the Waves performance of \"Love Shine a Light\" at the Eurovision 1997 final held on May 3, 1997.\n\nOne of eight songs aired in the Great British Song Contest semi-final broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on February 7, 1997, \"Love Shine a Light\" was one of four songs advanced by televote to the Great British Song Contest final. The Great British Song Contest final was  a live performance show broadcast by BBC TV on March 9, 1997, at the conclusion of which \"Love Shine a Light\" was announced as the 1997 UK entrant in Eurovision, the song having received 69,834 televotes – 11,138 more than the second-place finisher. \n\nEurovision 1997 final\n\nPerformance\n\nOn the night of the Eurovision 1997 final – held on May 3, 1997 in the Point Theatre, Dublin – \"Love Shine a Light\" was performed 24th in a field of 25 songs being preceded by the Croatian entry: \"Probudi me\", with the Icelandic entry: \"Minn hinsti dans\", following as the final competitive number of Eurovision 1997.\n\nLeskanich would later state she'd supplied her own outfit for her performance on the Eurovision 1997 finale: \"the boys [ie. the Waves] were getting beautiful suits made by [http://www.williamhunt.co.uk/savile-row/suits.html/ William Hunt] and my outfit was an afterthought. They came [in] with five different designers and every single outfit made me look like a clown or a chair cover...I ended up wearing this green blouse I’d been wearing all week that I’d bought in the Cambridge market for £3 [with] a [dark velvet] jacket that my sister had sent me, which was a Donna Karan second and it only had one shoulder pad. So while I was doing the song, I had to remember to lift my left shoulder slightly to even it out with the other\". She also wore black leather trousers and black high-heeled boots.\n\nThe Eurovision 1997 finale performance of \"Love Shine a Light\" was simply staged with Leskanich singing center stage fronting background vocalists Beverley Skeete and Miriam Stockley: Skeete and Stockley, respectively dark-haired and blonde and clad in long dark dresses, also provided accompaniment with tambourines and handclaps. Two of Leskanich's co-members in Katrina and the Waves: drummer Alex Cooper and bassist Vince de la Cruz, were positioned towards the right side of the stage while guitarist Phil Nichol played guitar stage left.[http://www.diggiloo.net/?info.1997uk Love shine a light - info - Diggiloo Thrush]\nPhil Nichol was not a permanent member of Katrina and the Waves being a substitute for the group's regular guitarist - and the song's composer - Kimberley Rew, who Leskanich would later state had disassociated himself from the group's participating with his song in Eurovision 1997 (although Rew had accompanied Leskanich on the performance of \"Love Shine a Light\" on the March 9, 1997 broadcast of the Great British Song Contest final which had not featured any other members of Katrina and the Waves). Don Airey, who played as a session musician on the single recording of the song, arranged and conducted the live version for Katrina & The Waves. He added strings, brass and a vibrato flute, giving the song a more anthemic feel. \n\nScoring\n\nIn a pre-performance interview on the night of the Eurovision 1997 finale Leskanich had stated that Katrina and the Waves winning Eurovision 1997 was \"more than a dream - it's probably going to be a reality. I mean we wouldn't come here unless we were intending to win...For Eurovision [success] you need a song with a universal message, lighters in the air, Coca-Cola, heartwarming positive 'all-unite' [message]...[Our] song has a universality about it that unites everyone and I think people are looking for that message in Eurovision...they want something uplifting and positive, and I think once in a while a song comes along that says Eurovision and I think that's what 'Love Shine a Light' says and I'm just lucky that I'm the one that gets to sing it.\"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnbnGs95Hg Interview with Katrina and The Waves (United Kingdom 1997) - YouTube]\n\n\"Love Shine a Light\" did indeed win Eurovision 1997 easily: with its first 12-point score being awarded by Austria the fourth reporting jury \"Love Shine a Light\" assumed permanent possession of first place on the scoreboard with its final vote tally an unprecedented 227 points besting the second-place finishing Eurovision 1997 entrant, the entrant for Ireland: \"Mysterious Woman\", by 70 points. The final vote tally for \"Love Shine a Light\" at Eurovision 1997 set a record unsurpassed until 2004, when the introduction of the semi-final greatly expanded the number of countries voting in the final (indeed, entire top three polled more than 227 points that year). It also received the maximum 12 points from ten countries, a feat not matched until 2005 and not beaten until 2009.\n\nBy a more directly comparable measure, \"Love Shine a Light\" received an average of 9.458 points per country or 78.82% of total votes available, the third-highest in the history of the present voting system, behind only \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" by Brotherhood of Man in 1976 (9.647 points per jury, 80.39% of available points) and \"Ein bißchen Frieden\" by Nicole in 1982 (9.470 votes per jury, 78.91% of available points). Furthermore, the song received maximum points from ten of twenty-four countries (41.7%), the fourth highest of all time behind \"Euphoria\" by Loreen in 2012  (which received 12 points from eighteen of forty-one countries, or 43.9%), \"Non ho l'età\" by Gigliola Cinquetti in 1964 (receiving the then-maximum 5 points from eight of fifteen countries, or 53.3%) and \"Ein bißchen Frieden\" in 1982 (12 points from nine of seventeen countries, or 52.9%).\n\nKatrina Leskanich commented that it was the second landslide of the week – the Labour Party led by Tony Blair had won the UK general election held two days earlier, on 1 May 1997.\n\nAftermath\n\nIn a 2009 interview Leskanich restated her opinion of \"Love Shine a Light\": \"it was such a feel-good, lighters-in-the-air, cheesy number. It would have been embarrassing for it not to win. It had 'I am a winner' written all over it\", while adding: \"Our song was quickly forgotten because we didn’t have any sensational gimmick like Bucks Fizz\" and describing Eurovision as \"a joke...People who take it seriously are the kind of people who get into Miss Universe. How can you have a contest about what's the best song?\" Leskanich also stated that Katrina and the Waves Eurovision victory boosted the group's profile on the European cabaret circuit at the expense of their rock band credibility which heavily factored into the band's 1999 breakup.\n\nThe song was succeeded in 1998 as Contest winner by Dana International representing Israel performing \"Diva\". This song was also performed as part of a medley in the introduction of the 50th anniversary show for the ESC in Copenhagen as well as the semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, in Athens.\n\nA remix of the song was performed during the UK selection process final of 2008, Eurovision: Your Decision.\n\nCover versions\n\n*On the 1997 album Ett hus med många rum Kikki Danielssons orkester, featuring Kikki Danielsson on lead vocals, covered the song with lyrics in Swedish by Christer Lundh and Mikael Wendt, as Låt ett ljus få brinna (translated \"Let a candle burn\"). \n* In 1997 the German schlager singer Christian Anders published a Single \"Liebe und Licht\" as a slowed-down version.\n*Heidi Kyrö recorded the song in 1998, the Finnish version of the name \"Päivänvaloon\". \n*The song was covered in a way of eurodance by the DJ Mauro Farina a.k.a. Speedmaster in 2002, appearing on Dancemania Speed 9 with the name Love Shine A \"Speedy\" Light. \n*In 2008, Italian Eurodance group Katty B released a Euro House cover that became popular in Italy. It included three acts including an extended version and an instrumental version \n*Danish duo The Olsen Brothers (winners of the 2000 Contest) recorded a version for their 2010 album Wings of Eurovision.\n*South African singer André Huysamen covered the song in Afrikaans as \"Liefde skyn 'n lig\". The song also appeared in his debut album Elektries release in April 2012.\n*Garry Hagger (nl recorded the song as \"Liefde brengt licht\" for his 2014 album release 12 points which comprised Flemish renderings of Eurovision winners.\n*The Irish singer Lee Matthews released it as a charty single on 23 May 2014 with proceeds going to the Irish charity Join Our Boys Trust, a charity for those suffering from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.  The single peaked at number 1 in Irish Country Charts and also charted at number 68 in the Irish Pop Charts.\n\nCharts"

                "Red blood cells (RBCs), also called erythrocytes, are the most common type of blood cell and the vertebrate organism's principal means of delivering oxygen (O2) to the body tissues—via blood flow through the circulatory system.   RBCs take up oxygen in the lungs or gills and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body's capillaries.\n\nThe cytoplasm of erythrocytes is rich in hemoglobin, an iron-containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen and is responsible for the red color of the cells. The cell membrane is composed of proteins and lipids, and this structure provides properties essential for physiological cell function such as deformability and stability while traversing the circulatory system and specifically the capillary network.\n\nIn humans, mature red blood cells are flexible and oval biconcave disks. They lack a cell nucleus and most organelles, in order to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin; they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin, with a plasma membrane as the sack. Approximately 2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults.  The cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate for about 100–120 days in the body before their components are recycled by macrophages.  Each circulation takes about 20 seconds. Approximately a quarter of the cells in the human body are red blood cells.   Nearly half of the blood's volume (40% to 45%) is red blood cells.\n\nRed blood cells are also known as RBCs, red cells,  red blood corpuscles, haematids, erythroid cells  or erythrocytes (from Greek erythros for \"red\" and kytos for \"hollow vessel\", with -cyte translated as \"cell\" in modern usage). Packed red blood cells (pRBC) are red blood cells that have been donated, processed, and stored in a blood bank for blood transfusion.\n\nHistory \n\nThe first person to describe red blood cells was the young Dutch biologist Jan Swammerdam, who had used an early microscope in 1658 to study the blood of a frog.  Unaware of this work, Anton van Leeuwenhoek provided another microscopic description in 1674, this time providing a more precise description of red blood cells, even approximating their size, \"25,000 times smaller than a fine grain of sand\".\n\nIn 1901, Karl Landsteiner published his discovery of the three main blood groups—A, B, and C (which he later renamed to O). Landsteiner described the regular patterns in which reactions occurred when serum was mixed with red blood cells, thus identifying compatible and conflicting combinations between these blood groups. A year later Alfred von Decastello and Adriano Sturli, two colleagues of Landsteiner, identified a fourth blood group—AB.\n\nIn 1959, by use of X-ray crystallography, Dr. Max Perutz was able to unravel the structure of hemoglobin, the red blood cell protein that carries oxygen. \n\nThe oldest intact red blood cells ever discovered were found in Ötzi the Iceman, a natural mummy of a man who died around 3255 BCE. These cells were discovered in May 2012. \n\nVertebrate erythrocytes\n\nErythrocytes consist mainly of hemoglobin, a complex metalloprotein containing heme groups whose iron atoms temporarily bind to oxygen molecules (O2) in the lungs or gills and release them throughout the body. Oxygen can easily diffuse through the red blood cell's cell membrane. Hemoglobin in the erythrocytes also carries some of the waste product carbon dioxide back from the tissues; most waste carbon dioxide, however, is transported back to the pulmonary capillaries of the lungs as bicarbonate (HCO3−) dissolved in the blood plasma. Myoglobin, a compound related to hemoglobin, acts to store oxygen in muscle cells. \n\nThe color of erythrocytes is due to the heme group of hemoglobin. The blood plasma alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells change color depending on the state of the hemoglobin: when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a dark red burgundy color. However, blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin.  Pulse oximetry takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide, forming carboxyhemoglobin which is a very bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nThe sequestration of oxygen-carrying proteins inside specialized cells (as opposed to oxygen carriers being dissolved in body fluid) was an important step in the evolution of vertebrates as it allows for less viscous blood, higher concentrations of oxygen, and better diffusion of oxygen from the blood to the tissues. The size of erythrocytes varies widely among vertebrate species; erythrocyte width is on average about 25% larger than capillary diameter, and it has been hypothesized that this improves the oxygen transfer from erythrocytes to tissues.\n\nThe only known vertebrates without erythrocytes are the crocodile icefishes (family Channichthyidae); they live in very oxygen-rich cold water and transport oxygen freely dissolved in their blood.  While they do not use hemoglobin anymore, remnants of hemoglobin genes can be found in their genome. \n\nNucleus\n\nErythrocytes in mammals are anucleate when mature, meaning that they lack a cell nucleus. In comparison, the erythrocytes of other vertebrates have nuclei; the only known exceptions are salamanders of the Batrachoseps genus and fish of the Maurolicus genus with closely related species.  \n\nThe elimination of the nucleus in vertebrate erythrocytes has been offered as an explanation for the subsequent accumulation of non-coding DNA in the genome.  The argument runs as follows: Efficient gas transport requires erythrocytes to pass through very narrow capillaries, and this constrains their size. In the absence of nuclear elimination, the accumulation of repeat sequences is constrained by the volume occupied by the nucleus, which increases with genome size.\n\nNucleated red blood cells in mammals consist of two forms: normoblasts, which are normal erythropoietic precurors to mature erythrocytes, and megaloblasts, which are abnormally large precursors that occur in megaloblastic anemias.\n\nSecondary functions\n\nWhen erythrocytes undergo shear stress in constricted vessels, they release ATP, which causes the vessel walls to relax and dilate so as to promote normal blood flow. \n\nWhen their hemoglobin molecules are deoxygenated, erythrocytes release S-nitrosothiols, which also act to dilate blood vessels,  thus directing more blood to areas of the body depleted of oxygen.\n\nErythrocytes can also synthesize nitric oxide enzymatically, using L-arginine as substrate, as do endothelial cells.  Exposure of erythrocytes to physiological levels of shear stress activates nitric oxide synthase and export of nitric oxide,  which may contribute to the regulation of vascular tonus.\n\nErythrocytes can also produce hydrogen sulfide, a signalling gas that acts to relax vessel walls. It is believed that the cardioprotective effects of garlic are due to erythrocytes converting its sulfur compounds into hydrogen sulfide. \n\nErythrocytes also play a part in the body's immune response: when lysed by pathogens such as bacteria, their hemoglobin releases free radicals, which break down the pathogen's cell wall and membrane, killing it.  \n\nMammalian erythrocytes\n\nMammalian erythrocytes are unique among the vertebrates as they are non-nucleated cells in their mature form. These cells have nuclei during early phases of erythropoiesis, but extrude them during development as they mature in order to provide more space for hemoglobin.  The enucleated erythrocytes, called reticulocytes, go on to lose all other cellular organelles such as their mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nAs a result of not containing mitochondria, these cells use none of the oxygen they transport; instead they produce the energy carrier ATP by the glycolysis of glucose and lactic acid fermentation on the resulting pyruvate.\n\nBecause of the lack of nuclei and organelles, mature red blood cells do not contain DNA and cannot synthesize any RNA, and consequently cannot divide and have limited repair capabilities.   The inability to carry out protein synthesis means that no virus can evolve to target mammalian red blood cells.   However, infection with parvoviruses (such as human parvovirus B19) can affect erythroid precursors, as recognized by the presence of giant pronormoblasts with viral particles and inclusion bodies, thus temporarily depleting the blood of reticulocytes and causing anemia. \n\nMammalian erythrocytes are typically shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a torus-shaped rim on the edge of the disk. This distinctive biconcave shape optimises the ﬂow properties of blood in the large vessels, such as maximization of laminar flow and minimization of platelet scatter, which suppresses their atherogenic activity in those large vessels.  However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre erythrocyte morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny spherical cells in mouse deer (family Tragulidae), and cells which assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family Cervidae). Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm.  Overall, mammalian erythrocytes are remarkably flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen load. \n\nIn large blood vessels, red blood cells sometimes occur as a stack, flat side next to flat side. This is known as rouleaux formation, and it occurs more often if the levels of certain serum proteins are elevated, as for instance during inflammation.\n\nThe spleen acts as a reservoir of red blood cells, but this effect is somewhat limited in humans. In some other mammals such as dogs and horses, the spleen sequesters large numbers of red blood cells which are dumped into the blood during times of exertion stress, yielding a higher oxygen transport capacity.\n\nHuman erythrocytes\n\nA typical human erythrocyte has a disk diameter of approximately 6.2–8.2 µm  and a thickness at the thickest point of 2–2.5 µm and a minimum thickness in the centre of 0.8–1 µm, being much smaller than most other human cells. These cells have an average volume of about 90 fL  with a surface of about 136 μm2, and can swell up to a sphere shape containing 150 fL, without membrane distension.\n\nAdult humans have roughly 20–30 × 1012 (20–30 trillion) red blood cells at any given time, comprising approximately 70% of the total human body cell number.  Women have about 4 to 5 million erythrocytes per microliter (cubic millimeter) of blood and men about 5 to 6 million; people living at high altitudes with low oxygen tension will have more). Red blood cells are thus much more common than the other blood particles: there are about 4,000–11,000 white blood cells and about 150,000–400,000 platelets in each microliter of human blood.\n\nHuman red blood cells take on average 20 seconds to complete one cycle of circulation. \n\nAs red blood cells contain no nucleus, protein biosynthesis is currently assumed to be absent in these cells, although a recent study indicates the presence of all the necessary biomachinery in the cells to do so.\n\nThe blood's red color is due to the spectral properties of the hemic iron ions in hemoglobin. Each human red blood cell contains approximately 270 million of these hemoglobin biomolecules, each carrying four heme groups; hemoglobin comprises about a third of the total cell volume. This protein is responsible for the transport of more than 98% of the oxygen (the remaining oxygen is carried dissolved in the blood plasma). The red blood cells of an average adult human male store collectively about 2.5 grams of iron, representing about 65% of the total iron contained in the body.   (See Human iron metabolism.)\n\nLife cycle\n\nHuman erythrocytes are produced through a process named erythropoiesis, developing from committed stem cells to mature erythrocytes in about 7 days. When matured, in a healthy individual these cells live in blood circulation for about 100 to 120 days (and 80 to 90 days in a full term infant).  At the end of their lifespan, they become senescent, and are removed from circulation. In many chronic diseases, the lifespan of the erythrocytes is markedly reduced (e.g. patients requiring haemodialysis).\n\nErythropoiesis\n\nErythropoiesis is the development process by which new erythrocytes are produced; it lasts about 7 days. Through this process erythrocytes are continuously produced in the red bone marrow of large bones, at a rate of about 2 million per second in a healthy adult. (In the embryo, the liver is the main site of red blood cell production.) The production can be stimulated by the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), synthesised by the kidney. Just before and after leaving the bone marrow, the developing cells are known as reticulocytes; these comprise about 1% of circulating red blood cells.\n\nFunctional lifetime\n\nThe functional lifetime of an erythrocyte is about 100–120 days, during which time the erythrocytes are continually moved by the blood flow push (in arteries), pull (in veins) and a combination of the two as they squeeze through microvessels such as capillaries.\n\nSenescence\n\nThe aging erythrocyte undergoes changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, erythrocyte programmed cell death. This process normally occurs at the same rate of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased in a wide variety of diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in erythrocytes lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.\n\nMuch of the resulting breakdown products are recirculated in the body. The heme constituent of hemoglobin are broken down into Fe3+ and biliverdin. The biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin, which is released into the plasma and recirculated to the liver bound to albumin.  The iron is released into the plasma to be recirculated by a carrier protein called transferrin.  Almost all erythrocytes are removed in this manner from the circulation before they are old enough to hemolyze. Hemolyzed hemoglobin is bound to a protein in plasma called haptoglobin, which is not excreted by the kidney. \n\nMembrane composition\n\nThe membrane of the red blood cell plays many roles that aid in regulating their surface deformability, flexibility, adhesion to other cells and immune recognition. These functions are highly dependent on its composition, which defines its properties. The red blood cell membrane is composed of 3 layers: the glycocalyx on the exterior, which is rich in carbohydrates; the lipid bilayer which contains many transmembrane proteins, besides its lipidic main constituents; and the membrane skeleton, a structural network of proteins located on the inner surface of the lipid bilayer. Half of the membrane mass in human and most mammalian erythrocytes are proteins.  The other half are lipids, namely phospholipids and cholesterol. \n\nMembrane lipids\n\nThe erythrocyte cell membrane comprises a typical lipid bilayer, similar to what can be found in virtually all human cells. Simply put, this lipid bilayer is composed of cholesterol and phospholipids in equal proportions by weight. The lipid composition is important as it defines many physical properties such as membrane permeability and fluidity. Additionally, the activity of many membrane proteins is regulated by interactions with lipids in the bilayer.\n\nUnlike cholesterol, which is evenly distributed between the inner and outer leaflets, the 5 major phospholipids are asymmetrically disposed, as shown below:\n\nOuter monolayer\n* Phosphatidylcholine (PC);\n* Sphingomyelin (SM).\n\nInner monolayer\n* Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE);\n* Phosphoinositol (PI) (small amounts).\n* Phosphatidylserine (PS);\n\nThis asymmetric phospholipid distribution among the bilayer is the result of the function of several energy-dependent and energy-independent phospholipid transport proteins. Proteins called “Flippases” move phospholipids from the outer to the inner monolayer, while others called “floppases” do the opposite operation, against a concentration gradient in an energy dependent manner. Additionally, there are also “scramblase” proteins that move phospholipids in both directions at the same time, down their concentration gradients in an energy independent manner. There is still considerable debate ongoing regarding the identity of these membrane maintenance proteins in the red cell membrane.\n\nThe maintenance of an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in the bilayer (such as an exclusive localization of PS and PIs in the inner monolayer) is critical for the cell integrity and function due to several reasons:\n\n* Macrophages recognize and phagocytose red cells that expose PS at their outer surface. Thus the confinement of PS in the inner monolayer is essential if the cell is to survive its frequent encounters with macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, especially in the spleen.\n* Premature destruction of thallassemic and sickle red cells has been linked to disruptions of lipid asymmetry leading to exposure of PS on the outer monolayer.\n* An exposure of PS can potentiate adhesion of red cells to vascular endothelial cells, effectively preventing normal transit through the microvasculature. Thus it is important that PS is maintained only in the inner leaflet of the bilayer to ensure normal blood flow in microcirculation.\n* Both PS and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) can regulate membrane mechanical function, due to their interactions with skeletal proteins such as spectrin and protein 4.1R. Recent studies have shown that binding of spectrin to PS promotes membrane mechanical stability. PIP2 enhances the binding of protein band 4.1R to glycophorin C but decreases its interaction with protein band 3, and thereby may modulate the linkage of the bilayer to the membrane skeleton.\n\nThe presence of specialized structures named \"lipid rafts\" in the erythrocyte membrane have been described by recent studies. These are structures enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids associated with specific membrane proteins, namely flotillins, stomatins (band 7), G-proteins, and β-adrenergic receptors. Lipid rafts that have been implicated in cell signaling events in nonerythroid cells have been shown in erythroid cells to mediate β2-adregenic receptor signaling and increase cAMP levels, and thus regulating entry of malarial parasites into normal red cells.  \n\nMembrane proteins\n\nThe proteins of the membrane skeleton are responsible for the deformability, flexibility and durability of the red blood cell, enabling it to squeeze through capillaries less than half the diameter of the erythrocyte (7–8 μm) and recovering the discoid shape as soon as these cells stop receiving compressive forces, in a similar fashion to an object made of rubber.\n\nThere are currently more than 50 known membrane proteins, which can exist in a few hundred up to a million copies per erythrocyte. Approximately 25 of these membrane proteins carry the various blood group antigens, such as the A, B and Rh antigens, among many others. These membrane proteins can perform a wide diversity of functions, such as transporting ions and molecules across the red cell membrane, adhesion and interaction with other cells such as endothelial cells, as signaling receptors, as well as other currently unknown functions. The blood types of humans are due to variations in surface glycoproteins of erythrocytes. Disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary stomatocytosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nThe red blood cell membrane proteins organized according to their function:\n\nTransport\n* Band 3 – Anion transporter, also an important structural component of the erythrocyte cell membrane, makes up to 25% of the cell membrane surface, each red cell contains approximately one million copies. Defines the Diego Blood Group; \n* Aquaporin 1 – water transporter, defines the Colton Blood Group;\n* Glut1 – glucose and L-dehydroascorbic acid transporter;\n* Kidd antigen protein – urea transporter;\n* RhAG – gas transporter, probably of carbon dioxide, defines Rh Blood Group and the associated unusual blood group phenotype Rhnull;\n* Na+/K+ – ATPase;\n* Ca2+ – ATPase;\n* Na+ K+ 2Cl− – cotransporter;\n* Na+-Cl− – cotransporter;\n* Na-H exchanger;\n* K-Cl – cotransporter;\n* Gardos Channel.\n\nCell adhesion\n* ICAM-4 – interacts with integrins;\n* BCAM  – a glycoprotein that defines the Lutheran blood group and also known as  Lu or laminin-binding protein.\n\nStructural role – The following membrane proteins establish linkages with skeletal proteins and may play an important role in regulating cohesion between the lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, likely enabling the red cell to maintain its favorable membrane surface area by preventing the membrane from collapsing (vesiculating).\n* Ankyrin-based macromolecular complex – proteins linking the bilayer to the membrane skeleton through the interaction of their cytoplasmic domains with Ankyrin.\n** Band 3 – also assembles various glycolytic enzymes, the presumptive CO2 transporter, and carbonic anhydrase into a macromolecular complex termed a \"metabolon,\" which may play a key role in regulating red cell metabolism and ion and gas transport function);\n** RhAG – also involved in transport, defines associated unusual blood group phenotype Rhmod.\n* Protein 4.1R-based macromolecular complex – proteins interacting with Protein 4.1R.\n** Protein 4.1R – weak expression of Gerbich antigens;\n** Glycophorin C and D – glycoprotein, defines Gerbich Blood Group;\n** XK – defines the Kell Blood Group and the Mcleod unusual phenotype (lack of Kx antigen and greatly reduced expression of Kell antigens);\n** RhD/RhCE – defines Rh Blood Group and the associated unusual blood group phenotype Rhnull;\n** Duffy protein – has been proposed to be associated with chemokine clearance; \n** Adducin – interaction with band 3;\n** Dematin- interaction with the Glut1 glucose transporter.\n\nSurface electrostatic potential\n\nThe zeta potential is an electrochemical property of cell surfaces that is determined by the net electrical charge of molecules exposed at the surface of cell membranes of the cell. The normal zeta potential of the erythrocyte is −15.7 millivolts (mV).Tokumasu F, Ostera GR, Amaratunga C, Fairhurst RM (2012) Modifications in erythrocyte membrane zeta potential by Plasmodium falciparum infection. Exp Parasitol Much of this potential appears to be contributed by the exposed sialic acid residues in the membrane: their removal results in zeta potential of −6.06 mV.\n\nClinical notes\n\nSeparation and blood doping\n\nRed blood cells can be obtained from whole blood by centrifugation, which separates the cells from the blood plasma in a process known as blood fractionation. Packed red blood cells, which are made in this way from whole blood with the plasma removed, are used in transfusion medicine.  During plasma donation, the red blood cells are pumped back into the body right away and only the plasma is collected.\n\nSome athletes have tried to improve their performance by blood doping: first about 1 litre of their blood is extracted, then the red blood cells are isolated, frozen and stored, to be reinjected shortly before the competition. (Red blood cells can be conserved for 5 weeks at ) This practice is hard to detect but may endanger the human cardiovascular system which is not equipped to deal with blood of the resulting higher viscosity. Another method of blood doping involves injection with erythropoietin in order to stimulate production of red blood cells.  Both practices are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nArtificially grown red blood cells\n\nIn 2008 it was reported that human embryonic stem cells had been successfully coaxed into becoming erythrocytes in the lab. The difficult step was to induce the cells to eject their nucleus; this was achieved by growing the cells on stromal cells from the bone marrow. It is hoped that these artificial erythrocytes can eventually be used for blood transfusions. \n\nDiseases and diagnostic tools \n\nBlood diseases involving the red blood cells include:\n* Anemias (or anaemias) are diseases characterized by low oxygen transport capacity of the blood, because of low red cell count or some abnormality of the red blood cells or the hemoglobin.\n\n* Iron deficiency anemia is the most common anemia; it occurs when the dietary intake or absorption of iron is insufficient, and hemoglobin, which contains iron, cannot be formed\n\n* Sickle-cell disease is a genetic disease that results in abnormal hemoglobin molecules. When these release their oxygen load in the tissues, they become insoluble, leading to mis-shaped red blood cells. These sickle shaped red cells are less deformable and viscoelastic meaning that they have become rigid and can cause blood vessel blockage, pain, strokes, and other tissue damage.\n\n* Thalassemia is a genetic disease that results in the production of an abnormal ratio of hemoglobin subunits.\n\n*Hereditary spherocytosis syndromes are a group of inherited disorders characterized by defects in the red blood cell's cell membrane, causing the cells to be small, sphere-shaped, and fragile instead of donut-shaped and flexible. These abnormal red blood cells are destroyed by the spleen. Several other hereditary disorders of the red blood cell membrane are known. \n\n* Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease wherein the body lacks intrinsic factor, required to absorb vitamin B12 from food. Vitamin B12 is needed for the production of hemoglobin.\n\n* Aplastic anemia is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells.\n\n* Pure red cell aplasia is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce only red blood cells.\n\n* Hemolysis is the general term for excessive breakdown of red blood cells. It can have several causes and can result in hemolytic anemia.\n\n* The malaria parasite spends part of its life-cycle in red blood cells, feeds on their hemoglobin and then breaks them apart, causing fever. Both sickle-cell disease and thalassemia are more common in malaria areas, because these mutations convey some protection against the parasite.\n\n* Polycythemias (or erythrocytoses) are diseases characterized by a surplus of red blood cells. The increased viscosity of the blood can cause a number of symptoms.\n\n* In polycythemia vera the increased number of red blood cells results from an abnormality in the bone marrow.\n\n* Several microangiopathic diseases, including disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathies, present with pathognomonic (diagnostic) red blood cell fragments called schistocytes. These pathologies generate fibrin strands that sever red blood cells as they try to move past a thrombus.\n* Hemolytic transfusion reaction is the destruction of donated red blood cells after a transfusion, mediated by host antibodies, often as a result of a blood type mismatch.\n\nSeveral blood tests involve red blood cells, including the RBC count (the number of red blood cells per volume of blood), the hematocrit (percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Many diseases involving red blood cells are diagnosed with a blood film (or peripheral blood smear), where a thin layer of blood is smeared on a microscope slide. The blood type needs to be determined to prepare for a blood transfusion or an organ transplantation.",
                "Blood is a body fluid in animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. \n\nIn vertebrates, it is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma. Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume),  and contains dissipated proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves. Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), white blood cells (also called WBCs or leukocytes)  and platelets. The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as bicarbonate ion transported in plasma.\n\nVertebrate blood is bright red when its haemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated. Some animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen, instead of hemoglobin. Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system. In most insects, this \"blood\" does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen.\n\nJawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system, based largely on white blood cells. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are important in the clotting of blood. Arthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system.\n\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled.\n\nMedical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato- (also spelled haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word  (haima) for \"blood\". In terms of anatomy and histology, blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen.\n\nFunctions\n\nBlood performs many important functions within the body including:\n* Supply of oxygen to tissues (bound to hemoglobin, which is carried in red cells)\n* Supply of nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins (e.g., blood lipids))\n* Removal of waste such as carbon dioxide, urea, and lactic acid\n* Immunological functions, including circulation of white blood cells, and detection of foreign material by antibodies\n* Coagulation, the response to a broken blood vessel, the conversion of blood from a liquid to a semi-solid gel to stop bleeding\n* Messenger functions, including the transport of hormones and the signaling of tissue damage\n* Regulation of body pH\n* Regulation of core body temperature\n* Hydraulic functions\n\nConstituents\n\nBlood accounts for 7% of the human body weight,  with an average density of approximately 1060 kg/m3, very close to pure water's density of 1000 kg/m3.  The average adult has a blood volume of roughly 5 L, which is composed of plasma and several kinds of cells. These blood cells (which are also called corpuscles or \"formed elements\") consist of erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs), leukocytes (white blood cells), and thrombocytes (platelets). By volume, the red blood cells constitute about 45% of whole blood, the plasma about 54.3%, and white cells about 0.7%.\n\nWhole blood (plasma and cells) exhibits non-Newtonian fluid dynamics. If all human hemoglobin were free in the plasma rather than being contained in RBCs, the circulatory fluid would be too viscous for the cardiovascular system to function effectively.\n\nFile:Krew Frakcjonowana.jpg|Human blood fractioned by centrifugation. Plasma (upper, yellow layer), buffy coat (middle, thin white layer) and erythrocyte layer (bottom, red layer) can be seen.\nFile:Blutkreislauf.png|Blood circulation:Red oxygenated Blue \n deoxygenated\nFile:Blausen 0425 Formed Elements.png|Illustration depicting formed elements of blood.\nFile:Blut-EDTA.jpg|Two tubes of EDTA-anticoagulated blood. Left tube: after standing, the RBCs have settled at the bottom of the tube. Right tube: contains freshly drawn blood.\n\nCells\n\nOne microliter of blood contains:\n* 4.7 to 6.1 million (male), 4.2 to 5.4 million (female) erythrocytes:  Red blood cells contain the blood's hemoglobin and distribute oxygen. Mature red blood cells lack a nucleus and organelles in mammals. The red blood cells (together with endothelial vessel cells and other cells) are also marked by glycoproteins that define the different blood types. The proportion of blood occupied by red blood cells is referred to as the hematocrit, and is normally about 45%. The combined surface area of all red blood cells of the human body would be roughly 2,000 times as great as the body's exterior surface. \n* 4,000–11,000 leukocytes: White blood cells are part of the body's immune system; they destroy and remove old or aberrant cells and cellular debris, as well as attack infectious agents (pathogens) and foreign substances. The cancer of leukocytes is called leukemia.\n* 200,000–500,000 thrombocytes: Also called platelets, they take part in blood clotting (coagulation). Fibrin from the coagulation cascade creates a mesh over the platelet plug.\n\nPlasma\n\nAbout 55% of blood is blood plasma, a fluid that is the blood's liquid medium, which by itself is straw-yellow in color. The blood plasma volume totals of 2.7–3.0 liters (2.8–3.2 quarts) in an average human. It is essentially an aqueous solution containing 92% water, 8% blood plasma proteins, and trace amounts of other materials. Plasma circulates dissolved nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins), and removes waste products, such as carbon dioxide, urea, and lactic acid.\n\nOther important components include:\n* Serum albumin\n* Blood-clotting factors (to facilitate coagulation)\n* Immunoglobulins (antibodies)\n* lipoprotein particles\n* Various other proteins\n* Various electrolytes (mainly sodium and chloride)\n\nThe term serum refers to plasma from which the clotting proteins have been removed. Most of the proteins remaining are albumin and immunoglobulins.\n\npH values\n\nBlood pH is regulated to stay within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, making it slightly basic.   Blood that has a pH below 7.35 is too acidic, whereas blood pH above 7.45 is too basic. Blood pH, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), and HCO3− are carefully regulated by a number of homeostatic mechanisms, which exert their influence principally through the respiratory system and the urinary system in order to control the acid-base balance and respiration. An arterial blood gas test will measure these. Plasma also circulates hormones transmitting their messages to various tissues. The list of normal reference ranges for various blood electrolytes is extensive.\n\nBlood in non-mammalian vertebrates\n\nHuman blood is typical of that of mammals, although the precise details concerning cell numbers, size, protein structure, and so on, vary somewhat between species. In non-mammalian vertebrates, however, there are some key differences:\n* Red blood cells of non-mammalian vertebrates are flattened and ovoid in form, and retain their cell nuclei\n* There is considerable variation in the types and proportions of white blood cells; for example, acidophils are generally more common than in humans\n* Platelets are unique to mammals; in other vertebrates, small nucleated, spindle cells called thrombocytes are responsible for blood clotting instead\n\nPhysiology\n\nCardiovascular system\n\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In humans, blood is pumped from the strong left ventricle of the heart through arteries to peripheral tissues and returns to the right atrium of the heart through veins. It then enters the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism by cells, to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.\n\nAdditional return flow may be generated by the movement of skeletal muscles, which can compress veins and push blood through the valves in veins toward the right atrium.\n\nThe blood circulation was famously described by William Harvey in 1628. \n\nProduction and degradation of blood cells\n\nIn vertebrates, the various cells of blood are made in the bone marrow in a process called hematopoiesis, which includes erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells; and myelopoiesis, the production of white blood cells and platelets. During childhood, almost every human bone produces red blood cells; as adults, red blood cell production is limited to the larger bones: the bodies of the vertebrae, the breastbone (sternum), the ribcage, the pelvic bones, and the bones of the upper arms and legs. In addition, during childhood, the thymus gland, found in the mediastinum, is an important source of T lymphocytes. \nThe proteinaceous component of blood (including clotting proteins) is produced predominantly by the liver, while hormones are produced by the endocrine glands and the watery fraction is regulated by the hypothalamus and maintained by the kidney.\n\nHealthy erythrocytes have a plasma life of about 120 days before they are degraded by the spleen, and the Kupffer cells in the liver. The liver also clears some proteins, lipids, and amino acids. The kidney actively secretes waste products into the urine.\n\nOxygen transport\n\nAbout 98.5% of the oxygen in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human breathing air at sea-level pressure is chemically combined with the Hgb. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to Hgb. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in mammals and many other species (for exceptions, see below). Hemoglobin has an oxygen binding capacity of between 1.36 and 1.40 ml O2 per gram hemoglobin,  which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventyfold, compared to if oxygen solely were carried by its solubility of 0.03 ml O2 per liter blood per mm Hg partial pressure of oxygen (approximately 100 mm Hg in arteries).\n\nWith the exception of pulmonary and umbilical arteries and their corresponding veins, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and deliver it to the body via arterioles and capillaries, where the oxygen is consumed; afterwards, venules, and veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.\n\nUnder normal conditions in adult humans at rest; hemoglobin in blood leaving the lungs is about 98–99% saturated with oxygen, achieving an oxygen delivery of between 950 and 1150 ml/min[http://www.edwards.com/SiteCollectionImages/edwards/products/presep/ar04313hemodynpocketcard.pdf Edwards Lifesciences LLC - Normal Hemodynamic Parameters – Adult] 2009 to the body. In a healthy adult at rest, oxygen consumption is approximately 200 - 250 ml/min, and deoxygenated blood returning to the lungs is still approximately 75%   (70 to 78%) saturated. Increased oxygen consumption during sustained exercise reduces the oxygen saturation of venous blood, which can reach less than 15% in a trained athlete; although breathing rate and blood flow increase to compensate, oxygen saturation in arterial blood can drop to 95% or less under these conditions.  Oxygen saturation this low is considered dangerous in an individual at rest (for instance, during surgery under anesthesia). Sustained hypoxia (oxygenation of less than 90%), is dangerous to health, and severe hypoxia (saturations of less than 30%) may be rapidly fatal. \n\nA fetus, receiving oxygen via the placenta, is exposed to much lower oxygen pressures (about 21% of the level found in an adult's lungs), and, so, fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity for oxygen (hemoglobin F) in order to function under these conditions. \n\nCarbon dioxide transport\n\nCO2 is carried in blood in three different ways. (The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood). Most of it (about 70%) is converted to bicarbonate ions  by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells by the reaction CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 → H+ + ; about 7% is dissolved in the plasma; and about 23% is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds.  \nHemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the CO2 bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of allosteric effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of CO2 decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. The decreased binding to carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased oxygen levels is known as the Haldane effect, and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. A rise in the partial pressure of CO2 or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the Bohr effect.\n\nTransport of hydrogen ions\n\nSome oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin binds most of the hydrogen ions as it has a much greater affinity for more hydrogen than does oxyhemoglobin.\n\nLymphatic system\n\nIn mammals, blood is in equilibrium with lymph, which is continuously formed in tissues from blood by capillary ultrafiltration. Lymph is collected by a system of small lymphatic vessels and directed to the thoracic duct, which drains into the left subclavian vein where lymph rejoins the systemic blood circulation.\n\nThermoregulation\n\nBlood circulation transports heat throughout the body, and adjustments to this flow are an important part of thermoregulation. Increasing blood flow to the surface (e.g., during warm weather or strenuous exercise) causes warmer skin, resulting in faster heat loss. In contrast, when the external temperature is low, blood flow to the extremities and surface of the skin is reduced and to prevent heat loss and is circulated to the important organs of the body, preferentially.\n\nHydraulic functions\n\nThe restriction of blood flow can also be used in specialized tissues to cause engorgement, resulting in an erection of that tissue; examples are the erectile tissue in the penis and clitoris.\n\nAnother example of a hydraulic function is the jumping spider, in which blood forced into the legs under pressure causes them to straighten for a powerful jump, without the need for bulky muscular legs. \n\nInvertebrates\n\nIn insects, the blood (more properly called hemolymph) is not involved in the transport of oxygen. (Openings called tracheae allow oxygen from the air to diffuse directly to the tissues). Insect blood moves nutrients to the tissues and removes waste products in an open system.\n\nOther invertebrates use respiratory proteins to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity. Hemoglobin is the most common respiratory protein found in nature. Hemocyanin (blue) contains copper and is found in crustaceans and mollusks. It is thought that tunicates (sea squirts) might use vanabins (proteins containing vanadium) for respiratory pigment (bright-green, blue, or orange).\n\nIn many invertebrates, these oxygen-carrying proteins are freely soluble in the blood; in vertebrates they are contained in specialized red blood cells, allowing for a higher concentration of respiratory pigments without increasing viscosity or damaging blood filtering organs like the kidneys.\n\nGiant tube worms have unusual hemoglobins that allow them to live in extraordinary environments. These hemoglobins also carry sulfides normally fatal in other animals.\n\nColor\n\nThe coloring matter of blood (hemochrome) is largely due to the protein in the blood responsible for oxygen transport.  Different groups of organisms use different proteins.\n\nHemoglobin\n\nHemoglobin is the principal determinant of the color of blood in vertebrates. Each molecule has four heme groups, and their interaction with various molecules alters the exact color. In vertebrates and other hemoglobin-using creatures, arterial blood and capillary blood are bright red, as oxygen imparts a strong red color to the heme group. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red; this is present in veins, and can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. This is because the spectrum of light absorbed by hemoglobin differs between the oxygenated and deoxygenated states. \n\nBlood in carbon monoxide poisoning is bright red, because carbon monoxide causes the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. In cyanide poisoning, the body cannot utilize oxygen, so the venous blood remains oxygenated, increasing the redness. There are some conditions affecting the heme groups present in hemoglobin that can make the skin appear blue—a symptom called cyanosis. If the heme is oxidized, methaemoglobin, which is more brownish and cannot transport oxygen, is formed. In the rare condition sulfhemoglobinemia, arterial hemoglobin is partially oxygenated, and appears dark red with a bluish hue.\n\nVeins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons. However, the factors that contribute to this alteration of color perception are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and the processing of visual input by the visual cortex, rather than the actual color of the venous blood. \n\nSkinks in the genus Prasinohaema have green blood due to a buildup of the waste product biliverdin. \n\nHemocyanin\n\nThe blood of most mollusks – including cephalopods and gastropods – as well as some arthropods, such as horseshoe crabs, is blue, as it contains the copper-containing protein hemocyanin at concentrations of about 50 grams per liter. Hemocyanin is colorless when deoxygenated and dark blue when oxygenated. The blood in the circulation of these creatures, which generally live in cold environments with low oxygen tensions, is grey-white to pale yellow, and it turns dark blue when exposed to the oxygen in the air, as seen when they bleed. This is due to change in color of hemocyanin when it is oxidized. Hemocyanin carries oxygen in extracellular fluid, which is in contrast to the intracellular oxygen transport in mammals by hemoglobin in RBCs.\n\nChlorocruorin\n\nThe blood of most annelid worms and some marine polychaetes use chlorocruorin to transport oxygen.  It is green in color in dilute solutions.Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, The Handy Science Answer Book, p. 465, Visible Ink Press, 2011 ISBN 1578593212.\n\nHemerythrin\n\nHemerythrin is used for oxygen transport in the marine invertebrates sipunculids, priapulids, brachiopods, and the annelid worm, magelona.  Hemerythrin is violet-pink when oxygenated.\n\nHemovanadin\n\nThe blood of some species of ascidians and tunicates, also known as sea squirts, contains proteins called vanadins. These proteins are based on vanadium, and give the creatures a concentration of vanadium in their bodies 100 times higher than the surrounding sea water. Unlike hemocyanin and hemoglobin, hemovanadin is not an oxygen carrier. When exposed to oxygen, however, vanadins turn a mustard yellow.\n\nPathology\n\nGeneral medical disorders\n\n* Disorders of volume\n** Injury can cause blood loss through bleeding.  A healthy adult can lose almost 20% of blood volume (1 L) before the first symptom, restlessness, begins, and 40% of volume (2 L) before shock sets in. Thrombocytes are important for blood coagulation and the formation of blood clots, which can stop bleeding. Trauma to the internal organs or bones can cause internal bleeding, which can sometimes be severe.\n** Dehydration can reduce the blood volume by reducing the water content of the blood. This would rarely result in shock (apart from the very severe cases) but may result in orthostatic hypotension and fainting.\n* Disorders of circulation\n** Shock is the ineffective perfusion of tissues, and can be caused by a variety of conditions including blood loss, infection, poor cardiac output.\n** Atherosclerosis reduces the flow of blood through arteries, because atheroma lines arteries and narrows them. Atheroma tends to increase with age, and its progression can be compounded by many causes including smoking, high blood pressure, excess circulating lipids (hyperlipidemia), and diabetes mellitus.\n** Coagulation can form a thrombosis, which can obstruct vessels.\n** Problems with blood composition, the pumping action of the heart, or narrowing of blood vessels can have many consequences including hypoxia (lack of oxygen) of the tissues supplied. The term ischemia refers to tissue that is inadequately perfused with blood, and infarction refers to tissue death (necrosis), which can occur when the blood supply has been blocked (or is very inadequate)\n\nHematological disorders\n\n* Anemia\n** Insufficient red cell mass (anemia) can be the result of bleeding, blood disorders like thalassemia, or nutritional deficiencies; and may require blood transfusion. Several countries have blood banks to fill the demand for transfusable blood. A person receiving a blood transfusion must have a blood type compatible with that of the donor.\n** Sickle-cell anemia\n* Disorders of cell proliferation\n** Leukemia is a group of cancers of the blood-forming tissues and cells.\n** Non-cancerous overproduction of red cells (polycythemia vera) or platelets (essential thrombocytosis) may be premalignant.\n** Myelodysplastic syndromes involve ineffective production of one or more cell lines.\n* Disorders of coagulation\n** Hemophilia is a genetic illness that causes dysfunction in one of the blood's clotting mechanisms. This can allow otherwise inconsequential wounds to be life-threatening, but more commonly results in hemarthrosis, or bleeding into joint spaces, which can be crippling.\n** Ineffective or insufficient platelets can also result in coagulopathy (bleeding disorders).\n** Hypercoagulable state (thrombophilia) results from defects in regulation of platelet or clotting factor function, and can cause thrombosis.\n* Infectious disorders of blood\n** Blood is an important vector of infection. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is transmitted through contact with blood, semen or other body secretions of an infected person. Hepatitis B and C are transmitted primarily through blood contact. Owing to blood-borne infections, bloodstained objects are treated as a biohazard.\n** Bacterial infection of the blood is bacteremia or sepsis. Viral Infection is viremia. Malaria and trypanosomiasis are blood-borne parasitic infections.\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning\n\nSubstances other than oxygen can bind to hemoglobin; in some cases this can cause irreversible damage to the body. Carbon monoxide, for example, is extremely dangerous when carried to the blood via the lungs by inhalation, because carbon monoxide irreversibly binds to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, so that less hemoglobin is free to bind oxygen, and fewer oxygen molecules can be transported throughout the blood. This can cause suffocation insidiously. A fire burning in an enclosed room with poor ventilation presents a very dangerous hazard, since it can create a build-up of carbon monoxide in the air. Some carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin when smoking tobacco.\n\nMedical treatments\n\nBlood products\n\nBlood for transfusion is obtained from human donors by blood donation and stored in a blood bank. There are many different blood types in humans, the ABO blood group system, and the Rhesus blood group system being the most important. Transfusion of blood of an incompatible blood group may cause severe, often fatal, complications, so crossmatching is done to ensure that a compatible blood product is transfused.\n\nOther blood products administered intravenously are platelets, blood plasma, cryoprecipitate, and specific coagulation factor concentrates.\n\nIntravenous administration\n\nMany forms of medication (from antibiotics to chemotherapy) are administered intravenously, as they are not readily or adequately absorbed by the digestive tract.\n\nAfter severe acute blood loss, liquid preparations, generically known as plasma expanders, can be given intravenously, either solutions of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 etc.) at physiological concentrations, or colloidal solutions, such as dextrans, human serum albumin, or fresh frozen plasma. In these emergency situations, a plasma expander is a more effective life-saving procedure than a blood transfusion, because the metabolism of transfused red blood cells does not restart immediately after a transfusion.\n\nBloodletting\n\nIn modern evidence-based medicine, bloodletting is used in management of a few rare diseases, including hemochromatosis and polycythemia. However, bloodletting and leeching were common unvalidated interventions used until the 19th century, as many diseases were incorrectly thought to be due to an excess of blood, according to Hippocratic medicine.\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \"blood\" dates to the oldest English, circa 1000 CE. The word is derived from Middle English, which is derived from the Old English word blôd, which is akin to the Old High German word bluot, meaning blood. The modern German word is (das) Blut.\n\nClassical Greek medicine\n\nFåhræus (a Swedish physician who devised the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) suggested that the Ancient Greek system of humorism, wherein the body was thought to contain four distinct bodily fluids (associated with different temperaments), were based upon the observation of blood clotting in a transparent container. When blood is drawn in a glass container and left undisturbed for about an hour, four different layers can be seen. A dark clot forms at the bottom (the \"black bile\"). Above the clot is a layer of red blood cells (the \"blood\"). Above this is a whitish layer of white blood cells (the \"phlegm\"). The top layer is clear yellow serum (the \"yellow bile\"). \n\nHuman blood\n\nThe ABO blood group system was discovered in the year 1900 by Karl Landsteiner. Jan Janský is credited with the first classification of blood into the four types (A, B, AB, and O) in 1907, which remains in use today. In 1907 the first blood transfusion was performed that used the ABO system to predict compatibility.  The first non-direct transfusion was performed on March 27, 1914. The Rhesus factor was discovered in 1937.\n\nCultural and religious beliefs\n\nDue to its importance to life, blood is associated with a large number of beliefs. One of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol for family relationships through birth/parentage; to be \"related by blood\" is to be related by ancestry or descendance, rather than marriage. This bears closely to bloodlines, and sayings such as \"blood is thicker than water\" and \"bad blood\", as well as \"Blood brother\".\n\nBlood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions, because Leviticus 17:11 says \"the life of a creature is in the blood.\" This phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood or eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off.\n\nMythic references to blood can sometimes be connected to the life-giving nature of blood, seen in such events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death.\n\nIndigenous Australians\n\nIn many indigenous Australian Aboriginal peoples' traditions, ochre (particularly red) and blood, both high in iron content and considered Maban, are applied to the bodies of dancers for ritual. As Lawlor states:\nIn many Aboriginal rituals and ceremonies, red ochre is rubbed all over the naked bodies of the dancers. In secret, sacred male ceremonies, blood extracted from the veins of the participant's arms is exchanged and rubbed on their bodies. Red ochre is used in similar ways in less-secret ceremonies. Blood is also used to fasten the feathers of birds onto people's bodies. Bird feathers contain a protein that is highly magnetically sensitive.  Lawlor comments that blood employed in this fashion is held by these peoples to attune the dancers to the invisible energetic realm of the Dreamtime. Lawlor then connects these invisible energetic realms and magnetic fields, because iron is magnetic.\n\nEuropean paganism\n\nAmong the Germanic tribes, blood was used during their sacrifices; the Blóts. The blood was considered to have the power of its originator, and, after the butchering, the blood was sprinkled on the walls, on the statues of the gods, and on the participants themselves. This act of sprinkling blood was called blóedsian in Old English, and the terminology was borrowed by the Roman Catholic Church becoming to bless and blessing. The Hittite word for blood, ishar was a cognate to words for \"oath\" and \"bond\", see Ishara.\nThe Ancient Greeks believed that the blood of the gods, ichor, was a substance that was poisonous to mortals.\n\nAs a relic of Germanic Law, the cruentation, an ordeal where the corpse of the victim was supposed to start bleeding in the presence of the murderer, was used until the early 17th century.\n\nChristianity\n\nIn Genesis 9:4, God prohibited Noah and his sons from eating blood (see Noahide Law). This command continued to be observed by the Eastern Orthodox.\n\nIt is also found in the Bible that when the Angel of Death came around to the Hebrew house that the first-born child would not die if the angel saw lamb's blood wiped across the doorway.\n\nAt the Council of Jerusalem, the apostles prohibited certain Christians from consuming blood—this is documented in Acts 15:20 and 29. This chapter specifies a reason (especially in verses 19-21): It was to avoid offending Jews who had become Christians, because the Mosaic Law Code prohibited the practice.\n\nChrist's blood is the means for the atonement of sins. Also, ″… the blood of Jesus Christ his [God] Son cleanseth us from all sin.\" (1 John 1:7), “… Unto him [God] that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.\" (Revelation 1:5), and \"And they overcame him (Satan) by the blood\nof the Lamb [Jesus the Christ], and by the word of their testimony …” (Revelation 12:11).\n\nSome Christian churches, including Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Assyrian Church of the East teach that, when consecrated, the Eucharistic wine actually becomes the blood of Jesus for worshippers to drink. Thus in the consecrated wine, Jesus becomes spiritually and physically present. This teaching is rooted in the Last Supper, as written in the four gospels of the Bible, in which Jesus stated to his disciples that the bread that they ate was his body, and the wine was his blood. \"This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.\" ().\n\nMost forms of Protestantism, especially those of a Wesleyan or Presbyterian lineage, teach that the wine is no more than a symbol of the blood of Christ, who is spiritually but not physically present. Lutheran theology teaches that the body and blood is present together \"in, with, and under\" the bread and wine of the Eucharistic feast.\n\nJudaism\n\nIn Judaism, animal blood may not be consumed even in the smallest quantity (Leviticus 3:17 and elsewhere); this is reflected in Jewish dietary laws (Kashrut). Blood is purged from meat by rinsing and soaking in water (to loosen clots), salting and then rinsing with water again several times.  Eggs must also be checked and any blood spots removed before consumption.  Although blood from fish is Biblically kosher, it is rabbinically forbidden to consume fish blood to avoid the appearance of breaking the Biblical prohibition. \n\nAnother ritual involving blood involves the covering of the blood of fowl and game after slaughtering (Leviticus 17:13); the reason given by the Torah is: \"Because the life of the animal is [in] its blood\" (ibid 17:14). In relation to human beings, Kabbalah expounds on this verse that the animal soul of a person is in the blood, and that physical desires stem from it.\n\nLikewise, the mystical reason for salting temple sacrifices and slaughtered meat is to remove the blood of animal-like passions from the person. By removing the animal's blood, the animal energies and life-force contained in the blood are removed, making the meat fit for human consumption. \n\nIslam\n\nConsumption of food containing blood is forbidden by Islamic dietary laws. This is derived from the statement in the Qur'an, sura Al-Ma'ida (5:3): \"Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah.\"\n\nBlood is considered unclean, hence there are specific methods to obtain physical and ritual status of cleanliness once bleeding has occurred. Specific rules and prohibitions apply to menstruation, postnatal bleeding and irregular vaginal bleeding. When an animal has been slaughtered, the animal's  neck is cut in a way to ensure that the spine is not severed, hence the brain may send commands to the heart to pump blood to it for oxygen. In this way, blood is removed from the body, and the meat is generally now safe to cook and eat. In modern times, blood transfusions are generally not considered against the rules.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses\n\nBased on their interpretation of scriptures such as Acts 15:28, 29 (\"Keep abstaining...from blood.\"), Jehovah's Witnesses neither consume blood nor accept transfusions of whole blood or its major components: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (thrombocytes), and plasma. Members may personally decide whether they will accept medical procedures that involve their own blood or substances that are further fractionated from the four major components. \n\nEast Asian culture\n\nIn south East Asian popular culture, it is often said that if a man's nose produces a small flow of blood, he is experiencing sexual desire. This often appears in Chinese-language and Hong Kong films as well as in Japanese and Korean culture parodied in anime, manga, and drama. Characters, mostly males, will often be shown with a nosebleed if they have just seen someone nude or in little clothing, or if they have had an erotic thought or fantasy; this is based on the idea that a male's blood pressure will spike dramatically when aroused. \n\nVampire legends\n\nVampires are mythical creatures that drink blood directly for sustenance, usually with a preference for human blood. Cultures all over the world have myths of this kind; for example the 'Nosferatu' legend, a human who achieves damnation and immortality by drinking the blood of others, originates from Eastern European folklore. Ticks, leeches, female mosquitoes, vampire bats, and an assortment of other natural creatures do consume the blood of other animals, but only bats are associated with vampires. This has no relation to vampire bats, which are new world creatures discovered well after the origins of the European myths.\n\nApplications\n\nIn the applied sciences\n\nBlood residue can help forensic investigators identify weapons, reconstruct a criminal action, and link suspects to the crime. Through bloodstain pattern analysis, forensic information can also be gained from the spatial distribution of bloodstains.\n\nBlood residue analysis is also a technique used in archeology.\n\nIn art\n\nBlood is one of the body fluids that has been used in art.  In particular, the performances of Viennese Actionist Hermann Nitsch, Istvan Kantor, Franko B, Lennie Lee, Ron Athey, Yang Zhichao, Lucas Abela and Kira O' Reilly, along with the photography of Andres Serrano, have incorporated blood as a prominent visual element. Marc Quinn has made sculptures using frozen blood, including a cast of his own head made using his own blood.\n\nIn genealogy and family history\n\nThe term blood is used in genealogical circles to refer to one's ancestry, origins, and ethnic background as in the word bloodline. Other terms where blood is used in a family history sense are blue-blood, royal blood, mixed-blood and blood relative."

                "A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking.  Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. \n\nThe film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay in the boundaries of the film's budget. There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.\n\nResponsibility\n\nFilm directors create an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized/noticed.  Realizing this vision includes overseeing the artistic and technical elements of film production, as well as directing the shooting timetable and meeting deadlines.  This entails organizing the film crew in such a way as to achieve their vision of the film.   This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set.  Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew,  thus, excellent communication skills are a must. \n\nSince the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she or it or they also needs/need to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary.  Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film. The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as \"a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure\".   It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again.  Omnipresent are the boundaries of the films budget.  Additionally, the director may also have to ensure an intended age rating.   Theoretically the sole superior of a director is the studio that is financing the film,  however a poor working relationship between a film director and an actor could possibly result in the director being replaced if the actor is a major film star.  Even so, it is arguable that the director spends more time on a project than anyone else, considering that the director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one.  It has been said that \"20-hour days are not unusual\".\n\nUnder European Union law, the film director is considered the \"author\" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory. Auteur theory is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary \"auteur\" (the French word for \"author\"). In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.\n\nCareer pathways\n\nSome film directors started as screenwriters, film editors or actors.  Several American cinematographers have become directors, including Barry Sonnenfeld, originally the Coen brothers' DP; Jan de Bont, cinematographer on films as Die Hard and Basic Instinct, directed Speed and Twister. Recently Wally Pfister, cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's three Batman films made his directorial debut with Transcendence. Other film directors have attended a film school to \"get formal training and education in their craft\".   Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film.  This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, and reading scripts.  Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities.  Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production.  A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying.  Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment. The National Film School of Denmark has the student's final projects presented on national TV.  Some film schools retain the rights for their students' works.  Many directors successfully prepared for making feature films by working in television.  The German Film and Television Academy Berlin consequently cooperates with the Berlin/Brandenburg TV station RBB (Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting) and ARTE. \n\nA handful of top directors made from $13 million to $257 million in 2011, such as James Cameron and Steven Spielberg.

                "Million Dollar Baby is a 2004 American sports drama film directed, co-produced and scored by Clint Eastwood, and starring Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. This film is about an underappreciated boxing trainer, the mistakes that haunt him from his past, and his quest for atonement by helping an underdog amateur boxer achieve her dream of becoming a professional.\n\nMillion Dollar Baby opened to wide acclaim from critics, and won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Its screenplay was written by Paul Haggis, based on short stories by F.X. Toole, the pen name of fight manager and \"cutman\" Jerry Boyd. Originally published under the title Rope Burns, the stories have since been republished under the film's title.\n\nPlot\n\nMargaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald, a waitress from a Missouri town in the Ozarks, shows up in the Hit Pit, a run-down Los Angeles gym  owned and operated by Frankie Dunn, an old, cantankerous boxing trainer. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he initially refuses. Maggie works out tirelessly each day in his gym, even after Frankie tells her she's \"too old\" to begin a boxing career at her age. Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris, Frankie's friend and employee—and the film's narrator—encourages and helps her.\n\nFrankie's prize prospect, \"Big\" Willie Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Dunn's rejecting offers for a championship bout. With prodding from Scrap and impressed with her persistence, Frankie reluctantly agrees to train Maggie. He warns her that he will teach her only the basics and then find her a manager. Other than Maggie and his employees, the only person Frankie has contact with is a local pastor, with whom he spars verbally at daily Mass.\n\nBefore her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to her dismay; upon being told by Scrap that said manager deliberately put her up against his best girl (coaching the novice to lose) to give her an easy win, Frankie rejoins Maggie in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory. A natural, she fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching, winning many of her lightweight bouts with first-round knockouts. Earning a reputation for her KOs, Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her.\n\nEventually, Frankie risks putting her in the junior welterweight class, where her nose is broken in her first match. Frankie comes to establish a paternal bond with Maggie, who substitutes for his estranged daughter. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for her with Mickey Mack at a diner on her 33rd birthday. Out of loyalty, she declines. Frankie begrudgingly accepts a fight for her against a top-ranked opponent in the UK, where he bestows a Gaelic nickname on her. The two travel Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but she berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.\n\nFrankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in Las Vegas, Nevada against the WBA women's welterweight champion, Billie \"The Blue Bear\", a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as a dirty fighter. Overcoming a shaky start, Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but after a round has ended, Billie knocks her out with an illegal sucker punch from behind after the bell has sounded to indicate the end of the round. Before Frankie can pull the corner stool out of the way which was inappropriately placed on its side by Frankie's assistant, Maggie lands hard on it, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic.\n\nFrankie is shown experiencing the first three of the five stages of grief: first seeking multiple doctors' opinions in denial, then blaming Scrap in anger and later trying to bargain with God through prayer.\n\nIn a medical rehabilitation facility, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family, but they arrive accompanied by an attorney and only after having first visited Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood; their only concern is to transfer Maggie's assets to them. She orders them to leave, threatening to sell the house and inform the IRS of her mother's welfare fraud if they ever show their faces again.\n\nAs the days pass, however, Maggie develops bedsores and undergoes an amputation for an infected leg. She asks a favor of Frankie: to help her die, declaring that she got everything she wanted out of life. A horrified Frankie refuses, and Maggie later bites her tongue repeatedly in an attempt to bleed to death, but the medical staff saves her and takes measures to prevent further suicide attempts. The pastor Frankie has harassed for 23 years, Father Horvak, warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's wishes.\n\nFrankie sneaks in one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of adrenaline, he finally tells Maggie the meaning of a nickname he gave her, Mo Chuisle (spelled incorrectly in the film as \"mo cuishle\"): Irish for \"my darling, and my blood\" (literally, \"my pulse\"). He never returns to the gym. Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's true character. The last shot of the film shows Frankie sitting at the counter of a diner where Maggie once took him.\n\nCast\n\n* Clint Eastwood as Frankie Dunn, a gruff but well-meaning elderly boxing trainer.\n* Hilary Swank as Mary Margaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald, a determined, aspiring boxer trained up by Frankie Dunn.\n* Morgan Freeman as Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris, Dunn's gym assistant; an elderly former boxer, he was blinded in one eye in his 109th, and last, fight.\n* Jay Baruchel as Dangerous Dillard Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch or \"Danger\", a simple-minded would-be boxer.\n* Mike Colter as \"Big\" Willie Little, a boxer whom Dunn has trained for years.\n* Lucia Rijker as Billie \"The Blue Bear\" Osterman, a vicious, ex-prostitute boxer.\n* Brían F.

Several studios rejected the project even when Eastwood signed on as actor and director. Even Warner Bros., Eastwood's longtime home base, would not agree to a US$30 million budget. Eastwood persuaded Lakeshore Entertainment's Tom Rosenberg to put up half the budget (as well as handle foreign distribution), with Warner Bros. contributing the rest ($15 million). Eastwood shot the film in less than 40 days between June and July 2004. Filming took place in Los Angeles and film sets at Warner Bros. Studios. The term 'Million Dollar Baby' was from a nose art on a World War II Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber. Eastwood had his daughter Morgan Colette appear in a brief role as a girl who waves to Swank's character at a gas station.  \n\nEastwood had confidence in Swank's acting background, but upon seeing Swank's small physique, he had concerns, \"I just thought, 'Yeah, this gal would be great. If we can get her trained up. If we can get a little bit more bulk on her, to make her look like a fighter'...She was like a feather. But what happened is, she had this great work ethic.\"\n\nConsequently, to prepare for her role, Swank underwent extensive training in the ring and weight room gaining 19 pounds of muscle, aided by professional trainer Grant L Roberts.  She trained for nearly five hours every day, winding up with potentially life-threatening staphylococcus infection.  She did not tell Eastwood about the infection because she thought it would be out of character for Maggie.\n\nBox office\n\nMillion Dollar Baby initially had a limited release, opening in eight theaters in December 2004.  In its later wide release opening, the film earned $12,265,482 in North America and quickly became a box-office hit both domestically and internationally. It grossed $216,763,646 in theaters; $100,492,203 in the United States, and $116,271,443 overseas. The film played in theaters for six and a half months.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe film received critical acclaim, with a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes  and an 86 out of 100 score on Metacritic, meaning \"universal acclaim\".  Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film four stars and stated that \"Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece, pure and simple,\" listing it as the best film of 2004.  Michael Medved stated: \"My main objection to Million Dollar Baby always centered on its misleading marketing, and effort by Warner Brothers to sell it as a movie about a female Rocky, with barely a hint of the pitch-dark substance that led Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer . . . to declare that 'no movie in my memory has depressed me more than Million Dollar Baby.'\" \n\nIn early 2005, the film sparked controversy when some disability rights activists protested the ending. Wesley J. Smith in The Weekly Standard also criticized the film for its ending and for missed opportunities; Smith said, \"The movie could have ended with Maggie triumphing once again, perhaps having obtained an education and becoming a teacher; or, opening a business managing boxers; or perhaps, receiving a standing ovation as an inspirational speaker.\" \n\nEastwood responded to the criticism by saying the film was about the American dream.  In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Eastwood distanced himself from the actions of characters in his films, noting, \"I've gone around in movies blowing people away with a .44 Magnum. But that doesn't mean I think that's a proper thing to do\".  Roger Ebert stated that \"a movie is not good or bad because of its content, but because of how it handles its content. Million Dollar Baby is classical in the clean, clear, strong lines of its story and characters, and had an enormous emotional impact\".\n\nSome commentators criticized the fact that the phrase mo chuisle, a term of endearment meaning literally \"my pulse\", and generally \"my darling\", was misspelled in the film as Mo Cuishle, as shown on the back of Maggie's robe. It is translated in the film as \"my darling, my blood\", although an Irish Gaelic translation site states that it is always translated as \"pulse\", not as \"blood\".  The original phrase is short for a chuisle mo chroí, meaning \"O pulse of my heart\".Wes Davis [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/opinion/26davis.html?ex\n1267160400&en63b9bdbd40e19929&ei\n5090&partnerrssuserland Fighting Words]. New York Times, 26 February 2005 The film has been praised, however, for stirring renewed interest in the Irish language in the U.S.\n\n\"Spoiler\" debate\n\nMultiple critics found a plot twist in the film to be particularly significant in discussion of the film's merits, and therefore wrote it was difficult to write proper reviews of the film. When describing the plot of the film, Ebert gave a spoiler warning.  He noted in his reviews the difficulty of discussing the film without discussing details of the plot, saying that even warning about spoilers would itself be a spoiler.  Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today said the film \"packs a surprise plot twist\" and said \"spoilsports already have begun to leak details about this drama\", saying \"the urge to divulge the story's secrets will only grow worse when the film finally goes nationwide.\" Wloszczyna noted that David Thomson of The Independent \"offered readers only a hint of the story basics\" and said \"most reviewers have coddled the sports saga with similar care...\" Wloszczyna quoted Thomson as saying, \"My great wish always, which is difficult to achieve, is to go in knowing nothing about a film.\" \n\nJeffrey Overstreet of Christianity Today avoided revealing plot details, stating that while knowing the nature of the third part would not ruin the film, it would alter the experience significantly.  Mark Moring of Christianity Today said, \"Who wants to watch a movie when you know how it ends? We've actually had to wrestle with that question around here lately...\" Moring said, \"We wondered if our 'moral obligation' to warn Christians about the potentially disturbing subject matter somehow 'trumped' our professional commitment to avoid plot spoilers—especially the worst plot spoiler of all: divulging the end. After some discussion, we agreed that the right decision was to not give away the end to Million Dollar Baby.\" \n\nMichael Atkinson of The Village Voice said the film had a \"spoiler-spawning shift in narrative.\"  Ian Grey of Baltimore City Paper said the last act seems to be from another film at first, and said \"Naming this misfortune and its consequences, however, would be an unforgivable spoiler.\" \n\nAccolades\n\nMillion Dollar Baby received the award for Best Picture of 2004 at the 77th Academy Awards. Clint Eastwood was awarded his second Best Director Oscar for the film, and also received a Best Actor in a Leading Role nomination. Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman received Best Actress in a Leading Role and Best Actor in a Supporting Role Oscars, respectively. Joel Cox, Eastwood's editor for many years, was nominated for Best Film Editing, and Paul Haggis was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay award.\n\nHome media\n\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on July 12, 2005, and all editions of the Region 1 DVD, except for the \"Deluxe Edition\", came with a paperback copy of the book Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner. An HD DVD release was issued on April 18, 2006.  The Blu-ray Disc version was released on November 14, 2006.  It was the first Best Picture winner released on either high-definition optical disc format in the U.S.; it and Unforgiven were the only ones released in the U.S. on HD DVD prior to the first one released in the U.S. on Blu-ray, Crash."

                "Mauritius (; ), officially the Republic of Mauritius (), is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 2000 km off the southeast coast of the African continent. The country includes the island of Mauritius, Rodrigues [560 km east], and the outer islands (Agaléga, St. Brandon and two disputed territories). The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues (172 km southwest) form part of the Mascarene Islands, along with nearby Réunion, a French overseas department. The area of the country is 2,040 km2. The capital and largest city is Port Louis.\n\nThe island of Mauritius was visited during the Middle Ages by the Arabs and then by the Portuguese, who named it Dina Arobi and Cirne, respectively. The island was uninhabited until the Dutch Republic established a colony in 1638, with the Dutch naming the island after Prince Maurice van Nassau. The Dutch colony was abandoned in 1710, and, five years later, the island became a French colony and was named Isle de France. Due to its strategic position, Mauritius was known as the \"star and key\" of the Indian Ocean. \n\nMauritius became an important base on the trade routes from Europe to the East before the opening of the Suez Canal and was involved in the long power struggle between the French and the British. The French won the Battle of Grand Port, their only naval victory over the British during these wars, but they could not prevent the British from landing at Cap Malheureux three months later. They formally surrendered on the fifth day of the invasion, 3 December 1810, on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property, the use of the French language, and the law of France in criminal and civil matters. Under British rule, the island became the Empire's main sugar-producing colony. In the 20th century, movements to improve labour laws and introduce political reforms began to be organized, a process that accelerated after World War II. The country became an independent state on 12 March 1968, following the adoption of a new constitution. In 1992, Mauritius became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nThe sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago is disputed between Mauritius and the United Kingdom (UK). The UK excised the archipelago from Mauritian territory prior to Mauritian independence in 1965. It gradually depopulated the archipelago's indigenous population and leased its biggest island, Diego Garcia, to the United States. Mauritius also claims sovereignty over Tromelin Island from France.\n\nThe people of Mauritius are multiethnic, multi-religious, multicultural and multilingual. The island's government is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system, and Mauritius is highly ranked for democracy and for economic and political freedom. Along with the other Mascarene Islands, Mauritius is known for its varied flora and fauna, with many species endemic to the island. The island is widely known as the only known home of the dodo, which, along with several other avian species, was made extinct by human activities relatively shortly after the island's settlement.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe first historical evidence of the existence of an island now known as Mauritius is on a map produced by the Italian cartographer Alberto Cantino in 1502.   From this, it appears that Mauritius was first named Dina Arobi during the Middle Ages by Arab sailors, the first people to visit the island.\n\nIn 1507 Portuguese sailors visited the uninhabited island. The island appears with a Portuguese name Cirne on early Portuguese maps, probably from the name of a ship in the 1507 expedition. Another Portuguese sailor, Dom Pedro Mascarenhas, gave the name Mascarenes to the Archipelago.\n\nIn 1598 a Dutch squadron under Admiral Wybrand van Warwyck landed at Grand Port and named the island Mauritius, in honour of Prince Maurice van Nassau, stadholder of the Dutch Republic. Later the island became a French colony and was renamed Isle de France. On 3 December 1810 the French surrendered the island during the Napoleonic Wars. Under British rule, the island's name reverted to Mauritius. Mauritius is also commonly known as Maurice and Île Maurice in French, Moris in Mauritian Creole.\n\nHistory\n\nThe island of Mauritius was uninhabited before its first recorded visit during the Middle Ages by Arab sailors, who named it Dina Arobi. However, the island might have been visited well before by sailors of ancient times; wax tablets were found on the shores of Mauritius by the Dutch, but since the tablets were not preserved, it cannot be said whether they were of Greek or Phoenician or Arabic origin.A short History of Mauritius, P.J. Barnwell & A. Toussaint\n\nIn 1507 Portuguese sailors came to the uninhabited island and established a visiting base. Diogo Fernandes Pereira, a Portuguese navigator, was the first European known to land in Mauritius. He named the island \"Ilha do Cirne\". The Portuguese did not stay long as they were not interested in these islands. \n\nDutch Mauritius (1638–1710)\n\nIn 1598 a Dutch squadron under Admiral Wybrand Van Warwyck landed at Grand Port and named the island \"Mauritius\" after Prince Maurice van Nassau of the Dutch Republic, the ruler of his country. The Dutch established a small colony on the island in 1638, from which they exploited ebony trees and introduced sugar cane, domestic animals and deer. It was from here that Dutch navigator Abel Tasman set out to discover the western part of Australia. The first Dutch settlement lasted twenty years. Several attempts were subsequently made  but the settlements never developed enough to produce dividends, leading to the Dutch to abandon Mauritius in 1710. \n\nFrench Mauritius (1715–1810)\n\nFrance, which already controlled neighbouring Île Bourbon (now Réunion), took control of Mauritius in 1715 and renamed it Isle de France. The 1735 arrival of French governor Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais coincided with development of a prosperous economy based on sugar production. Mahé de La Bourdonnais established Port Louis as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre.\n\nUnder his governorship, numerous buildings were erected, a number of which are still standing today. These include part of Government House, the Château de Mon Plaisir, and the Line Barracks, the headquarters of the police force. The island was under the administration of the French East India Company which maintained its presence until 1767.\n\nFrom 1767 to 1810, except for a brief period during the French Revolution when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France, the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French Government. Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre lived on the island from 1768 to 1771, then went back to France, where he  wrote Paul et Virginie, a love story, which made the Isle de France famous wherever the French language was spoken. Two famous French governors were the Vicomte de Souillac (who constructed the Chaussée in Port LouisPort Louis, A tropical City, Auguste Toussaint. ISBN 0 04 969001 9 and encouraged farmers to settle in the district of Savanne) and Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux (who saw to it that the French in the Indian Ocean should have their headquarters in Mauritius instead of Pondicherry in India).\n\nCharles Mathieu Isidore Decaen was a successful general in the French Revolutionary Wars and, in some ways, a rival of Napoléon I. He ruled as Governor of Isle de France and Réunion from 1803 to 1810. British naval cartographer and explorer Matthew Flinders was arrested and detained by the General Decaen on the island, in contravention of an order from Napoléon. During the Napoleonic Wars, Mauritius became a base from which French corsairs organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810, when a Royal Navy expedition led by Commodore Josias Rowley, R.N., an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, was sent to capture the island. Despite winning the Battle of Grand Port, the only French naval victory over the British during these wars, the French could not prevent the British from landing at Cap Malheureux three months later. They formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion, 3 December 1810, on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property and to use the French language and law of France in criminal and civil matters. Under British rule, the island's name reverted to Mauritius.\n\nBritish Mauritius (1810–1968)\n\nThe British administration, which began with Sir Robert Farquhar as Governor, led to rapid social and economic changes. However, it was tainted by the Ratsitatane episode. Ratsitatane, nephew of King Radama of Madagascar, was brought to Mauritius as a political prisoner. He managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free all the slaves on the island. But he was  betrayed by one of his associates and was caught by the British forces, summarily judged, and condemned to death. He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822, and his head was exposed to serve as deterrent against any future uprising among the slaves. \n\nIn 1832, Adrien d'Épinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper (Le Cernéen) which was not controlled by the government. In the same year, there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners. This gave rise to discontent, and to check an eventual rebellion, the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms. Furthermore, a stone fortress, Fort Adelaide, was built on a hill (now known as the Citadel hill) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising.\n\nSlavery was abolished in 1835, and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The abolition of slavery had important impacts on Mauritius' society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of indentured labourers from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 Indian soldiers to the island. Aapravasi Ghat, in the bay at Port Louis and now a UNESCO site, was the first British colony to serve as a major reception centre for slaves and indentured servants for British plantation labour.\n\nAn important figure of the 19th century was Rémy Ollier, a brilliant journalist of mixed origin. In 1828, the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius but British governors gave little power to coloured persons, and appointed only whites as leading officials.  Rémy Ollier petitioned to Queen Victoria so that coloureds also might become members in the council of government, and this became possible a few years later. He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives. A street has been named after him in Port Louis, and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906. In 1885 a new constitution was introduced to Mauritius. It created elected positions on the governing council, but the franchise was restricted mainly to the French and Creole classes.\n\nThe labourers brought from India were not always  fairly treated and a German, Adolph von Plevitz, made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants. He mixed with many of the labourers, and in 1871 helped them to write a petition which was sent to Governor Gordon.  Subsequently, a commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants, and in 1872 two lawyers, appointed by the British Crown, were sent from England to make an inquiry. This Royal Commission had a great impact for it recommended a lot of measures that would affect the lives of  Indian labourers during the next fifty years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, in November 1901, Gandhi stopped in Mauritius, on his way to India (from South Africa). He stayed on the island for two weeks, and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics. Back in India, he sent over a young lawyer Manilal Doctor to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians. During the same year, faster links were established with Rodrigues thanks to the wireless. \n\nIn 1903, motorcars were introduced in Mauritius, and in 1910 the first taxis, operated by Joseph Merven, came into service. The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909, and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company (managed by the Atchia Brothers) was authorised to power the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems with electricity.\n\nThe 1910s were a period of great political agitation. The rising middle class (made up of doctors, lawyers, and teachers) began to challenge the political power of the oligarchs—that is, the sugar cane landowners. Dr. Eugène Laurent, mayor of Port Louis, was the leader of this new group; his party, Action Libérale, demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections. Action Libérale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre, led by Henri Leclézio, the most influential of the sugar magnates.\n\nIn 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eugène Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe. Shops and offices were damaged in the capital and one person was killed. In the same year, 1911, the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe and, in the same town, a stone building was erected to house the Royal College.\n\nIn 1912, a wider telephone network came into service and it was used by the government, business firms, and a few private households.\n\nWorld War I broke out in August 1914. Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans, and in Mesopotamia against the Turks. But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century. On the contrary, the 1914–18 war was a period of great prosperity because of a boom in sugar prices. In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being, and it included 70% of all sugar producers.\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of a \"retrocessionism\" movement which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France. The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France was elected in the 1921 elections.\n\nIn 1922, the first aeroplane landed in Mauritius, and in 1923 there were 79 cars on the island. The College of Agriculture was started at Réduit in 1925.\n\nDue to the post-war recession, there was a sharp drop in sugar prices. Many sugar estates closed down, and it marked the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy, but also the political life of the country. Raoul Rivet, the editor of Le Mauricien newspaper, campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country. The principles of Arya Samaj began to infiltrate the Hindu community who clamoured for more social justice.\n\nThe 1930s saw the birth of the Labour Party. It was launched by Dr. Maurice Curé. Emmanuel Anquetil rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class. Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938. More than 30,000 workers sacrificed a day's wage and came from all over the island to attend a giant meeting at the Champ de Mars. \n\nAt the outbreak of World War II in 1939, many Mauritians volunteered to serve under the British flag in Africa and the Near East, fighting against the German and Italian armies. Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the Royal Air Force. Mauritius was never really threatened, but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.\n\nDuring World War II conditions were hard in the country; the prices of commodities doubled but the salaries of workers increased only by 10 or 20 percent. There was civil unrest, and the colonial government did its utmost to crush all trade union activities. However, the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943. Police officers eventually fired on the crowd, and killed three labourers including a boy of ten and a pregnant woman, Anjaly Coopen.  \n\nThe first general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and were won by the Labour Party. This party, led by Guy Rozemont, bettered its position in 1953, and, on the strength of the election results, demanded universal suffrage. Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957, and the ministerial system was introduced. Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959.  The general election was again won by the Labour Party, led this time by Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. \n\nA Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961 and a programme of further constitutional advance was established. The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies. The Colonial Office noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates (by parties) and the voting behaviour (of electors) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations. Around that time, two eminent British academics, Richard Titmuss and James Meade, published a report which dwelt upon the social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane. This led to an intense campaign to halt the population explosion, and the decade registered a sharp decline in population growth.\n\nIndependence (since 1968)\n\nAt the Lancaster Conference of 1965, it became clear that Britain wanted to relieve itself of the colony of Mauritius. In 1959, Harold Macmillan had made his famous Winds of Change Speech where he acknowledged that the best option for Britain was to give complete independence to its colonies. Thus, since the late Fifties, the way was paved for independence. \n\nLater in 1965, after the Lancaster Conference, the Chagos Archipelago was excised from the territory of Mauritius to form the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). A general election took place on 7 August 1967, and the Labour Party and its two allies obtained the majority of seats. Mauritius adopted a new constitution and independence was proclaimed on 12 March 1968. Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam became the first prime minister of an independent Mauritius with Queen Elizabeth II remaining head of state as Queen of Mauritius. In 1969, the opposition party Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) led by Paul Bérenger was founded. Later in 1971, the MMM, backed by unions, called a series of strikes in the port which caused a state of emergency in the country.  The coalition government of the Labour Party and the PMSD (Parti Mauricien Social Democrate) reacted by curtailing civil liberties and curbing the freedom of the press. Assassination attempts were made twice against Paul Bérenger. Neither were successful although the second one led to the death of Azor Adélaïde, a dock worker and activist, on 25 November 1971.  General elections were postponed and public meetings were prohibited. Members of the MMM including Paul Bérenger  were imprisoned on 23 December 1971. The MMM leader was released a year later. \n\nIn May 1975, a student revolt that started at the University of Mauritius swept across the country. The students were unsatisfied with an education system that did not meet their aspirations and gave limited prospects for future employment. On 20 May, thousands of students tried to enter Port-Louis over the Grand River North West bridge and  clashed with the police. An act of Parliament was passed on 16 December 1975 to extend the right to vote to 18-year-olds. This was seen as an attempt to appease the frustration of the younger generation.\n\nThe next general election took place on 20 December 1976. The Labour Party won 28 seats out of 62  but the Prime Minister, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, managed to remain in office, with a two-seat majority, after striking an alliance with the PMSD of Gaetan Duval.\n\nIn 1982 an MMM government led by prime minister Anerood Jugnauth and Paul Bérenger as Minister of Finance was elected. However, ideological and personality differences emerged within the MMM leadership. The power struggle between Bérenger and Jugnauth came to a head in March 1983. Jugnauth travelled to New Delhi to attend a Non-Aligned Movement summit, on Jugnauth's return to Mauritius, Bérenger proposed constitutional changes that would strip power from the prime minister. At Jugnauth's request, prime minister Indira Gandhi of India planned an armed intervention involving the Indian Navy and Indian Army to prevent a coup under the code name Operation Lal Dora.   \n\nThe MMM government split up nine months after the June 1982 election, and the new MSM party, led by Aneerood Jugnauth, was elected to power in 1983. Gaëtan Duval became the vice-prime minister. Throughout the decade, the prime minister, Aneerood Jugnauth, ruled the country with the help of the PMSD and the Labour Party.\n\nThat period saw a growth in the EPZ (Export Processing Zone) sector. Industrialisation began to spread to villages as well, and  attracted young workers from all ethnic communities. As a result, the sugar industry began to lose its hold on the economy. Mammouth stores opened in 1985 and offered credit facilities to low income earners, thus allowing them to afford basic household appliances. There was also a boom in the tourism industry, and new hotels sprang up throughout the island. In 1989 the stock exchange opened its doors and in 1992 the freeport began operation.\n\nRepublic (since 1992)\n\nOn 12 March 1992, twenty-four years after independence, Mauritius was proclaimed a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations. Political power remained with the prime minister.\n\nDespite an improvement in the economy, which coincided with a fall in the price of petrol and a favourable dollar exchange rate, the government did not enjoy full popularity. As early as 1984, there was discontent. Through the Newspapers and Periodicals Amendment Act, the government tried to make every newspaper provide a bank guarantee of half a million rupees. Forty-three journalists protested by participating in a public demonstration in Port Louis, in front of parliament. They were arrested and freed on bail. This caused a public outcry and the government had to review its policy.\n\nThere was also dissatisfaction in the education sector. There were not enough high-quality secondary colleges to answer the growing demand of primary school leavers who had got through their CPE (Certificate of Primary Education).  In 1991, a master plan for education failed to get national support and contributed to the government's downfall.\n\nDr Navin Chandra Ramgoolam was elected as prime minister in the 1995 election. The landslide victory of 60–0 was a repeat of the 1982 score, but this time it was on the side of the Labour–MMM alliance.\n\nIn February 1999, the country experienced a brief period of civil unrest. Riots flared up after the popular singer Kaya, arrested for smoking marijuana at a public concert, was found dead in his prison cell. The president Cassam Uteem and cardinal Jean Margéot toured the country and, after four days of turmoil, calm was restored.   A commission of enquiry was set up to investigate the root causes of the social disturbance. The resulting report delved into the cause of poverty and qualified  many tenacious beliefs as perceptions. \n\nAneerood Jugnauth of the MSM returned to power in 2000 after making an alliance with the MMM, which included prominent figures such as Anil Bachoo, Pravind Jugnauth and Sangeet Fowdar  amongst others. In 2002, Rodrigues became an autonomous entity within the republic and was thus able to elect its own representatives to administer the island. In 2003, the prime ministership was transferred to Paul Bérenger of the MMM, and Aneerood Jugnauth went to Le Réduit to serve as president.\n\nIn the 2005 election, Navin Ramgoolam, leader of the Labour Party, was brought to power after making an alliance with the Parti Mauricien Xavier-Luc Duval (PMXD) and other minor parties.\n\nIn 2008, the French-Mauritian writer Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, and boxer Bruno Julie gave the island its first Olympic medal.\n\nNavin Ramgoolam was again elected in May 2010. This time the Labour Party joined forces with the PMSD and the MSM.\n\nUnder the new government, the country continued with its MID (Maurice Ile Durable) project, started in 2008, to make the economy less dependent on fossil fuels. New biometric identity cards were issued in 2014.\n\nThe political landscape stayed rather confused. The Labour Party did away with the MSM, and then with the PMSD, whose leader had acted as Finance minister. The MMM made an alliance (known as Remake) with the MSM but broke off with the latter to become the ally of Labour Party. Parliament remained closed for the most part of 2014. A second republic was proposed (by the leaders of Labour and MMM) whereby a president, elected by the population, would hold more power and rule the country in joint collaboration with the PM. Nomination day took place on 24 November 2014 and, for the first time, electoral candidates had the option of not proclaiming their ethnic group. Only a few chose to do so. General elections were held on 10 December 2014, and the  Lepep alliance made up of the MSM, PMSD, and Mouvement Liberater (led by an MMM dissident) was elected to power by reaping 47 seats out of 60. The Westminster system was thus maintained and Aneerood Jugnauth became the PM for the sixth time.\n\nShortly after the new government took office, the ex-PM was lengthily interrogated by the Police on charges related to money laundering.  The license of the Bramer Bank was revoked by the Bank of Mauritius due to alleged lack of liquidity, and its wake the BAI (British American Insurance) was suspended from trading and placed in receivership. A new state-owned institution, the National Commercial Bank, was set up to take over from the  Bramer Bank.\n\nA United Nations tribunal ruled that Britain had acted illegally when it created a marine protected area around the Chagos without the consent of Mauritius, thereby depriving this country of its fishing rights. Fresh negotiations began with Jin Fei in view of reviving the project started in 2006. Mauritius will henceforth detain 80% of the shares while the rest would go to the Chinese promoters.\n\nTourism continued to be the main source for foreign exchange, and the number of visitors to the island  reached 1.1 million in 2015. Despite this booming in the Tourist industry, Tourism Minister, Xavier-Luc Duval, has placed a two-year moratorium on the construction of new hotels. This measure is expected to keep the right balance between demand and supply. Furthermore, it will help to uphold the island’s ‘paradise’ image by keeping in check overbuilding along the coast.\n\nTruth and Justice Commission \n\nOperating from 2009 to 2011 the Truth and Justice Commission was established to explore the impact of slavery and indentured servitude in Mauritius. The Commission was tasked to investigate the dispossession of land, and “determine appropriate measures to be extended to descendants of slaves and indentured laborers.”   It was “unique in that it [dealt] with socio-economic class abuses\" and explored the possibility of reparations. The Commission attempted to cover more than 370 years, the longest period of time that a truth commission has ever covered. Published 25 November 2011, the report outlined over 300 recommendations detailing ways to bring those affected by slavery and indentured labour out of poverty. \n\nPolitics\n\nThe politics of Mauritius take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic, in which the President is the head of state and the Prime Minister is the head of government who is assisted by a Council of Ministers. Mauritius has a multi-party system.\n\nExecutive power is exercised by the Government. Legislative power is vested in both the Government and the National Assembly. The absolute power is split between two positions: the President and the Prime Minister.\n\nParliament\n\nThe National Assembly is Mauritius's unicameral parliament, which was called the Legislative Assembly until 1992, when the country became a republic. It consists of 70 members, 62 elected for four-year terms in multi-member constituencies and eight additional members, known as \"best losers\", appointed by the Supreme Court to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are equitably represented. The president is elected for a five-year term by the parliament.\n\nThe island of Mauritius is divided into 20 constituencies that return three members each, while Rodrigues is a single constituency that returns two members. After a general election, the Electoral Supervisory Commission may nominate up to a maximum of eight additional members with a view to correct any imbalance in community representation in Parliament. This system of nominating members is commonly called the best loser system.\n\nThe political party or party alliance that wins the majority of seats in Parliament forms the government, and its leader usually becomes the Prime Minister. It is the Prime Minister who selects the members of the composition of the Cabinet from elected members of the Assembly, except for the Attorney General, who may not be an elected member of the Assembly. The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the President of the Republic as the Leader of the Opposition. The Assembly elects a Speaker, a Deputy Speaker and a Deputy Chairman of Committees as some of its first task.\n\nGovernment\n\nMauritius is a democracy with a government elected every five years. The most recent National Assembly Election was held on 10 December 2014 in all the 20 mainland constituencies, and in the constituency covering the island of Rodrigues. Elections have tended to be a contest between two major coalitions of parties.\n\nThe 2006–2014 Ibrahim Index of African Governance ranked Mauritius first in good governance.  According to the 2011 Democracy Index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit that measures the state of democracy in 167 countries, Mauritius ranks 24th worldwide and is the only African country with \"full democracy\".\n\nRule of law\n\nLaws governing the Mauritian penal system are derived partly from French civil law and British common law.  The crime rate reduced from 4.3 per 1,000 population in 2009 to 3.6 per 1,000 population in 2010.  The Constitution of Mauritius states that for purposes of separation of powers, the judiciary is independent. According to The Heritage Foundation the trials are fair and the legal system is generally non-discriminatory and transparent. The Independent Commission Against Corruption investigates offences and can confiscate the proceeds of corruption and money laundering. Mauritius is one of Africa's least corrupt countries. \n\nForeign relations\n\nMauritius has strong and friendly relations with various African, American, Asian, European and Oceania countries. Considered part of Africa geographically, Mauritius has friendly relations with African states in the region, particularly South Africa, by far its largest continental trading partner. Mauritian investors are gradually entering African markets, notably Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The country's political heritage and dependence on Western markets have led to close ties with the European Union and its member states, particularly France. It also depends on the United Kingdom as a trading partner. Relations with China and India are strong for both historical and commercial reasons.\n\nMauritius is a member of the World Trade Organization, the Commonwealth of Nations, La Francophonie, the African Union, the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), the Indian Ocean Commission, COMESA and formed the Indian Ocean Rim Association.\n\nMilitary\n\nAll military, police, and security functions in Mauritius are carried out by 10,000 active-duty personnel under the command of the Commissioner of Police. The 8,000-member National Police Force is responsible for domestic law enforcement. The 1,500-member Special Mobile Force (SMF) and the 500-member National Coast Guard are the only two paramilitary units in Mauritius. Both units are composed of police officers on lengthy rotations to those services.\n\nGeography\n\nThe total land area of the country is 2,040 km2, which is the 180th largest nation in the world by size. The Republic of Mauritius is constituted of the main island of Mauritius and several outlying islands. The second largest island is Rodrigues with an area of 108 km2 and situated 560 km to the east of Mauritius, the twin island of Agalega with a total land area of 2,600 hectares and situated some 1,000 km to the north of Mauritius. Saint Brandon is an archipelago comprising a number of sand-banks, shoals and islets. It is situated some 430 km to the north-east of Mauritius and is mostly used as a fishing base.  The nation's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) cover about 2.3 million km2 of the Indian Ocean, including approximately 400,000 km2 jointly managed with the Seychelles.   \n\nMauritius island\n\nMauritius is some 2,000 km (1,242 miles) off the southeast coast of Africa, between latitudes 19°58.8' and 20°31.7' south and longitudes 57°18.0' and 57°46.5' east. It is 65 km long and 45 km wide. Its land area is 1,864.8 km2.   The island is surrounded by more than 150 km (93 miles) of white sandy beaches and the lagoons are protected from the open sea by the world's third largest coral reef, which surrounds the island.  Just off the Mauritian coast lie some 49 uninhabited islands and islets, some of them are used as natural reserves for the protection of endangered species.\n\nThe island of Mauritius is relatively young geologically, having been created by volcanic activity some 8 million years ago. Together with Saint Brandon, Réunion, and Rodrigues, the island is part of the Mascarene Islands. These islands have emerged from the abysses as a result of gigantic underwater volcanic eruptions that happened thousands of kilometres to the east of the continental block made up of Africa and Madagascar. They are no longer volcanically active and the hotspot now rests under Réunion Island. Mauritius is encircled by a broken ring of mountain ranges, varying in height from 300–800 m above sea level. The land rises from coastal plains to a central plateau where it reaches a height of 670 m; the highest peak is in the southwest, Piton de la Petite Rivière Noire at 828 m. Streams and rivers speckle the island, a lot of them are formed in the cracks created by lava flows.\n\nTerritorial dispute\n\nChagos Archipelago\n\nMauritius has long sought sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, located 1,287 km to the northeast. Chagos was administratively part of Mauritius from the 18th century when the French first settled the islands. All of the islands forming part of the French colonial territory of Isle de France (as Mauritius was then known) were ceded to the British in 1810 under the Act of Capitulation signed between the two powers.  In 1965, three years before the independence of Mauritius, the United Kingdom split the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius and the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar and Desroches from the Seychelles to form the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). The islands were formally established as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom on 8 November 1965. On 23 June 1976, Aldabra, Farquhar and Desroches were returned to Seychelles as a result of its attaining independence. The BIOT now comprises the Chagos Archipelago only. The UK leased the main island of the archipelago, Diego Garcia to the United States under a 50-year lease (which expires in 2016) to establish a Military base.  Mauritius has repeatedly asserted that the separation of its territories is a violation of United Nations' resolutions banning the dismemberment of colonial territories before independence and claims that the Chagos Archipelago, including Diego Garcia, forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius under both Mauritian law and international law. \nAfter initially denying that the islands were inhabited, British officials forcibly expelled approximately 2,000 Chagossians who had lived on those islands for a century to mainland Mauritius. Since 1971, only the atoll of Diego Garcia is inhabited, home to some 3,000 UK and US military and civilian contracted personnel. Chagossians have since engaged in activism to return to the archipelago, claiming that the forced expulsion and dispossession were illegal.  \n\nMPA Ruling\n\nOn 20 December 2010 Mauritius initiated proceedings against the United Kingdom under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to challenge the legality of the Chagos Marine Protected Area (MPA) which the United Kingdom purported to declare around the Chagos Archipelago in April 2010. The dispute was arbitrated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n\nAfter lengthy written pleadings by the Parties and a hearing from 22 April to 9 May 2014 in Istanbul, Turkey, the Arbitral Tribunal set up under Annex VII to UNCLOS gave its Award on 18 March 2015. The Award is final and without appeal, and is binding on both Parties.\n\nThe Tribunal unanimously held that the ‘marine protected area’ which the UK purported to declare around the Chagos Archipelago in April 2010 violates international law. It is the first time that the United Kingdom’s conduct with regard to the Chagos Archipelago has been considered and condemned by any international court or tribunal. \n\nThe Tribunal held unanimously that, in declaring the ‘MPA’, the United Kingdom violated international law. It ruled that the United Kingdom has breached its obligations under Articles 2(3), 56(2), and 194(4) of UNCLOS. In reaching these conclusions, the Tribunal made a number of important findings. It considered in detail the undertakings given by the United Kingdom to the Mauritian Ministers at the Lancaster House talks in September 1965. The UK had argued that those undertakings were not binding and had no status in international law. The Tribunal firmly rejected that argument, holding that those undertakings became a binding international agreement upon the independence of Mauritius, and have bound the UK ever since. It found that the UK’s commitments towards Mauritius in relation to fishing rights and oil and mineral rights in the Chagos Archipelago are legally binding. Moreover, the Tribunal also found that the United Kingdom’s undertaking to return the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius when no longer needed for defence purposes is legally binding.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to hold that the United Kingdom had not respected Mauritius binding legal rights over the Chagos Archipelago. It considered the events from February 2009 to April 2010, during which time the ‘MPA’ proposal came into being and was then imposed on Mauritius.\n\nThe Tribunal also observed that the failure of the United Kingdom to balance its own rights and interests with those of Mauritius is to be contrasted with the approach adopted by the United Kingdom with respect to the United States. It noted that the record demonstrates a conscious balancing of rights and interests, suggestions of compromise and willingness to offer assurances by the United Kingdom, and an understanding of the United States’ concerns in connection with the proposed ‘MPA’. Those elements were noticeably absent in the United Kingdom’s approach to Mauritius. Accordingly, the Tribunal found that, in declaring the ‘MPA’, the United Kingdom had acted unlawfully and in disregard of Mauritius’ rights.\n\nThe parties differ on the characterization of the dispute. Mauritius states that its case is that the MPA is unlawful under the Convention. The UK argued that the dispute is one about sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. Mauritius requested the Tribunal to adjudge and declare that the United Kingdom is not entitled to declare an “MPA” or other maritime zones because it is not the “coastal State within the meaning of inter alia Articles 2, 55, 56 and 76 of the Convention.” \n\nThe sovereignty of Mauritius was explicitly recognised by two of the arbitrators and denied by none of the other three. Three members of the Tribunal found that they did not have jurisdiction to rule on that question; they expressed no view as to which of the two States has sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. However, and very significantly, two members of the Tribunal, namely Judges Rüdiger Wolfrum and James Kateka, held that the Tribunal did have jurisdiction to decide this question, and concluded that the United Kingdom does not have sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. \nThey found that; \n\n* internal United Kingdom documents suggested there was an ulterior motive behind the ‘MPA’ and noted the disturbing similarities and common pattern between the establishment of the so-called “BIOT” in 1965 and the proclamation of the ‘MPA’ in 2010;\n* the excision of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965 shows a complete disregard for the territorial integrity of Mauritius by the United Kingdom;\n* UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson’s threat to Premier Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam in 1965 that he could return home without independence if he did not consent to the excision of the Chagos Archipelago amounted to duress; Mauritian Ministers were coerced into agreeing to the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago, and that this detachment violated the international law of self-determination,\n* the ‘MPA’ is legally invalid.\n\nThe Tribunal’s Award also determined that the United Kingdom’s undertaking to return the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius gives Mauritius an interest in significant decisions that bear upon the possible future uses of the Archipelago. The result of the Tribunal’s decision is that, it is now open to the Parties to enter into the negotiations that the Tribunal would have expected prior to the proclamation of the MPA, with a view to achieving a mutually satisfactory arrangement for protecting the marine environment, to the extent necessary under a “sovereignty umbrella”.\n\nTromelin\n\nMauritius also claims sovereignty over Tromelin island from France, a small island that lies 430 km to the north-east of Mauritius. \n\nEnvironment and climate\n\nThe environment in Mauritius is typically tropical in the coastal regions with forests in the mountainous areas. Seasonal cyclones are destructive to its flora and fauna, although they recover quickly. Mauritius ranked second in an air quality index released by the World Health Organization in 2011. \n\nSituated near the Tropic of Capricorn, Mauritius has a tropical climate. There are 2 seasons: a warm humid summer from November to April, with a mean temperature of 24.7 °C and a relatively cool dry winter from June to September with a mean temperature of 20.4 °C. The temperature difference between the seasons is only 4.3 °C. The warmest months are January and February with average day maximum temperature reaching 29.2 °C and the coolest months are July and August when average night minimum temperatures drops down to 16.4 °C. Annual rainfall ranges from 900 mm on the coast to 1,500 mm on the central plateau. Although there is no marked rainy season, most of the rainfall occurs in summer months. Sea temperature in the lagoon varies from 22–27 °C. The central plateau is much cooler than the surrounding coastal areas and can experience as much as double the rainfall. The prevailing trade winds keep the east side of the island cooler and also tend to bring more rain there. There can also be a marked difference in temperature and rainfall from one side of the island to the other. Occasional tropical cyclones generally occurs between January to March and tend to disrupt the weather for only about three days, bringing a lot of rain. \n\nBiodiversity\n\nThe country is home to some of the world's rarest plants and animals, but human habitation and the introduction of non-native species have threatened its indigenous flora and fauna. Due to its volcanic origin, age, isolation, and its unique terrain, Mauritius is home to a diversity of flora and fauna not usually found in such a small area. Before its discovery by the Portuguese in 1507, there were no terrestrial mammals on the island. This allowed the evolution of a number of flightless birds and large reptile species. The arrival of man saw the introduction of invasive alien species and the rapid destruction of habitat and the loss of much of the endemic flora and fauna. Less than 2% of the native forest that once stretched from the mountain tops of the central plateau to the shore now remains, concentrated in the Black River Gorges National Park in the southwest, the Bamboo Mountain Range in the southeast, and the Moka-Port Louis Ranges in the northwest. There are also some isolated mountains, Corps de Garde, Le Morne Brabant, and several offshore islands with remnants of coastal and mainland diversity. Over 100 species of plants and animals have become extinct and many more are threatened. Conservation activities began in the 1980s with the implementation of programmes for the reproduction of threatened bird and plant species as well as habitat restoration in the national parks and nature reserves. \n\nWhen it was discovered, the island of Mauritius was the home of a previously unknown species of bird, the dodo. It is claimed that Dodos were descendants of a type of pigeon which settled in Mauritius over four million years ago, but this is disputed. It is understood that with no predators to attack them, they lost their need and ability to fly. Arabs became the first humans to set foot on Mauritius, followed by Portuguese around 1505. The island quickly became a stopover for ships engaged in the spice trade. Weighing up to 50 pounds, the dodo was a welcome source of fresh meat for the sailors. Large numbers of dodos were killed for food. Later, when the Dutch used the island as a penal colony, new species were introduced to the island. Rats, pigs, and monkeys ate dodo eggs in the ground nests. The combination of human exploitation and introduced species significantly reduced the dodo population. Within 100 years of the arrival of humans on Mauritius, the once abundant dodo became a rare bird. The last one was killed in 1681.  The dodo is prominently featured as a (heraldic) supporter of the national coat of arms of Mauritius.\n\nDistricts\n\nMauritius is divided into nine districts which consist of different cities, towns and villages.\n\nDemographics\n\nThe estimated resident population of the Republic of Mauritius was 1,261,208 as of 1 July 2014. The female population was 637,032 compared to a male population of 624,176. The population on the island of Mauritius is 1,219,265, and that of Rodrigues island is 41,669; Agalega and Saint Brandon had an estimated total population of 274.  Mauritius has the highest population density in Africa.\n\nEthnic groups\n\nOfficial statistics on ethnicity are not available, as such questions were removed from the population census in 1972.  Mauritius is a multiethnic society, drawn from Indian, African, European (mostly French) and Chinese origin.\n\nReligion\n\nAccording to the 2011 census conducted by Statistics Mauritius, Hinduism is the major religion at 48.5%, followed by Christianity (32.7%), Islam (17.3%) and Buddhism (0.4%). Those of other religions accounted for 0.2% of the population, while non-religious individuals were 0.7%. Finally, 0.1% refused to fill in any data.  Mauritius is the only country in Africa to have a Hindu plurality.\n\nAn officially secular state, Mauritius is a religiously diverse nation, with freedom of religion being enshrined as a constitutional right.  The vibrant and colorful culture of the Mauritian people is reflected in the various religious festivities that are celebrated throughout the year, some of which are recognized as public holidays.\n\nLanguage\n\nAs both an English-speaking and French-speaking nation, Mauritius is a member of both the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie. The Mauritian constitution makes no mention of an official language. In Parliament, the official language is English; however, any member of the National Assembly can also address the chair in French. English and French are generally accepted as the official languages of Mauritius and as the languages of government administration, courts, and business. The constitution of Mauritius is written in English, while some laws, such as the Civil code, are in French.\n\nThe Mauritian population is multilingual; most Mauritians are equally fluent in English and French, while Mauritian Creole is the mother tongue of most Mauritians, people tend to switch languages according to the situation; French and English are favoured in educational and professional settings while Asian languages are used mainly in music, religious and cultural activities. The media and literature are primarily in French.\n\nThe Creole language, derived mainly from French (a French-based Creole) with influences from the other dialects, is spoken by the majority of the population and is the country's native language.  The Creole languages which are spoken in different islands of the country are more or less similar: Mauritian Creole, Rodriguan Creole, Agalega Creole and Chagossian Creole are spoken by people from the islands of Mauritius, Rodrigues, Agalega and Chagos. Bhojpuri which was widely spoken as mother tongue, has been decreasing over the years. According to the 2011 census, there was a decrease in the use of Bhojpuri at home, it was spoken by 5% of the population compared to 12% in 2000. \n\nSome ancestral languages that are also spoken in Mauritius include Arabic,  Bhojpuri,  Chinese,  Hindi,  Marathi,  Sanskrit,  Tamil,  Telugu  and Urdu.  School students must learn English and French; they also have the option to study Asian languages and Creole. The medium of instruction varies from school to school but is usually French or English.\n\nHealth\n\nMauritius had a life expectancy of 75.17 in 2014. 39% of Mauritian men smoked in 2014.  12.9% of men and 23% of women were obese in 2008.\n\nHeroin use has a high prevalence rate of 0.91% (2011 UN figure);  see also Drugs in Mauritius.\n\nEducation\n\nThe government of Mauritius provides free education to its citizens from pre-primary to tertiary level. In 2013 government expenditure on education was estimated at about Rs 13,584 million, representing 13% of total expenditure. \n\nThe adult literacy rate was estimated at 89.8% in 2011. Male literacy was 92.3% and female literacy 87.3%. \n\nThe education system in Mauritius consists of pre-primary, primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. The education structure consists of three years of pre-primary school, six years of primary schooling leading to the Certificate of Primary Education, followed by five years of secondary education leading to the School Certificate and a further two years of higher secondary ending with the Higher School Certificate.\n\nThe O-Level and A-Level examinations are carried out by the University of Cambridge through University of Cambridge International Examinations. The Tertiary Education sector includes colleges, universities and other technical institutions in Mauritius. The country's two main public universities are the University of Mauritius and the University of Technology. The Tertiary Education Commission's Strategic Plan envisages Mauritius as a regional knowledge hub and a centre for higher learning and excellence. It promotes open and distance learning to increase access to post-secondary education and lifelong learning locally and regionally. \n\nEconomy\n\nSince independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed from a low-income, agriculture-based economy to a middle-income diversified economy. The economy is based on tourism, textiles, sugar, and financial services. In recent years, information and communication technology, seafood, hospitality and property development, healthcare, renewable energy, and education and training have emerged as important sectors, attracting substantial investment from both local and foreign investors. \n\nMauritius has no exploitable natural resources and therefore depends on imported petroleum products to meet most of its energy requirements. Local and renewable energy sources are biomass, hydro, solar and wind energy.  Mauritius has one of the largest Exclusive Economic Zones in the world, and in 2012 the government announced its intention to develop the marine economy. \n\nMauritius is ranked high in terms of economic competitiveness, a friendly investment climate, good governance and a free economy.   The Gross Domestic Product (PPP) was estimated at $22.025 billion in 2014, and  GDP (PPP) per capita was over $16,820, one of the highest in Africa.\n\nMauritius has an upper middle income economy, according to the World Bank in 2011.  For the fifth consecutive year, the World Bank's 2013 Ease of Doing Business report ranks Mauritius first among African economies and 19th worldwide out of 183 economies in terms of ease of doing business.\n\nMauritius has built its success on a free market economy, according to the 2013 Index of Economic Freedom Mauritius is ranked as having the 8th most free economy in the world, and the highest score in investment freedom.  The report's ranking of 183 countries is based on measures of economic openness, regulatory efficiency, rule of law, and competitiveness.\n\nTourism\n\nMauritius is one of the world's top luxury tourism destinations.  It possesses a wide range of natural and human-made attractions, enjoys a tropical climate with clear warm sea waters, attractive beaches, tropical fauna and flora complemented by a multi-ethnic and cultural population. These tourism assets are its main strength, especially since they are backed up by well-designed and run hotels, and reliable and operational services and infrastructures. \n\nMauritius received the World Leading Island Destination award for the third time and World's Best Beach at the World Travel Awards in January 2012. \n\nTransportation\n\nSince 2005 public bus transport in Mauritius is free of charge for students, people with disabilities and senior citizens.  There are currently no railways in Mauritius, former privately owned industrial railways having been abandoned. To cope with increasing road traffic congestion, a Light Rail Transit system has been proposed between Curepipe and Port Louis.\n\nThe harbour of Port Louis handles international trade as well as a cruise terminal. The sole international airport for civil aviation is Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport, which also serves as the home operating base for the national airline Air Mauritius; the airport authority inaugurated a new passenger terminal in September 2013.  Another airport is the Sir Gaëtan Duval Airport in Rodrigues.\n\nCulture\n\nMusic\n\nThe major musical genre of Mauritius is Sega music, other musical genres are its fusion genre, Seggae and Bhojpuri songs.\n\nCuisine\n\nSeafood is an important component in the cuisine of Mauritius.\n\nHolidays and festivals\n\nThe public holidays of Mauritius involve the blending of several cultures from Mauritius's history. There are Hindu festivals, Chinese festivals, Muslim festivals, as well as Christian festivals.\n\nThere are 15 annual public holidays in Mauritius. Seven of these are fixed holidays: 1 and 2 January; 1 February; 12 March; 1 May; 2 November; and 25 December. The remaining public holidays are religious festivals with dates that vary from year to year. However these are public holidays, many other festivals such as Holi, Raksha Bandhan, Père Laval Pilgrimage also exist in Mauritius.\n\nSports\n\nThe most popular sport in Mauritius is football  and the national team is the Club M, other popular sports in Mauritius include cycling, table tennis, badminton, volleyball, basketball, handball, boxing, judo, karate, taekwondo, weightlifting, bodybuilding and athletics. Water sports includes swimming, sailing, scuba diving, and water skiing.\n\nHorseracing, which dates back to 1812, when the Champ de Mars Racecourse was inaugurated, remain very popular. The country hosted the second (1985) and fifth editions (2003) of the Indian Ocean Island Games. Mauritius won its first Olympic medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing when boxer Bruno Julie won the bronze medal.\n\nIn golf, the former Mauritius Open and the current AfrAsia Bank Mauritius Open have been part of the European Tour."

Weird Island Animals Described in Long-Lost Report\nBy Joseph Castro, Live Science Contributor |\nMay 7, 2015 06:54am ET\nMORE\nMauritius Island's extinct raven parrot, which was \"very bad tempered,\" according to an early Dutch settler.\nCredit: Julian Hume, London Natural History Museum\nThe dodo bird was not the only wacky animal inhabitant of the island of Mauritius: Bad-tempered parrots, wart-faced pigeons and several other now-extinct but noteworthy indigenous animals called this land home, new research suggests.\nHistorians had previously identified the animals that lived on the island before Dutch settlers arrived in the 17th century, but the details about these creatures had remained largely unknown.\n\"There are lots of reports of the original wildlife of Mauritius ,\" said Julian Hume, an avian paleontologist and artist with London's Natural History Museum. \"But almost all of them only say things like, 'This bird was easy to catch,' and 'It was good to eat.'\"\nNow, Hume's colleague Ria Winters has discovered a report on these animals written by a Dutch settler. A translation of the report, which Winters found in the Netherlands' National Archives in The Hague amid thousands of other yet-to-be translated documents, provides far more information about the behavior, ecology and physical appearance of the animals that once roamed the island, Hume told Live Science. [ See Images of the Wacky Animals from Maritius Island ]\nOrigin of the report\nMauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues make up the volcanic, isolated Mascarene Islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean. Though Arab traders and Portuguese sailors knew of the islands since the 14th and 16th centuries, respectively, neither group settled there, Hume said.\nA forest scene of what Mauritius may have been like prior to the arrival of the Dutch settlers, when the dodo still lived.\nCredit: Julian Hume, London Natural History Museum\nThe Dutch claimed Mauritius for the Netherlands in 1598, and the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC) periodically used the island as a replenishment station for trading vessels traveling to the East Indies before establishing a permanent settlement in 1638. Twenty years later, they abandoned the island when they found a shorter path to the East Indies — and because of the rat populations that grew out of control on Mauritius since the Dutch arrived, according to Hume — only to return in 1664.\nPartly due to a lack of updates from the Dutch commander of the island, the VOC, in 1666, sent a soldier named Johannes Pretorius, and two other people, to Mauritius to check on the status of the settlement. When they arrived, they found the commander alive and well, and Pretorius took on the role of ziekentrooster, or comforter of the sick. (He would have otherwise become second in command). \"The ziekentrooster had to be a person of authority and their job was limited to explanations of Christian doctrine and giving prayers. Only a pastor could give pardons and blessings,\" Hume said.\nThree years later, in 1669, Pretorius authored the newly discovered report (likely for the VOC) while onboard a ship on its way to a larger VOC replacement station in Cape Peninsula, South Africa.\nIt's unclear why Pretorius wrote the report, Hume said. \"His writing style suggests he was given the task of reporting on the island's suitability for long-term settlement,\" which includes what kinds of crops could be grown on the island and what wildlife exists to eat, he said.\nAn enlightening report\nAlthough Pretorius' letter touches on the various ungulates — including cattle, goats, pigs and deer — that the Dutch brought to Mauritius, the most enlightening portions of the text describe the island's indigenous life .\nFor instance, based on other reports, Hume had previously argued that the island's raven parrot, which became extinct in 1675, had a blackish-brown body with a blue head and possibly a red beak. But based on Pretorius' descriptions and a re-examination of other accounts, Hume now thinks the bird was brightly colored and predominantly red. [ 6 Strange Species Discovered in Museums ]\nPretorius' account also suggests the raven parrot was behaviorally flightless (it couldn't fly well, despite having the biology to do so) and that this flaw likely led to the creature's demise. The bird was tough and aggressive — or \"very bad tempered,\" as Pretorius described it — and able to fend off introduced predators such as black rats and crab-eating macaques, but only for so long, Hume said.\nThe parrot's obstinate attitude also prevented it from being transported elsewhere. \"When captive, it refuses to eat,\" Pretorius wrote. \"It would prefer to die rather than to live in captivity.\"\nAnother interesting animal that was indigenous to the island was the Mauritius blue pigeon (Alectroenas nitidissima), which went extinct in 1837, Hume said. All other Alectroenas species are known to have warty faces, but contemporary artists depicted A. nitidissima as having smooth faces. \"It seemed bizarre, but we thought that must have been the case,\" Hume said. But according to Pretorius, A. nitidissima was warty, just like its cousins.\nIn his report, Pretorius also describes the behavior and low intelligence of the extinct (circa 1700) flightless red rail, a bird that's sometimes confused with the dodo in old documents; the first-ever account of what Mauritius' giant tortoises ate (dead leaves and apples); how the introduced animals affected the island; how little the early Dutch settlers knew of the interior of Mauritius, which was inaccessible at the time because of densely packed vegetation; and the difficulties of growing nonpotato crops on the island, mostly due to voracious rats.\n\"The key thing about it was that it showed how difficult it was during those times just to survive on Mauritius,\" Hume said.\nHume and Winters recently published their analysis of Pretorius' report in the journal Historical Biology .",

                "Mauritius DODO\nMauritius Dodo\nMauritius DODO\n \nThe dodo  was a flightless bird endemic to the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. Related to pigeons and doves, it stood about a meter (3.3 feet) tall, weighing about 20 kilograms (44 lb), living on fruit, and nesting on the ground.\n \nThe dodo has been extinct since the mid-to-late 17th century. It is commonly used as the archetype of an extinct species because its extinction occurred during recorded human history and was directly attributable to human activity.\n \nThe phrase \"dead as a dodo\" means undoubtedly and unquestionably dead, whilst the phrase \"to go the way of the dodo\" means to become extinct or obsolete, to fall out of common usage or practice, or to become a thing of the past\n \nThe first known descriptions of the bird were made by early Dutch travellers. It was known by the name \"walghvogel\" (\"wallow bird\" or \"loathsome bird\") in reference to its taste, a name that was used for the first time in the journal of vice-admiral Wybrand van Warwijck, who visited the island in 1598 and named it Mauritius. It was also referred to as \"dronte\" by the Dutch, a name which is still used in some languages. Although many later writings say that the meat tasted bad, the early journals only say that the meat was tough but good, though not as good as the abundantly available pigeons.\n \nIn 1606 Cornelis Matelief de Jonge wrote an important description of the dodo, some other birds, plants and animals on the island. He described the dodo thus:\nBlue parrots are very numerous there, as well as other birds ; among which are a kind, conspicuous for their size, larger than our swans, with huge heads only half covered with skin as if clothed with a hood. These birds lack wings, in the place of which 3 or 4 blackish feathers protrude. The tail consists of a few soft incurved feathers, which are ash coloured. These we used to call ' Walghvogel,' for the reason that the longer and oftener they were cooked, the less soft and more insipid eating they became. Nevertheless their belly and breast were of a pleasant flavour and easily masticated.\n \nFew took particular notice of the bird immediately after its extinction. By the early 19th century it seemed altogether too strange a creature, and was believed by many to be a myth. In 1848, H. E. Strickland and A. G. Melville published a book titled The Dodo and Its Kindred; or the History, Affinities, and Osteology of the Dodo, Solitaire, and Other Extinct Birds of the Islands Mauritius, Rodriguez, and Bourbon in which they attempted to separate Dodo myth from reality. With the discovery of the first batch of dodo bones in the Mauritian swamp, the Mare aux Songes, and the reports written about them by George Clarke, government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, from 1865 on, interest in the bird was rekindled.\n \nThe etymology of the word dodo is unclear. Some ascribe it to the Dutch word dodoor for \"sluggard\", but it more likely is related to dodaars (\"knot-arse\"), referring to the knot of feathers on the hind end. The first recording of the word dodaerse is in captain Willem van Westsanen's journal in 1602. Thomas Herbert used the word dodo in 1627, but it is unclear whether he was the first; the Portuguese had visited the island in 1507, but, as far as is known, did not mention the bird. Nevertheless, according to the Encarta Dictionary and Chambers Dictionary of Etymology, \"dodo\" derives from Portuguese doudo (currently doido) meaning \"fool\" or \"crazy\". However, the present Portuguese name for the bird, dodô, is taken from the internationally used word dodo.\nDavid Quammen considered the idea that dodo was an onomatopoeic approximation of the bird's own call, a two-note pigeony sound like \"doo-doo\".",
                "Dodo Bird: an Extinct Species\nDodo Bird: an Extinct Species\nTHE DODO BIRD\nEXTINCT\nThe dodo bird inhabited the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, where it lived undisturbed for so long that it lost its need and ability to fly. It lived and nested on the ground and ate fruits that had fallen from trees. There were no mammals on the island and a high diversity of bird species lived in the dense forests.\nIn 1505, the Portuguese became the first humans to set foot on Mauritius. The island quickly became a stopover for ships engaged in the spice trade. Weighing up to 50 pounds, the dodo bird was a welcome source of fresh meat for the sailors. Large numbers of dodo birds were killed for food.\nLater, when the Dutch used the island as a penal colony, pigs and monkeys were brought to the island along with the convicts. Many of the ships that came to Mauritius also had uninvited rats aboard, some of which escaped onto the island.\nBefore humans and other mammals arrived the dodo bird had little to fear from predators. The rats, pigs and monkeys made short work of vulnerable dodo bird eggs in the ground nests.\nThe combination of human exploitation and introduced species significantly reduced dodo bird populations. Within 100 years of the arrival of humans on Mauritius, the once abundant dodo bird was a rare bird.\nThe last dodo bird was killed in 1681.\nAlthough the tale of the dodo bird’s demise is well documented, no complete specimens of the bird were preserved; there are only fragments and sketches. The dodo bird is just one of the bird species driven to extinction on Mauritius. Many others were lost in the 19th century when the dense Mauritian forests were converted into tea and sugar plantations.\nOf the 45 bird species originally found on Mauritius, only 21 have managed to survive.\nAlthough the dodo bird became extinct in 1681, its story is not over. We are just beginning to understand the effects of its extinction on the ecosystem.\nRecently a scientist noticed that a certain species of tree was becoming quite rare on Mauritius. In fact, he noticed that all 13 of the remaining trees of this species were about 300 years old. No new trees had germinated since the late 1600s.\nSince the average life span of this tree was about 300 years, the last members of the species were extremely old. They would soon die, and the species would be extinct. Was it just a coincidence that the tree had stopped reproducing 300 years ago and that the dodo bird had become extinct 300 years ago? No.\nIt turns out that the dodo bird ate the fruit of this tree, and it was only by passing through the dodo’s digestive system that the seeds became active and could grow. Now, more than 300 years after one species became extinct, another was to follow as a direct consequence. Will more follow?\nLuckily, some creative people discovered that domestic turkey gullets sufficiently mimic the action of the dodo bird’s digestive system. They have used turkeys to begin a new generation of the tree, which is now called the dodo tree. If these seedlings survive to produce their own seeds, the species will be saved.\nQuestions for Thought:\nMauritius is a medium-sized island that is extremely far away from any mainland. What does Island biogeography suggest about such places?\nBirds and bats are frequently responsible for the natural pollination and seed dispersal of trees. What will their extinctions and endangerment mean for the forests where they live?",
                "Dead as a dodo - the extinct bird of Mauritius - The Official Globe Trekker Website\nDead as a dodo – the extinct bird of Mauritius\nNature Facts\nWhere: Mauritius, Indian Ocean\nWhen: First sighted in late 1600s, destroyed by man by 1861\nNature facts: A flightless bird destroyed by its fearlessness and alien species brought over by European settlers\nWhere to see: A skeleton and life-size reconstruction in Natural History Museum, Port Louis, Mauritius\nMauritius was once home to an amazing array of indigenous birds and land creatures, until the arrival of the first European explorers in the seventeenth century. They ate half the indigenous animal population, including the dodo – that flightless bird of near-mythical status that organised the Caucus Race in Lewis Carroll’s children’s book, Alice in Wonderland.\nHistory of the Demise of the Dodo\nThe dodo, named from the Dutch for ’round arse’, was first witnessed by Dutch sailors in the late 1600s and its last sighting was in 1861. The dodo is a symbol of man’s destruction but also a sign of stupidity, thus the expression, “dead as a dodo.” This three-foot tall flightless bird lived on fruit and nested on the ground, was entirely fearless of humans, and took advantage of the island’s lack of predators.\nHowever, it was not humans as prey that destroyed the dodo – in fact the Portuguese settler called it walgvogel (‘ghastly bird’) because however it was cooked, its meat was as tough as boots and foul (rather than fowl) tasting. It was other wildlife on Mauritius that led to its downfall – principally the alien species that the Europeans brought with them – pigs, rats, and monkeys.\nSurvival of the Dodo Tree\nDestroying one species has a knock-on effect for other flora and fauna in the same region. In 1973, scientists discovered that a species of tree on Mauritius, commonly known as the dodo tree, was dying out with only thirteen specimens remaining, all of which were 300 years old, dating to the time the last dodo was killed. It was thought that the dodos ate the seeds of the tree and the seeds only became active after passing through the bird. Scientists found a solution by using turkeys to re-fertilize the dodo tree.\nThe Recreation of the Dodo\nIt is curious that a bird without wings can exist on an island. Experts belief the dodo could fly but once it got to Mauritius it chose not to; it had a strange reverse evolution of trying to achieve flightlessness. Curiouser and curiouser are claims springing from around 1990 that the dodo still exists – including one from Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling who fictionally claimed the dodo is alive and well, but it is called the Diricawl by wizards. This magical bird can vanish and reappear elsewhere, leading muggles (non-magical humans) to believe it is extinct.\nBut the truth is stranger than fiction. Scientists belief the technology exists to re-create a dodo from DNA, leading to nightmarish Jurassic Park visions of giant dodo taking over the island. As most of the island’s population is Hindu, re-incarnation sits fairly comfortably with their beliefs, but Mauritians are determined that if the dodo ever lives again it should do so in Mauritius.\nTourism and the Dodo\nToday, Mauritians are more respectful of this strange, inflated pigeon of a bird and respect its legacy. A rampant dodo appears on the Mauritian coat of arms and Mauritians know the dodo mean the tourist dollar – in the international airport’s duty-free shop you’ll find wooden dodos, plaster dodos, fluffy toy dodos, and gem-studded gold dodos.\nNo complete bird exists, although several skeletons and reconstructions are in museums around the world, and a dodo egg is on display at the East London Museum in South Africa. Victorian scientists were fascinated by the story of the bird and went to great lengths to investigate its history. They made a reconstruction of a skeleton from a pile of old bones, which can be viewed in the Natural History Museum, a crumbling colonial building in Jardin de la Compagnie, Port Louis. Here you will also find an impressive life-size mock-up of the entire bird, which is a similar size to a turkey and sits inside a dusty cabinet.\nMore Information\nBooks\nDodo, The Bird Behind the Legend by Alan Grihault (who appeared in the TV show Globe Trekker: Indian Ocean Islands)\nOrder from IPC Ltd, Menagerie Road, Cassis, Mauritius.

                "BOOKS OF THE TIMES -  Bird as Unlikely Hero - NYTimes.com\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES; Bird as Unlikely Hero\nBy MICHIKO KAKUTANI\nPublished: December 13, 1986\nDODO. By Tony Weeks-Pearson. 158 pages. Viking. $14.95.\nDodo - the word, according to Webster's, means ''one hopelessly behind the times,'' a ''stupid person''; or less metaphorically, ''an extinct heavy flightless bird related to the pigeons but larger than a turkey formerly present on the island of Mauritius.'' An unlikely creature, doomed to extinction by its rather enchanting eccentricities; and now, the unlikely hero of an equally eccentric first novel.\nIn the dodo bird, the British writer Tony Weeks-Pearson finds a sort of all-purpose symbol. As portrayed by him, the bird becomes, at once, a scientific curiosity, hunted by eager students of biology; a fairy-tale godparent, charged with watching over wayward human beings, and a Christ-figure, cruelly sacrificed on the altar of human greed - and not-so-miraculously resurrected by modern science. The bird's home similarly takes on allegorical qualities - it is never referred to as Mauritius but simply as ''the Island,'' and in the author's account, it becomes a magical place, representative of all the Edens despoiled by man, and more specifically, of all the distant lands despoiled by colonialism and its sins.\nMr. Weeks-Pearson's prose has an odd, herky-jerky rhythm to it - his sentences often sound like attempts at verse, written by someone in the throes of learning English - and combined with his heavy reliance on symbolic action, it lends his story a strange folk-art quality. Many of the scenes (children dancing like birds by the shore of a lake; extravagantly costumed people worshiping dodo effigies) have a decidedly dreamlike quality to them; and even the more naturalistic ones reverberate with mythic overtones.\nLike many fables, ''Dodo'' ends with the promise of rebirth and redemption, but it begins, quite brutally, with a mass killing of thousands of innocent dodo birds by a rapacious explorer named Dodson (the ''son of Dodo,'' perhaps?) and his men. ''None of them tried to escape, though there were only a dozen men,'' writes Mr. Weeks-Pearson, ''Out in the open now, Dodson laughed. Damned, stupid beasts. Beasts, not birds. Too stupid even to fly. Yes, hundreds between him and the white edge of sea. White crowds.''\nYears pass - a few birds survive, but they are to see their island paradise undergo more drastic and more permanent changes. French landowners have taken over, and while their black slaves are eventually freed, cheap Indian labor is soon imported; and racial and class tensions continue to build.\nWhile a pair of dodos still live deep in the island's forest, the species has already become a kind of legend -relegated to obscure history books, until a schoolteacher by the name of Fitch arrives on the island and sets off on a quest for the missing birds. To him, the dodo's existence represents one of the great riddles of science; its apparent extinction, one of the great quandaries of religion -how could God let one of His creatures die, he wonders. How could He allow such an event to happen?\nFitch organizes a search: a swamp known as the Sea of Dreams is drained, and assorted dodo bones are found. And even as the last living dodo performs a dance in the forest -a pregnant woman who has sought refuge in the woods kills him in a sacrificial ritual - a skeleton of the bird is assembled. As a consequence, Fitch is proclaimed a hero, and the Island, itself, is ushered into a brave, new era: the bird is incorporated in a new national crest; a dodo stamp is issued, and a museum of arts and sciences is planned.\nWhat's more, the bird becomes a kind of folk hero, and as Mr. Weeks-Pearson amusingly recounts, all manner of social consequences result. Birds of all sorts benefit - in the absence of dodos, all species become popular: ''Hens and ducks found themselves fussed over and became brazen; wild parrots were spoken to, with courtesy; people went into woods and thickets to observe the birds - chided one another if noise disturbed them.'' Bird cages are burned; cats are threatened; ladies wearing feathered hats are insulted. Dances like the ''moorhen,'' the ''pigeon,'' and the ''parakeet'' - which employ gestures based on the courtship movements of the respective birds - grow popular, and feathered styles of dress enjoy a vogue.\nEven the local language experiences some changes: ''People became uncomfortable, if not superstitious, with loose expressions derived from birds or using their names for discourtesy. Parrot was no longer applied to people, nor cuckoo nor blackbird. Though 'pigeon' secretly gained ground as a term of special endearment.''\nAs conditions on the Island suddenly begin to deteriorate - a cholera epidemic of biblical-plague proportions hits the population, followed by a series of cyclones - the dodo fads are replaced by more overtly religious preoccupations. Bird cults spring up: some feature ''dodo bones as their sacred centre''; others center on doctor-priests dressed as the extinct creatures.\nEntertaining as Mr. Weeks-Pearson's descriptions of dodo-exploitation and dodo-veneration may be, their satiric quality meshes poorly with the stark, folkloric quality of the preceding chapters, and the reader is left with lots of dangling questions. Are we to take the dodo-bird as a symbol of a phony godhead or an unwitting victim of history? Is the dodo's sad story somehow representative of the island's own destiny, or is it meant as a cautionary tale of innocence betrayed? In the end, the author never persuades us to care about such issues; instead, his self-conscious narrative teases us with rumblings of significance only to dwindle into empty syllables of portentous noise.",
                "The Dodo Bird | History, Story and Resources for Dodobirds\nThe Story of the Dodo Bird\nA Reference Site for The Dodo Bird and it's History\nThe Dodo bird or Raphus Cucullatus was a flightless bird native to the island of Mauritius, near the island of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The closest relatives to the dodo bird are pigeons and doves, even though dodo birds were much larger in size. On average, dodo birds stood 3 feet tall and weighted about 40 lb. Unfortunately, due to aggressive human population, dodo birds became extinct in late 17th century.\nThe Dodo Bird Location\nDodo Birds, while now extinct, were found only on the small island of Mauritius, some 500 miles east of Madagascar, and 1200 miles east of Africa.\nThe complete isolation of this island let the Dodo Birds grow and evolve without natural predators, unfortunately to a fault that led to their extinction."

                "Patti Davis (born October 21, 1952) is an American actress and author. She is the daughter of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Reagan's second wife, First Lady Nancy Reagan.\n\nEarly life\n\nPatricia Ann Reagan was born to Ronald and Nancy Reagan on October 21, 1952, in Los Angeles, California. She is the older sister of Ron Reagan, the half-sister of Michael Reagan and the late Maureen Reagan.  She went to grade school at The John Thomas Dye School in Bel Air, and graduated from the Orme School of Arizona in 1970.  She attended Northwestern University from 1970–71, where she studied Creative Writing and Drama. She then went to the University of Southern California for two years.  She changed her last name to her mother's maiden name, Davis, in an effort to have an independent career.   She was active in the anti-nuclear movement before her father was elected president, and continued her activism through his term, stirring controversy and creating strife in the family.\n\nActing, modeling and writing careers\n\nIn the early 1980s, Davis acted in a few television shows before getting her first publishing deal.  In 1986, she published her first novel, Home Front.  She used elements of her own life to create a fictional story, and because of that the book became controversial and she was widely criticized.  Following her second novel Deadfall, she wrote an autobiography called The Way I See It, in which she revealed many family dramas and secrets.  She has since spoken publicly about her regrets over writing that book. \n\nDavis posed for Playboy magazine with a \"Full Frontal\" view, in the July 1994 issue. This issue of the magazine also displays Davis on the cover. This particular issue is considered to be one of the magazine's most controversial covers. Davis has posed for other magazines such as More in 2011.\n\nWhen her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's she began writing The Long Goodbye.  It was published in 2004.  During that time, she began writing for magazines and newspapers, including The New York Times, Newsweek and Time.  Her original screenplay, Spring Thaw, became the 2007 Hallmark Channel movie Sacrifices of the Heart starring Melissa Gilbert and Ken Howard. \n\nPersonal life\n\nIn the 1970s, Davis lived with Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon. Together they cowrote the song \"I Wish You Peace\" which appeared on the Eagles album One of These Nights.   In the 1980s, she dated Timothy Hutton and later had a two-year relationship with Peter Strauss.  In 1984, she married Paul Grilley, a yoga instructor. They divorced in 1990.\n\nIn 2011, she launched \"Beyond Alzheimer's\" at UCLA, which she still runs.  \n\nBibliography\n\n*Home Front.  Crown, 1986.  ISBN 0-517-55952-8.  (quasi-novel)\n*Deadfall.

                "Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher,  ( Roberts; 13 October 1925 – 8 April 2013) was a British stateswoman and politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and the Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have held the office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.\n\nOriginally a research chemist before becoming a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election.\n\nOn moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her re-election in 1983.\n\nThatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987. During this period her support for a Community Charge (referred to as the \"poll tax\") was widely unpopular, and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the county of Lincolnshire, which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. After a series of small strokes in 2002, she was advised to withdraw from public speaking. Despite this, she managed to prerecord a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death, which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004.  In 2013, she died of another stroke in London at the age of 87.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nThatcher was born Margaret Hilda Roberts on 13 October 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire. Her father was Alfred Roberts, originally from Northamptonshire, and her mother was Beatrice Ethel (née Stephenson) from Lincolnshire. She spent her childhood in Grantham, where her father owned two grocery shops. She and her older sister Muriel (1921–2004) were raised in the flat above the larger of the two, on North Parade. Her father was active in local politics and the Methodist church, serving as an alderman and a local preacher, and brought up his daughter as a strict Wesleyan Methodist  attending the Finkin Street Methodist Church. He came from a Liberal family but stood – as was then customary in local government – as an Independent. He was Mayor of Grantham in 1945–46 and lost his position as alderman in 1952 after the Labour Party won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950.\n\nMargaret Roberts attended Huntingtower Road Primary School and won a scholarship to Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School. Her school reports showed hard work and continual improvement; her extracurricular activities included the piano, field hockey, poetry recitals, swimming and walking. She was head girl in 1942–43.  In her upper sixth year she applied for a scholarship to study chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, but she was initially rejected and was offered a place only after another candidate withdrew. Roberts arrived at Oxford in 1943 and graduated in 1947 with Second-Class Honours in the four-year Chemistry Bachelor of Science degree, specialising in X-ray crystallography under the supervision of Dorothy Hodgkin. Her dissertation was on the structure of the antibiotic gramicidin.  Even while working on chemistry, she was already thinking towards law and politics. She was reportedly more proud of becoming the first Prime Minister with a science degree than the first female Prime Minister. \n\nRoberts became President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1946. She was influenced at university by political works such as Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom (1944), which condemned economic intervention by government as a precursor to an authoritarian state. After graduating, Roberts moved to Colchester in Essex to work as a research chemist for BX Plastics. In 1948 she applied for a job at ICI, but was rejected after the personnel department assessed her as \"headstrong, obstinate and dangerously self-opinionated\".  Roberts joined the local Conservative Association and attended the party conference at Llandudno in 1948, as a representative of the University Graduate Conservative Association. One of her Oxford friends was also a friend of the Chair of the Dartford Conservative Association in Kent, who were looking for candidates. Officials of the association were so impressed by her that they asked her to apply, even though she was not on the Conservative Party's approved list: she was selected in January 1951, aged 25, and added to the approved list post ante. At a dinner following her formal adoption as Conservative candidate for Dartford in February 1951 she met Denis Thatcher, a successful and wealthy divorced businessman, who drove her to her Essex train. In preparation for the election Roberts moved to Dartford, where she supported herself by working as a research chemist for J. Lyons and Co. in Hammersmith, part of a team developing emulsifiers for ice cream. \n\nEarly political career\n\nIn the 1950 and 1951 general elections, Roberts was the Conservative candidate for the safe Labour seat of Dartford. The local party selected her as its candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, Roberts was well-prepared and fearless in her answers; another prospective candidate recalled that \"Once she opened her mouth, the rest of us began to look rather second-rate\". She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate. She lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds, but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000. During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951.  Denis funded his wife's studies for the bar; she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation. Later that same year their twins Carol and Mark were born, delivered by Caesarean section.\n\nThe marriage led to her being referred to as \"Mrs Denis Thatcher\" – now considered dated  – by such official sources as selection minutes,  travel itineraries,  and society publications such as Queen, even after her election as a Member of Parliament, after which she preferred \"Mrs Margaret Thatcher\". \n\nMember of Parliament: 1959–70\n\nIn 1954, Thatcher was defeated when she sought selection to be the Conservative party candidate for the Orpington by-election of January 1955. She chose not to stand as a candidate in the 1955 general election, in later years stating \"I really just felt the twins were ... only two, I really felt that it was too soon.  I couldn't do that.\" Afterwards, Thatcher began looking for a Conservative safe seat and was selected as the candidate for Finchley in April 1958 (narrowly beating Ian Montagu Fraser). She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the 1959 election.  Benefiting from her fortunate result in a lottery for backbenchers to propose new legislation, Thatcher's maiden speech was in support of her private member's bill (Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960), requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public.  In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of birching as a judicial corporal punishment.\n\nThatcher's talent and drive caused her to be mentioned as a future Prime Minister in her early 20s although she herself was more pessimistic, stating as late as 1970 that \"There will not be a woman prime minister in my lifetime—the male population is too prejudiced.\"  In October 1961 she was promoted to the front bench as Parliamentary Undersecretary at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance in Harold Macmillan's administration. Thatcher was the youngest woman in history to receive such a post, and among the first MPs elected in 1959 to be promoted. After the Conservatives lost the 1964 election she became spokeswoman on Housing and Land, in which position she advocated her party's policy of allowing tenants to buy their council houses. She moved to the Shadow Treasury team in 1966 and, as Treasury spokeswoman, opposed Labour's mandatory price and income controls, arguing that they would produce effects contrary to those intended and distort the economy.\n\nBy 1966, party leaders viewed Thatcher as a potential Shadow Cabinet member. James Prior proposed her as a member after the Conservatives' 1966 defeat, but party leader Edward Heath and Chief Whip Willie Whitelaw chose Mervyn Pike as the shadow cabinet's sole woman member.\n\nAt the Conservative Party Conference of 1966 she criticised the high-tax policies of the Labour Government as being steps \"not only towards Socialism, but towards Communism\", arguing that lower taxes served as an incentive to hard work. Thatcher was one of the few Conservative MPs to support Leo Abse's Bill to decriminalise male homosexuality.  She voted in favour of David Steel's bill to legalise abortion,  as well as a ban on hare coursing.  She supported the retention of capital punishment  and voted against the relaxation of divorce laws. \n\nIn 1967, the United States Embassy in London chose Thatcher to take part in the International Visitor Leadership Program (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a professional exchange programme that gave her the opportunity to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although she was not yet a cabinet or shadow cabinet member, the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future prime minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with many prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, and Nelson Rockefeller. After Pike's retirement, Heath appointed Thatcher later that year to the Shadow Cabinet as Fuel and Power spokesman.  Shortly before the 1970 general election, she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education.\n\nEducation Secretary: 1970–74\n\nThe Conservative Party under Edward Heath won the 1970 general election, and Thatcher was subsequently appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science. During her first months in office she attracted public attention as a result of the administration's attempts to cut spending. She gave priority to academic needs in schools. She imposed public expenditure cuts on the state education system, resulting in the abolition of free milk for schoolchildren aged seven to eleven. She held that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk, but agreed to provide younger children with a third of a pint daily, for nutritional purposes. Cabinet papers later revealed that she opposed the policy but had been forced into it by the Treasury.  Her decision provoked a storm of protest from Labour and the press, leading to the moniker \"Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher\".  She reportedly considered leaving politics in the aftermath and later wrote in her autobiography: \"I learned a valuable lesson [from the experience]. I had incurred the maximum of political odium for the minimum of political benefit.\"\n\nThatcher's term of office was marked by proposals for more local education authorities to close grammar schools and to adopt comprehensive secondary education. Although she was committed to a tiered secondary modern-grammar school system of education and was determined to preserve grammar schools, during her tenure as Education Secretary she turned down only 326 of 3,612 proposals for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensive schools consequently rose from 32 per cent to 62 per cent.\n\nLeader of the Opposition: 1975–79\n\nThe Heath government continued to experience difficulties with oil embargoes and union demands for wage increases in 1973 and lost the February 1974 general election. Labour formed a minority government and went on to win a narrow majority in the October 1974 general election. Heath's leadership of the Conservative Party looked increasingly in doubt. Thatcher was not initially the obvious replacement, but she eventually became the main challenger, promising a fresh start. Her main support came from the Conservative 1922 Committee, but Thatcher's time in office gave her the reputation of a pragmatist instead of an ideologue. She defeated Heath on the first ballot and he resigned the leadership.  In the second ballot she defeated Whitelaw, Heath's preferred successor. The vote polarised along right-left lines, with the region, experience and education of the MP also having their effects. Thatcher's support was stronger among MPs on the right, those from southern England, and those who had not attended public schools or Oxbridge. \n\nThatcher became party leader and Leader of the Opposition on 11 February 1975;  she appointed Whitelaw as her deputy. Heath was never reconciled to Thatcher's leadership. \n\nThatcher began to attend lunches regularly at the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a think tank founded by the poultry magnate Antony Fisher, a disciple of Friedrich Hayek; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s. There she was influenced by the ideas of Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon, and she became the face of the ideological movement opposing the welfare state. Keynesian economics, they believed, was weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and more freedom for business and consumers.\n\nTelevision critic Clive James, writing in The Observer during the voting for the leadership, compared her voice of 1973 to a cat sliding down a blackboard. Thatcher had already begun to work on her presentation on the advice of Gordon Reece, a former television producer. By chance Reece met the actor Laurence Olivier, who arranged lessons with the National Theatre's voice coach.  Thatcher succeeded in completely suppressing her Lincolnshire dialect except when under stress, notably after provocation from Denis Healey in the House of Commons in April 1983, when she accused the Labour front bench of being frit.  \n\nOn 19 January 1976 Thatcher made a speech in Kensington Town Hall in which she made a scathing attack on the Soviet Union: \n\nIn response, the Soviet Defence Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) called her the \"Iron Lady,\" a sobriquet she gladly adopted.\n\nMargaret Thatcher wanted to prevent the creation of a Scottish assembly. She told Conservative MPs to vote against the Scotland and Wales Bill in December 1976, which was defeated, and then when new Bills were proposed she supported amending the legislation to allow the English to vote in the 1979 referendum on devolution. \n\nBritain's economy during the 1970s was so weak that Foreign Minister James Callaghan warned his fellow Labour Cabinet members in 1974 of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\" In mid-1978, the economy began to improve and opinion polls showed Labour in the lead, with a general election being expected later that year and a Labour win a serious possibility. Now Prime Minister, Callaghan surprised many by announcing on 7 September that there would be no general election that year and he would wait until 1979 before going to the polls. Thatcher reacted to this by branding the Labour government \"chickens\", and Liberal Party leader David Steel joined in, criticising Labour for \"running scared\". \n\nThe Labour government then faced fresh public unease about the direction of the country and a damaging series of strikes during the winter of 1978–79, dubbed the \"Winter of Discontent\". The Conservatives attacked the Labour government's unemployment record, using advertising with the slogan \"Labour Isn't Working\". A general election was called after Callaghan's government lost a motion of no confidence in early 1979. The Conservatives won a 44-seat majority in the House of Commons, and took charge. \n\nPremiership of the United Kingdom: 1979–90\n\nThatcher became Prime Minister on 4 May 1979. Arriving at 10 Downing Street, she said, in a paraphrase of St. Francis of Assisi's prayer Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace:\n\nRelations with the Queen\n\nAs Prime Minister, Thatcher met weekly with Queen Elizabeth II to discuss government business, and their relationship came under close scrutiny.\n\nIn July 1986, The Sunday Times reported claims attributed to the Queen's advisers of a \"rift\" between Buckingham Palace and Downing Street \"over a wide range of domestic and international issues\".\n\nThe Palace issued an official denial, heading off speculation about a possible constitutional crisis. After Thatcher's retirement a senior Palace source again dismissed as \"nonsense\" the \"stereotyped idea\" that she had not got along with the Queen, or that they had fallen out over Thatcherite policies.  Thatcher later wrote: \"I always found the Queen's attitude towards the work of the Government absolutely correct ... stories of clashes between 'two powerful women' were just too good not to make up.\"\n\nEconomy and taxation\n\nThatcher's economic policy was influenced by monetarist thinking and economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. Together with Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe, she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes. She increased interest rates to slow the growth of the money supply and thereby lower inflation, introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing. Her cuts in higher education spending resulted in her being the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister not to be awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Oxford, after a 738 to 319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.  Her new centrally funded City Technology Colleges did not enjoy much success, and the Funding Agency for Schools was set up to control expenditure by opening and closing schools; the Social Market Foundation, a centre-left think tank, described it as having \"an extraordinary range of dictatorial powers\".\n\nSome Heathite Conservatives in the Cabinet, the so-called \"wets\", expressed doubt over Thatcher's policies. The 1981 England riots resulted in the British media discussing the need for a policy U-turn. At the 1980 Conservative Party conference, Thatcher addressed the issue directly, with a speech written by the playwright Ronald Millar that included the lines: \"You turn if you want to. The lady's not for turning!\" \n\nThatcher's job approval rating fell to 23% by December 1980, lower than recorded for any previous Prime Minister. As the recession of the early 1980s deepened she increased taxes, despite concerns expressed in a statement signed by 364 leading economists issued towards the end of March 1981. \n\nBy 1982, the UK began to experience signs of economic recovery; inflation was down to 8.6% from a high of 18%, but unemployment was over 3 million for the first time since the 1930s.  By 1983 overall economic growth was stronger and inflation and mortgage rates were at their lowest levels since 1970, although manufacturing output had dropped by 30% since 1978  and unemployment remained high, peaking at 3.3 million in 1984. \n\nBy 1987, unemployment was falling, the economy was stable and strong, and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and local council election results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to call a general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The election saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.  Throughout the 1980s revenue from the 90% tax on North Sea oil extraction was used as a short-term funding source to balance the economy and pay the costs of reform.\n\nThatcher reformed local government taxes by replacing domestic rates – a tax based on the nominal rental value of a home – with the Community Charge (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident.  The new tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year, and proved to be among the most unpopular policies of her premiership. Public disquiet culminated in a 70,000 to 200,000-strong  demonstration in London on 31 March 1990; the demonstration around Trafalgar Square deteriorated into the Poll Tax Riots, leaving 113 people injured and 340 under arrest.  The Community Charge was abolished by her successor, John Major.\n\nIndustrial relations\n\nThatcher was committed to reducing the power of the trade unions, whose leadership she accused of undermining parliamentary democracy and economic performance through strike action. Several unions launched strikes in response to legislation introduced to curb their power, but resistance eventually collapsed.  Only 39% of union members voted for Labour in the 1983 general election.  According to the BBC, Thatcher \"managed to destroy the power of the trade unions for almost a generation\". \n\nThe miners' strike was the biggest confrontation between the unions and the Thatcher government. In March 1984 the National Coal Board (NCB) proposed to close 20 of the 174 state-owned mines and cut 20,000 jobs out of 187,000.\n\nTwo-thirds of the country's miners, led by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) under Arthur Scargill, downed tools in protest.  Scargill had refused to hold a ballot on the strike,  having previously lost three ballots on a national strike (January 1982, October 1982, and March 1983).  This led to the strike being declared illegal.  \n\nThatcher refused to meet the union's demands and compared the miners' dispute to the Falklands conflict two years earlier, declaring in a speech in 1984: \"We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands. We always have to be aware of the enemy within, which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty.\" After a year out on strike, in March 1985, the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The cost to the economy was estimated to be at least £1.5 billion, and the strike was blamed for much of the pound's fall against the US dollar. The government closed 25 unprofitable coal mines in 1985, and by 1992 a total of 97 had been closed; those that remained were privatised in 1994.  The eventual closure of 150 coal mines, not all of which were losing money, resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and devastated entire communities.  Miners had helped bring down the Heath government, and Thatcher was determined to succeed where he had failed. Her strategy of preparing fuel stocks, appointing a union-busting NCB leader in Ian MacGregor, and ensuring police were adequately trained and equipped with riot gear, contributed to her victory.\n\nThe number of stoppages across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, when more than 29 million working days were lost. In 1984, the year of the miners' strike, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more than 27 million working days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990 there were 630 and fewer than 2 million working days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter. Thatcher's time in office witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985.  In 1979 up until Thatcher's last year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5 million in 1979 to fewer than 10 million.\n\nPrivatisation\n\nThe policy of privatisation has been called \"a crucial ingredient of Thatcherism\". After the 1983 election the sale of state utilities accelerated; more than £29 billion was raised from the sale of nationalised industries, and another £18 billion from the sale of council houses.\n\nThe process of privatisation, especially the preparation of nationalised industries for privatisation, was associated with marked improvements in performance, particularly in terms of labour productivity.\n\nSome of the privatised industries, including gas, water, and electricity, were natural monopolies for which privatisation involved little increase in competition. The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement sometimes did so while still under state ownership. British Steel Corporation, for instance, made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed chairmanship of Ian MacGregor, who faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and reduce the workforce by half.  Regulation was also significantly expanded to compensate for the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies such as Ofgas, Oftel and the National Rivers Authority. There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition, regulation, and performance among the privatised industries; in most cases privatisation benefited consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency, but the results overall were \"mixed\".\n\nThatcher always resisted rail privatisation and was said to have told Transport Secretary Nicholas Ridley \"Railway privatisation will be the Waterloo of this government. Please never mention the railways to me again.\" Shortly before her resignation, she accepted the arguments for privatising British Rail, which her successor John Major implemented in 1994. The effect of privatising the railway is disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy and concern about foreign companies running British railways.\n\nThe privatisation of public assets was combined with financial deregulation in an attempt to fuel economic growth. Geoffrey Howe abolished Britain's exchange controls in 1979, allowing more capital to be invested in foreign markets, and the Big Bang of 1986 removed many restrictions on the London Stock Exchange. The Thatcher government encouraged growth in the finance and service sectors to compensate for Britain's ailing manufacturing industry.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nIn 1980 and 1981, Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners in Northern Ireland's Maze Prison carried out hunger strikes in an effort to regain the status of political prisoners that had been removed in 1976 by the preceding Labour government.\n\nBobby Sands began the 1981 strike, saying that he would fast until death unless prison inmates won concessions over their living conditions.  Thatcher refused to countenance a return to political status for the prisoners, declaring \"Crime is crime is crime; it is not political\", but nevertheless the UK government privately contacted republican leaders in a bid to bring the hunger strikes to an end.  After the deaths of Sands and nine others, the strike ended. Some rights were restored to paramilitary prisoners, but not official recognition of political status. Violence in Northern Ireland escalated significantly during the hunger strikes; in 1982 Sinn Féin politician Danny Morrison described Thatcher as \"the biggest bastard we have ever known\".\n\nThatcher narrowly escaped injury in an IRA assassination attempt at a Brighton hotel early in the morning on 12 October 1984.  Five people were killed, including the wife of Cabinet Minister John Wakeham. Thatcher was staying at the hotel to attend the Conservative Party Conference, which she insisted should open as scheduled the following day. She delivered her speech as planned, a move that was widely supported across the political spectrum and enhanced her popularity with the public. \n\nOn 6 November 1981, Thatcher and Irish Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had established the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council, a forum for meetings between the two governments.  On 15 November 1985, Thatcher and FitzGerald signed the Hillsborough Anglo-Irish Agreement, the first time a British government had given the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland. In protest the Ulster Says No movement attracted 100,000 to a rally in Belfast,  Ian Gow resigned as Minister of State in the HM Treasury,  and all fifteen Unionist MPs resigned their parliamentary seats; only one was not returned in the subsequent by-elections on 23 January 1986.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThatcher supported an active climate protection policy and was instrumental in the creation of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and in founding the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the British Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter.Alice Bell, [http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-green-hero \"Greenwashing Thatcher's history does an injustice both to her and to science and technology policy\"], TheGuardian.com, 9 April 2013. Thatcher helped to put climate change, acid rain and general pollution in the British mainstream in the early 1980s. Her speeches included one to Royal Society on 27 September 1988  and to the UN general assembly in November 1989. She did not visit the Earth Summit 1992 and later became sceptical about climate change policy.\n\nForeign affairs\n\nThatcher's first foreign policy crisis came with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. She condemned the invasion, said it showed the bankruptcy of a détente policy, and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics. She gave weak support to American President Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with economic sanctions. Britain's economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties.  It was reported that her government secretly supplied Saddam Hussein with military equipment as early as 1981. \n\nThatcher became closely aligned with the Cold War policies of United States President Ronald Reagan, based on their shared distrust of Communism, although she strongly opposed Reagan's October 1983 invasion of Grenada. Reagan had assured Thatcher that an invasion was not contemplated, and thereafter Thatcher felt she could never fully trust Reagan again.  During her first year as Prime Minister she supported NATO's decision to deploy US nuclear cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe and permitted the US to station more than 160 cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common, starting on 14 November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She bought the Trident nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK's nuclear forces  at an eventual cost of more than £12 billion (at 1996–97 prices).  Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the Westland affair of January 1986, when she acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer Westland to refuse a takeover offer from the Italian firm Agusta in favour of the management's preferred option, a link with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. The UK Defence Secretary, Michael Heseltine, who had supported the Agusta deal, resigned in protest.\n\nOn 2 April 1982 the ruling military junta in Argentina ordered the invasion of the British-controlled Falkland Islands and South Georgia, triggering the Falklands War. The subsequent crisis was \"a defining moment of her [Thatcher's] premiership\". At the suggestion of Harold Macmillan and Robert Armstrong, she set up and chaired a small War Cabinet (formally called ODSA, Overseas and Defence committee, South Atlantic) to take charge of the conduct of the war,  which by 5–6 April had authorised and dispatched a naval task force to retake the islands. Argentina surrendered on 14 June and the operation was hailed a success, notwithstanding the deaths of 255 British servicemen and 3 Falkland Islanders. Argentinian deaths totalled 649, half of them after the nuclear-powered submarine  torpedoed and sank the cruiser ARA General Belgrano on 2 May. Thatcher was criticised for the neglect of the Falklands' defence that led to the war, and especially by Tam Dalyell in parliament for the decision to sink the General Belgrano, but overall she was considered a highly capable and committed war leader. The \"Falklands factor\", an economic recovery beginning early in 1982, and a bitterly divided opposition all contributed to Thatcher's second election victory in 1983.  Thatcher often referred after the war to the \"Falklands Spirit\"; Hastings and Jenkins (1983) suggested that this reflected her preference for the streamlined decision-making of her War Cabinet over the painstaking deal-making of peace-time cabinet government.\n\nIn September 1982 she visited China to discuss with Deng Xiaoping the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. China was the first communist state Thatcher had visited and she was the first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, she sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. Deng stated that the PRC's sovereignty on Hong Kong was non-negotiable, but he was willing to settle the sovereignty issue with Britain through formal negotiations, and both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.  After the two-year negotiations, Thatcher conceded to the PRC government and signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997.\n\nAlthough saying that she was in favour of \"peaceful negotiations\" to end apartheid,  Thatcher stood against the sanctions imposed on South Africa by the Commonwealth and the EC. She attempted to preserve trade with South Africa while persuading the government there to abandon apartheid. This included \"[c]asting herself as President Botha's candid friend\", and inviting him to visit the UK in June 1984, in spite of the \"inevitable demonstrations\" against his government. Thatcher dismissed the African National Congress (ANC) in October 1987 as \"a typical terrorist organisation\". \n\nThe Thatcher government supported the Khmer Rouge keeping their seat in the UN after they were ousted from power in Cambodia by the Cambodian–Vietnamese War. Although denying it at the time they also sent the SAS to train the non-Communist members of the CGDK to fight against the Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea government.  \n\nThatcher's antipathy towards European integration became more pronounced during her premiership, particularly after her third election victory in 1987. During a 1988 speech in Bruges she outlined her opposition to proposals from the European Community (EC), forerunner of the European Union, for a federal structure and increased centralisation of decision making.  Thatcher and her party had supported British membership of the EC in the 1975 national referendum,  but she believed that the role of the organisation should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that the EC's approach was at odds with her views on smaller government and deregulation; in 1988, she remarked, \"We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels\".\n\nThatcher was firmly opposed to the UK's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a precursor to European monetary union, believing that it would constrain the British economy,  despite the urging of her Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, but she was persuaded by John Major to join in October 1990, at what proved to be too high a rate.\n\nIn April 1986, Thatcher permitted US F-111s to use Royal Air Force bases for the bombing of Libya in retaliation for the alleged Libyan bombing of a Berlin discothèque, citing the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.  Polls suggested that fewer than one in three British citizens approved of Thatcher's decision.  She was in the US on a state visit when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded neighbouring Kuwait in August 1990.  During her talks with President George H. W. Bush, who had succeeded Reagan in 1989, she recommended intervention, and put pressure on Bush to deploy troops in the Middle East to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait.  Bush was apprehensive about the plan, prompting Thatcher to remark to him during a telephone conversation that \"This was no time to go wobbly!\"  Thatcher's government provided military forces to the international coalition in the build-up to the Gulf War, but she had resigned by the time hostilities began on 17 January 1991.\n\nThatcher was one of the first Western leaders to respond warmly to reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Following Reagan–Gorbachev summit meetings and reforms enacted by Gorbachev in the USSR, she declared in November 1988 that \"We're not in a Cold War now\", but rather in a \"new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was\".  She went on a state visit to the Soviet Union in 1984 and met with Gorbachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers.  Thatcher was initially opposed to German reunification, telling Gorbachev that it \"would lead to a change to postwar borders, and we cannot allow that because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security\". She expressed concern that a united Germany would align itself more closely with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO.\n\nChallenges to leadership and resignation\n\nThatcher was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by the little-known backbench MP Sir Anthony Meyer in the 1989 leadership election.  Of the 374 Conservative MPs eligible to vote, 314 voted for Thatcher and 33 for Meyer. Her supporters in the party viewed the result as a success, and rejected suggestions that there was discontent within the party.\n\nDuring her premiership Thatcher had the second-lowest average approval rating, at 40%, of any post-war Prime Minister. Polls consistently showed that she was less popular than her party.  A self-described conviction politician, Thatcher always insisted that she did not care about her poll ratings, pointing instead to her unbeaten election record. \n\nOpinion polls in September 1990 reported that Labour had established a 14% lead over the Conservatives, and by November the Conservatives had been trailing Labour for 18 months. These ratings, together with Thatcher's combative personality and willingness to override colleagues' opinions, contributed to discontent within the Conservative Party.\n\nOn 1 November 1990, Geoffrey Howe the last remaining member of Thatcher's original 1979 cabinet, resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister over her refusal to agree to a timetable for Britain to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.   In his resignation speech on 13 November, Howe commented on Thatcher's European stance: \"It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find the moment that the first balls are bowled that their bats have been broken before the game by the team captain.\"  His resignation was fatal to Thatcher's premiership. \n\nThe next day, Michael Heseltine mounted a challenge for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Opinion polls had indicated that he would give the Conservatives a national lead over Labour.  Although Thatcher won the first ballot with 204:152 votes and 16 abstentions, Heseltine had attracted sufficient support to force a second ballot. Under party rules, Thatcher not only needed to win a majority, but her margin over Heseltine had to be equivalent to 15% of the 372 Conservative MPs in order to win the leadership election outright; with 54.8% against 40.9% for Heseltine, she came up four votes short.  Thatcher initially stated that she intended to \"fight on and fight to win\" the second ballot, but consultation with her Cabinet persuaded her to withdraw.   After visiting the Queen, calling other world leaders, and making one final Commons speech,  she left Downing Street in tears. She reportedly regarded her ousting as a betrayal.\n\nThatcher was replaced as Prime Minister and party leader by her Chancellor John Major, who prevailed over Heseltine in the subsequent ballots. Major oversaw an upturn in Conservative support in the 17 months leading up to the 1992 general election and led the Conservatives to their fourth successive victory on 9 April 1992.  Thatcher had favoured Major over Heseltine in the leadership contest, but her support for him weakened in later years. \n\nLater life\n\nThatcher returned to the backbenches as MP for Finchley for two years after leaving the premiership. She retired from the House at the 1992 election, aged 66, saying that leaving the Commons would allow her more freedom to speak her mind. \n\nPost-Commons: 1992–2003\n\nAfter leaving the House of Commons, Thatcher became the first former Prime Minister to set up a foundation;  the British wing of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation was dissolved in 2005 because of financial difficulties.  She wrote two volumes of memoirs, The Downing Street Years (1993) and The Path to Power (1995). In 1991, she and her husband Denis moved to a house in Chester Square, a residential garden square in central London's Belgravia district. \n\nIn 1992, Thatcher was hired by the tobacco company Philip Morris as a \"geopolitical consultant\" for $250,000 per year and an annual contribution of $250,000 to her foundation. She also earned $50,000 for each speech she delivered. \n\nIn August 1992, Thatcher called for NATO to stop the Serbian assault on Goražde and Sarajevo to end ethnic cleansing during the Bosnian War. She compared the situation in Bosnia to \"the worst excesses of the Nazis\", and warned that there could be a \"holocaust\".  She had been an advocate of Croatian and Slovenian independence. \n\nIn a 1991 interview for Croatian Radiotelevision, Thatcher had commented on the Yugoslav Wars; she was critical of Western governments for not recognising the breakaway republics of Croatia and Slovenia as independent states and for not supplying them with arms after the Serbian-led Yugoslav Army attacked. \n\nShe made a series of speeches in the Lords criticising the Maastricht Treaty, describing it as \"a treaty too far\" and stated \"I could never have signed this treaty\".  She cited A. V. Dicey when stating that as all three main parties were in favour of the treaty, the people should have their say in a referendum. \n\nThatcher was honorary Chancellor of the College of William & Mary in Virginia (1993–2000)  and also of the University of Buckingham (1992–99), the UK's first private university, which she had opened in 1975. \n\nAfter Tony Blair's election as Labour Party leader in 1994, Thatcher praised Blair in an interview as \"probably the most formidable Labour leader since Hugh Gaitskell. I see a lot of socialism behind their front bench, but not in Mr Blair. I think he genuinely has moved\". \n\nIn 1998, Thatcher called for the release of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet when Spain had him arrested and sought to try him for human rights violations. She cited the help he gave Britain during the Falklands War.  In 1999, she visited him while he was under house arrest near London.  Pinochet was released in March 2000 on medical grounds by the Home Secretary Jack Straw, without facing trial. \n\nIn the 2001 general election, Thatcher supported the Conservative general election campaign, as she had done in 1992 and 1997, and in the Conservative leadership election shortly after, she supported Iain Duncan Smith over Kenneth Clarke. \n\nIn 2002, Thatcher encouraged President George W. Bush to aggressively tackle the \"unfinished business\" of Saddam Hussein's Iraq,  and praised Tony Blair for his \"strong, bold leadership\" in standing with Bush in the Iraq War. \n\nShe broached the same subject in her Statecraft: Strategies for a Changing World, which was published that year and dedicated to Ronald Reagan, writing that there would be no peace in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein was toppled. Her book also said that Israel must trade land for peace, and that the European Union (EU) was \"fundamentally unreformable\", \"a classic utopian project, a monument to the vanity of intellectuals, a programme whose inevitable destiny is failure\".  She argued that Britain should renegotiate its terms of membership or else leave the EU and join the North American Free Trade Area. \n\nThat same year, she suffered several small strokes and was advised by her doctors not to engage in further public speaking.  On 23 March, she announced that on the advice of her doctors she would cancel all planned speaking engagements and accept no more.\n\nHusband's death: 2003\n\nSir Denis Thatcher died of pancreatic cancer on 26 June 2003 and was cremated on 3 July.  She had paid tribute to him in The Downing Street Years, writing \"Being Prime Minister is a lonely job. In a sense, it ought to be: you cannot lead from the crowd. But with Denis there I was never alone. What a man. What a husband. What a friend.\"\n\nFinal years: 2003–13\n\nOn 11 June 2004, Thatcher, against doctor's orders, attended the state funeral service for Ronald Reagan.  She delivered her eulogy via videotape; in view of her health, the message had been pre-recorded several months earlier.  Thatcher flew to California with the Reagan entourage, and attended the memorial service and interment ceremony for the president at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. \n\nThatcher celebrated her 80th birthday at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hyde Park, London, on 13 October 2005; guests included the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Alexandra and Tony Blair.  Geoffrey Howe, by then Lord Howe of Aberavon, was also present, and said of his former leader: \"Her real triumph was to have transformed not just one party but two, so that when Labour did eventually return, the great bulk of Thatcherism was accepted as irreversible.\" \n\nAccording to a later article in The Daily Telegraph, Thatcher's daughter Carol first revealed that her mother had dementia in 2005, saying that \"Mum doesn't read much any more because of her memory loss ... It's pointless. She can't remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she reaches the end.\" She later recounted how she was first struck by her mother's dementia when in conversation Thatcher confused the Falklands and Yugoslav conflicts; she recalled the pain of needing to tell her mother repeatedly that Denis Thatcher was dead. \n\nIn 2006, Thatcher attended the official Washington, D.C. memorial service to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States. She was a guest of Vice President Dick Cheney, and met Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit. \n\nIn February 2007, Thatcher became the first living British Prime Minister to be honoured with a statue in the Houses of Parliament. The bronze statue stands opposite that of her political hero, Sir Winston Churchill, and was unveiled on 21 February 2007 with Thatcher in attendance; she made a brief speech in the members' lobby of the House of Commons, responding: \"I might have preferred iron—but bronze will do ... It won't rust.\" \n\nShe was a public supporter of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism and the resulting Prague Process, and sent a public letter of support to its preceding conference. \n\nAfter collapsing at a House of Lords dinner, Thatcher was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital in central London on 7 March 2008 for tests. In 2009 she was hospitalised again when she fell and broke her arm. \n\nThatcher returned to 10 Downing Street in late November 2009 for the unveiling of an official portrait by artist Richard Stone, an unusual honour for a living ex-Prime Minister. Stone had previously painted portraits of the Queen and the Queen Mother.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Thatcher was to attend a ceremony for the unveiling of a 10-foot statue to former American President Ronald Reagan, outside the American Embassy in London, but was unable to attend due to her frail health.  On 31 July 2011, it was announced that her office in the House of Lords had been closed.  Earlier that month, Thatcher had been named the most competent British Prime Minister of the past 30 years in an Ipsos MORI poll. \n\nDeath and funeral: 2013\n\nLady Thatcher died on 8 April 2013 at the age of 87 after suffering a stroke. She had been staying at a suite in the Ritz Hotel in London since December 2012 after having difficulty with stairs at her Chester Square home in Belgravia. \n\nReactions to the news of Thatcher's death were mixed in the UK, ranging from tributes lauding her as Britain's greatest-ever peacetime Prime Minister to public celebrations of her death and expressions of personalised vitriol. \n\nDetails of Thatcher's funeral had been agreed with her in advance.  She received a ceremonial funeral, including full military honours, with a church service at St Paul's Cathedral on 17 April.  \n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, attended the funeral,  the second time in the Queen's reign that she had attended the funeral of a former prime minister (the first being that of Winston Churchill in 1965). \n\nAfter the service at St Paul's Cathedral, Thatcher's body was cremated at Mortlake Crematorium, where her husband had been cremated. On 28 September a service for Thatcher was held in the All Saints Chapel of the Royal Hospital Chelsea's Margaret Thatcher Infirmary. In a private ceremony Thatcher's ashes were interred in the grounds of the hospital, next to those of her husband.\n\nLegacy\n\nPolitical legacy\n\nThatcherism represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the post-war consensus, whereby the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of Keynesianism, the welfare state, nationalised industry, and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular. She promised Britons in 1982, the NHS is \"safe in our hands.\" \n\nThatcher defined her own political philosophy in a major and controversial break with One Nation Conservatives like her predecessor Edward Heath,  in her statement to Douglas Keay, published in Woman's Own magazine in September 1987:\n\nThe number of adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure, and more than a million families bought their council houses, giving an increase from 55 per cent to 67 per cent in owner-occupiers from 1979 to 1990. The houses were sold at a discount of 33–55 per cent, leading to large profits for some new owners. Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below their market value to ensure quick and wide sales, rather than maximise national income.\n\nThatcher's premiership was also marked by periods of high unemployment and social unrest, and many critics on the left of the political spectrum fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by high unemployment as well as her monetarist economic policies remain blighted by social problems such as drug abuse and family breakdown.\n\nSpeaking in Scotland in April 2009, before the 30th anniversary of her election as Prime Minister, Thatcher insisted she had no regrets and was right to introduce the poll tax, and to withdraw subsidies from \"outdated industries, whose markets were in terminal decline\", subsidies that created \"the culture of dependency, which had done such damage to Britain\".  Political economist Susan Strange called the new financial growth model \"casino capitalism\", reflecting her view that speculation and financial trading were becoming more important to the economy than industry.\n\nCritics on the left describe her as \"divisive\"  and claim she promoted greed and selfishness. Michael White, writing in the New Statesman in February 2009, challenged the view that her reforms had brought a net benefit.  Some critics contend that, despite being Britain's first woman Prime Minister, Thatcher did \"little to advance the political cause of women\", either within her party or the government, and some British feminists  regarded her as \"an enemy\". Her stance on immigration was perceived by some as part of a rising racist public discourse, which Professor Martin Barker  called \"new racism\".\n\nInfluenced at the outset by Keith Joseph, the term \"Thatcherism\" came to refer to her policies as well as aspects of her ethical outlook and personal style, including moral absolutism, nationalism, interest in the individual, and an uncompromising approach to achieving political goals.  The nickname \"Iron Lady\", originally given to her by the Soviets, became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style.  \n\nThatcher's tenure of 11 years and 209 days as Prime Minister was the longest since Lord Salisbury (13 years and 252 days in three spells starting in 1885), and the longest continuous period in office since Lord Liverpool (14 years and 305 days starting in 1812). \n\nShe was voted the fourth-greatest British Prime Minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by MORI,  and in 2002 was ranked number 16 in the BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.  In 1999, Time magazine named Thatcher one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. \n\nThatcher's death prompted mixed reactions, including reflections of criticism as well as praise.    Groups celebrated her death in Brixton, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow,    and a crowd of 3,000 gathered in Trafalgar Square to celebrate her demise and protest against her legacy. \n\nShortly after Thatcher's death, Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond, argued that her policies had the \"unintended consequence\" of encouraging Scottish devolution.  Lord Foulkes agreed on Scotland Tonight that she had provided \"the impetus\" for devolution. \n\nCultural depictions\n\nOne of the earliest satires of Thatcher as Prime Minister involved Wells (as writer/performer), Janet Brown (voicing Thatcher) and future Spitting Image producer John Lloyd, who in 1979 were teamed up by producer Martin Lewis for the satirical audio album The Iron Lady consisting of skits and songs satirising Thatcher's rise to power. The album was released in September 1979, four months after Thatcher became Premier.  \n\nThatcher was the subject or the inspiration for 1980s protest songs. Billy Bragg and Paul Weller helped to form the Red Wedge collective to support Labour in opposition to Thatcher.\n\nThatcher was lampooned by satirist John Wells in several media. Wells collaborated with Richard Ingrams on the spoof \"Dear Bill\" letters which ran as a column in Private Eye magazine, were published in book form, and later became a West End stage revue named Anyone for Denis?, with Wells in the role of Denis Thatcher. The revue was followed by a 1982 TV special, directed by Dick Clement, in which Thatcher was portrayed by Angela Thorne.  Spitting Image, a British TV show, satirised Thatcher as a bully who ridiculed her own ministers. She was voiced by Steve Nallon. \n\nMargaret Thatcher has been depicted in many television programmes, documentaries, films and plays. She was played by Patricia Hodge in Ian Curteis's long unproduced The Falklands Play (2002), and by Andrea Riseborough in the TV film The Long Walk to Finchley (2008). She is the title character in two films, portrayed by Lindsay Duncan in Margaret (2009) and by Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady (2011),  in which she is depicted as suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's disease. \n\nTitles, awards and honours\n\nThatcher became a Privy Councillor (PC) upon becoming Secretary of State for Education and Science in 1970. \n\nShe was the first woman entitled to full membership rights as an honorary member of the Carlton Club on becoming leader of the Conservative Party in 1975.  Thatcher became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry (FRIC) in 1979. \n\nThatcher was bestowed with the Grand Cross of the Order of Good Hope, which was, at that time, the highest existing South African award, in 1991, by President F. W. de Klerk. \n\nThatcher was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1983, which caused controversy among some of the then-existing Fellows.\n\nWithin two weeks of leaving office in 1990, Thatcher was appointed a Member of the Order of Merit (OM) (an order within the personal gift of the Queen). Her husband, Denis Thatcher, was made a Baronet at the same time. \n\nIn the Falklands, Margaret Thatcher Day has been marked every 10 January since 1992,  commemorating her visit in 1983. Thatcher Drive in Stanley is named for her, as is Thatcher Peninsula in South Georgia, where the task force troops first set foot on the Falklands.\n\nShe became member of the House of Lords in 1992 with a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire.  She was appointed a Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter (LG), the UK's highest order of chivalry, in 1995. \n\nShe was a patron of The Heritage Foundation,  which established the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom in 2005."

                "Hell's Kitchen is a British cookery reality show, aired on ITV, which features prospective chefs competing with each other for a final prize. Four series were aired from 2004 to 2009, three presented by Angus Deayton and the most recent by Claudia Winkleman.\n\nCast\n\nThe show had different formats and different head chefs for each of the first three seasons. The original chef Gordon Ramsay subsequently signed an exclusive United Kingdom contract with Channel 4, ruling out any possibility of him appearing on future episodes of the ITV-produced show. \n\nSeries synopses\n\nSeries 1 (2004)\n\nSeries 1 of Hell's Kitchen in the UK was broadcast from 23 May – 6 June 2004, airing live nightly for two weeks.\n\nThe premise was head chef Gordon Ramsay teaching ten celebrities how to cook. The celebrities were placed in a specially constructed London restaurant-kitchen with the task of catering for a clientele of famous people. Eliminations were determined by a series of public votes (in the style of Big Brother).\n\nJennifer Ellison was declared the winner. A follow-up programme was made afterwards called Hell's Kitchen: School Reunion, which saw Ellison and the show runner-up, James Dreyfus, team up to organise a healthy dinner service for the children at Ramsay's former school, Stratford Upon Avon High School.\n\nThe celebrities who took part were:\n\nSeries 2 (2005)\n\nSeries 2 of Hell's Kitchen in the UK was broadcast from 18 April – 2 May 2005.\n\nThe format was overhauled as the show was turned into a competition between two kitchens run by \"celebrity chefs\" Gary Rhodes and Jean-Christophe Novelli. The second series featured ten members of the public competing for a prize of £250,000, with which the winner could start his or her own restaurant. They were split into two teams of six, one red (tutored by Gary Rhodes) and the other blue (led by Jean-Christophe Novelli). A new and much larger restaurant was built to accommodate the fact that there were now two kitchens.\n\nThe only things that remained the same in the second series were the music, by composer Daniel Pemberton, and the presenter, who was still Angus Deayton. Elimination was still down to voting.\n\nThe series was won by Terry Miller.\n\nThe contestants who took part were:\n*Blue Team (Head chef Jean-Christophe Novelli)\n**Henry Filloux-Bennett\n**Aby King\n**Rory O'Donnell\n**Gary Tomlin\n**Kellie Cresswell\n**Stien Smart\n*Red Team (Head chef Gary Rhodes)\n**Terry Miller\n**Simon Gross\n**Aaron Siwoku\n**Tom Paisley\n**Caroline Garvey\n**Sam Raplin\n\nSeries 3 (2007)\n\nSeries 3 was due to begin in mid-2006, with Jean-Christophe Novelli as the sole head chef; however, ITV made the decision to take a break from producing Hell's Kitchen. The network then announced in February 2007 that it had commissioned a new series of the show, to begin in late 2007.\n\nThe new series began on 3 September 2007 at 9:00 pm. Michelin starred Marco Pierre White was the new head chef. White had two sous chefs, Matthew and Timothy. The series reverted to the original format of having celebrities as contestants.\n\nThe series ended on 17 September 2007, with Barry McGuigan crowned winner.\n\nThe contestants who took part were:\n\nSeries 4 (2009)\n\nSeries 4 began on 13 April 2009.  Marco Pierre White returns as Head Chef/teacher. Claudia Winkleman took over as host, replacing Angus Deayton.    Nick Munier returned as Maitre d', as did Sous Chefs Matthew and Timothy. This series there was one kitchen with grey and dark red tiles. The first four sackings were Marco's responsibility, while the other four sackings were down to a public vote (the person with the lowest amount of votes left Hell's Kitchen).\n\nLinda Evans won from public voting on 27 April 2009.\n\nThe celebrities who took part were:\n\nInternational versions\n\nCurrently airing franchise\nFranchise no longer in production"

                "Platelets, also called thrombocytes (thromb- + -cyte, \"blood clot cell\"), are a component of blood whose function (along with the coagulation factors) is to stop bleeding by clumping and clotting blood vessel injuries.  Platelets have no cell nucleus: they are fragments of cytoplasm that are derived from the megakaryocytes  of the bone marrow, and then enter the circulation. These unactivated platelets are biconvex discoid (lens-shaped) structures,    2–3 µm in greatest diameter.  Platelets are found only in mammals, whereas in other animals (e.g. birds, amphibians) thrombocytes circulate as intact mononuclear cells. \n\nOn a stained blood smear, platelets appear as dark purple spots, about 20% the diameter of red blood cells. The smear is used to examine platelets for size, shape, qualitative number, and clumping. The ratio of platelets to red blood cells in a healthy adult is 1:10 to 1:20.\n\nThe main function of platelets is to contribute to hemostasis: the process of stopping bleeding at the site of interrupted endothelium. They gather at the site and unless the interruption is physically too large, they plug the hole. First, platelets attach to substances outside the interrupted endothelium: adhesion. Second, they change shape, turn on receptors and secrete chemical messengers: activation. Third, they connect to each other through receptor bridges: aggregation.  Formation of this platelet plug (primary hemostasis) is associated with activation of the coagulation cascade with resultant fibrin deposition and linking (secondary hemostasis). These processes may overlap: the spectrum is from a predominantly platelet plug, or \"white clot\" to a predominantly fibrin clot, or \"red clot\" or the more typical mixture. The final result is the clot. Some would add the subsequent clot retraction and platelet inhibition as fourth and fifth steps to the completion of the process  and still others a sixth step wound repair.\n\nLow platelet concentration is thrombocytopenia and is due to either decreased production or increased destruction. Elevated platelet concentration is thrombocytosis and is either congenital, reactive (to cytokines), or due to unregulated production: one of the myeloprolerative neoplasms or certain other myeloid neoplasms. A disorder of platelet function is a thrombocytopathy.\n\nNormal platelets can respond to an abnormality on the vessel wall rather than to hemorrhage, resulting in inappropriate platelet adhesion/activation and thrombosis: the formation of a clot within an intact vessel. These arise by different mechanisms than a normal clot. Examples are: extending the fibrin clot of venous thrombosis; extending an unstable or ruptured arterial plaque, causing arterial thrombosis; and microcirculatory thrombosis. An arterial thrombus may partially obstruct blood flow, causing downstream ischemia; or completely obstruct it, causing downstream tissue death.\n\nDiscovery, early observations, and naming\n\nGeorge Gulliver in 1841 drew pictures of platelets  using the twin lens (compound) microscope invented in 1830 by Joseph Jackson Lister. \nThis microscope improved resolution sufficiently to make it possible to see platelets for the first time. William Addison in 1842 drew pictures of a platelet-fibrin clot.   Lionel Beale in 1864 was the first to publish a drawing showing platelets.  Max Schultze in 1865 described what he called \"spherules\", which he noted were much smaller than red blood cells, occasionally clumped, and were sometimes found in collections of fibrin material. Queen's College, Birmingham (a predecessor college of Birmingham University) physician Dr Richard Hill Norris was the first to describe the action of platelets in 1880.  Giulio Bizzozero in 1882 studied the blood of amphibians microscopically in vivo. He named Schultz's spherules (It.) piastrine: little plates. William Osler observed them and, in published lectures in 1886, called them a third corpuscle and a blood plaque  and described them as a colorless protoplasmic disc.  James Wright examined blood smears using the stain named for him, and used the term  plates in his 1906 publication  but changed to platelets in his 1910 publication  which has become the universally accepted term.\n\nThe term thrombocyte (clot cell)  came into use in the early 1900s and is sometimes used as a synonym for platelet; but not generally in the scientific literature, except as a root word for other terms related to platelets (e.g.  thrombocytopenia meaning low platelets). Thrombocytes are cells found in the blood of non-mammalian vertebrates. They are the functional equivalents of platelets, but circulate as intact mononuclear cells, and are not simply cytoplasmic fragments of bone marrow megakaryocytes.\n\nIn some contexts, the word thrombus is used interchangeably with the word clot, regardless of its composition (white, red, or mixed). In other contexts it is used to contrast a normal from an abnormal clot: thrombus arises from physiologic hemostasis, thrombosis arises from a pathologic and excessive quantity of clot.  In a third context it is used to contrast the result from the process: thrombus is the result, thrombosis is the process.\n\nMeasurement\n\nPlatelet concentration is measured either manually using a hemocytometer, or by placing blood in an automated platelet analyzer using electrical impedance, such as a Coulter counter.  The normal range (99% of population analyzed) for platelets in healthy Caucasians is 150,000 to 450,000 per cubic millimeter  (a mm3 equals a microliter). or 150–400 × 109 per litre. The normal range has been confirmed to be the same in the elderly  and Spanish  populations. Men as a group have slightly higher mean values than women.\n\nThe platelet concentration is often referred to informally as the platelet count\nwithout stating the units.\n\nStructure\n\nStructurally the platelet can be divided into four zones, from peripheral to innermost: \n*Peripheral zone - is rich in glycoproteins required for platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation. For example, GPIb/IX/X; GPVI; GPIIb/IIIa. \n*Sol-gel zone - is rich in microtubules and microfilaments, allowing the platelets to maintain their discoid shape.\n*Organelle zone - is rich in platelet granules. Alpha granules contain clotting mediators such as factor V, factor VIII, fibrinogen, fibronectin, platelet-derived growth factor, and chemotactic agents. Delta granules, or dense bodies, contain ADP, calcium, serotonin, which are platelet-activating mediators. - \n*Membranous zone - contains membranes derived from megakaryocytic smooth endoplasmic reticulum organized into a dense tubular system which is responsible for thromboxane A2 synthesis. This dense tubular system is connected to the surface platelet membrane to aid thromboxane A2 release.\n\nSymptoms of platelet disorders\n\nSpontaneous and excessive bleeding can occur because of platelet disorders. This bleeding can be caused by deficient numbers of platelets, dysfunctional platelets, or very excessive numbers of platelets: over 1.0 million/microliter. (The excessive numbers create a relative von Willibrand factor deficiency due to sequestration.)  \n\nOne can get a clue as to whether bleeding is due to  a platelet disorder or a coagulation factor disorder by the characteristics and location of the bleeding.  All of the following suggest platelet bleeding, not coagulation bleeding: the bleeding from a skin cut such as a razor nick is prompt and excessive, but can be controlled by pressure; spontaneous bleeding into the skin which causes a purplish stain named by its size: petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses; bleeding into mucous membranes causing bleeding gums, nose bleed, and gastrointestinal bleeding; menorrhagia; and intraretinal and intracranial bleeding.\n\nExcessive numbers of platelets, and/or normal platelets responding to abnormal vessel walls, can result in venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis. The symptoms depend on the site of thrombosis.\n\nKinetics\n\n* Megakaryocyte and platelet production is regulated by thrombopoietin, a hormone produced in the kidneys and liver.\n* Each megakaryocyte produces between 1,000 and 3,000 platelets during its lifetime.\n* An average of 1011 platelets are produced daily in a healthy adult.\n* Reserve platelets are stored in the spleen, and are released when needed by splenic contraction induced by the sympathetic nervous system.\n\n* The average life span of circulating platelets is 8 to 9 days.  Life span of individual platelets is controlled by the internal apoptotic regulating pathway, which has a  Bcl-xL timer.    \n* Old platelets are destroyed by phagocytosis in the spleen and liver.\n\nDynamics\n\nAn overview summarizing platelet dynamics, the complex process of converting inactive platelets into a platelet plug, is essentialEL 2. Complicating any verbal description is the fact that at least 193 proteins and 301 interactions are involved in platelet dynamics.  The separation of platelet dynamics into three stages is useful in this regard, but it is artificial: in fact, each stage is initiated in rapid succession, and each continues until the trigger for that stage is no longer present, so there is overlap.\n\nAdhesion\n\nThrombus formation on an intact endothelium is prevented by nitric oxide,  prostacyclin,  and CD39. \n\nEndothelial cells are attached to the subendothelial collagen by von Willebrand factor (VWF) which these cells produce.  VWF is also stored in the Weibel-Palade bodies of the endothelial cells and secreted constitutively into the blood. Platelets store vWF in their alpha granules.\n\nWhen the endothelial layer is disrupted, collagen and VWF anchor platelets to the subendothelium. Platelet GP1b-IX-V receptor binds with VWF; and GPVI receptor and integrin alpha2beta1 bind with collagen.\n\nActivation\n\nAn overview of platelet activation is a useful introduction to this multifaceted process.\n[EL 3]\n\nInhibition\n\nThe intact endothelial lining inhibits platelet activation by producing nitric oxide, endothelial-ADPase, and PGI2. Endothelial-ADPase degrades the platelet activator ADP.\n\nResting platelets maintain active calcium efflux via a cyclic AMP activated calcium pump. Intracellular calcium concentration determines platelet activation status, as it is the second messenger that drives platelet conformational change and degranulation (see below). Endothelial prostacyclin binds to prostanoid receptors on the surface of resting platelets. This event stimulates the coupled Gs protein to increase adenylate cyclase activity and increases the production of cAMP, further promoting the efflux of calcium and reducing intracellular calcium availability for platelet activation.\n\nADP on the other hand binds to purinergic receptors on platelet surface. Since the thrombocytic purinergic receptor P2Y12 is coupled to Gi proteins, ADP reduces platelet adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP production, leading to accumulation of calcium inside the platelet by inactivating the cAMP calcium efflux pump. The other ADP-receptor P2Y1 couples to Gq that activates phospholipase C-beta 2 PLCB2, resulting in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)generation and intracellular release of more calcium. This together induces platelet activation. Endothelial ADPase degrades ADP and prevents this from happening. Clopidogrel and related antiplatelet medications also work as purinergic receptor P2Y12 antagonists.\n\nTrigger (Induction)\n\nPlatelet activation begins seconds after adhesion occurs. It is triggered  when collagen from the subendothelium binds with its receptors on the platelet. GPVI is associated with the Fc Receptor gamma chain and leads via the activation of a tyrosine kinase cascade finally to the activation of PLC-gamma2 PLCG2 and more calcium release.\n\nTissue factor also binds to factor VII in the blood, which initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade to increase thrombin production. Thrombin is a potent platelet activator, acting through Gq and G12. These are G protein coupled receptors and they turn on calcium mediated signaling pathways within the platelet, overcoming the baseline calcium efflux. Families of three G proteins (Gq, Gi, G12) operate together for full activation. Thrombin also promotes secondary fibrin-reinforcement of the platelet plug. Platelet activation in turn degranulates and releases factor V and fibrinogen, potentiating the coagulation cascade. So in reality the process of platelet plugging and coagulation are occurring simultaneously rather than sequentially, with each inducing the other to form the final clot.\n\nComponents (Consequences)\n\nGPIIb/IIIa activation\n\nCollagen-mediated GPVI signalling increases the platelet production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and decreases the production of prostacyclin. This occurs by altering the metabolic flux of platelet's eicosanoid synthesis pathway, which involves enzymes phospholipase A2, cyclo-oxygenase 1, and thromboxane-A synthase. Platelets secrete thromboxane A2, which acts on the platelet's own thromboxane receptors on the platelet surface (hence the so-called \"out-in\" mechanism), and those of other platelets. These receptors trigger intraplatelet signaling, which converts GPIIb/IIIa receptors to their active form to initiate aggregation.\n\nGranule secretion\n\nPlatelets contain dense granules, lambda granules and alpha granules. Activated platelets secrete the contents of these granules through their canalicular systems to the exterior. Simplistically, bound and activated platelets degranulate to release platelet chemotactic agents to attract more platelets to the site of endothelial injury. Granule characteristics:\n* α granules (alpha granules) – containing P-selectin, platelet factor 4, transforming growth factor-β1, platelet-derived growth factor, fibronectin, B-thromboglobulin, vWF, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors V and XIII).\n* δ granules (delta or dense granules) – containing ADP or ATP, calcium, and serotonin).\n* γ granules (gamma granules) – similar to lysosomes and contain several hydrolytic enzymes.\n* λ granules (lambda granules) – contents involved in clot resorption during later stages of vessel repair.\n\nMorphology change\n\nMitochondria hyperpolarization is a key event in initiating changes in morphology.  Intraplatelet calcium concentration increases, stimulating the interplay between microtubule/actin filament complex. The continuous changes in shape from the unactivated to the fully activated platelet is best seen on scanning electron microscopy.[EL 4] Three steps along this path are named early dendritic, early spread and spread. The surface of the unactivated platelet looks very similar to the surface of the brain, with a wrinkled appearance from numerous shallow folds to increase the surface area; early dendritic, an octopus with multiple arms and legs; early spread, an uncooked frying egg in a pan, the \"yolk\" being the central body; and the spread, a cooked fried egg with a denser central body. These changes are all brought about by the interaction of the microtubule/actin complex with the platelet cell membrane and open canalicular system (OCS), which is an extension and invagination of that membrane. This complex runs just beneath these membranes, and is the chemical motor which literally pulls the invaginated OCS out of the interior of the platelet like turning pants pockets inside out, creating the dendrites.[EL 7] and then spreads each dendrite until the entire OCS becomes indistinguishable from the initial platelet membrane as it forms the \"fried egg\". This dramatic increase in surface area comes about with neither stretching nor adding phospholipids to the platelet membrane. \n\nCoagulation facilitation\n\nPlatelet activation causes its membrane surface to become negatively charged. One of the signaling pathways turns on scramblase, which moves negatively charged phospholipids from the inner to the outer platelet membrane surface. These phospholipids then bind the tenase and prothrombinase complexes, two of the sites of interplay between platelets and the coagulation cascade.  Calcium ions are essential for the binding of these coagulation factors.\n\nAggregation\n\nAggregation begins minutes after activation, and occurs as a result of turning on the GPIIb/IIIa receptor, which allows these receptors to bind with vWF or fibrinogen. There are 50–100 of these receptors per platelet.  When any one or more of at least nine different platelet surface receptors are turned on during activation,  intraplatelet signaling pathways cause  existing GpIIb/IIIa receptors to change shape – curled to straight – and thus become capable of binding.\n\nSince fibrinogen is a rod-like protein with nodules on either end capable of binding GPIIb/IIIa, activated platelets with exposed GPIIb/IIIa can bind fibrinogen to aggregate together. GPIIb/IIIa can also further anchor the platelets to subendothelial vWF for additional clot structural stabilisation.\n\nClassically it was thought that this was the only mechanism involved in aggregation, but  three new mechanisms have been identified which can initiate aggregation, depending on the velocity of blood flow (i.e. shear range). \n\nWound repair\n\nThe blood clot is only a temporary solution to stop bleeding; tissue repair is needed. Small interruptions in the endothelium are handled by physiological mechanisms; large interruptions by the trauma surgeon.\n  The fibrin is slowly dissolved by the fibrinolytic enzyme, plasmin, and the platelets are cleared by phagocytosis. \n\nPlatelet-coagulation factor interactions\n\nIn addition to interacting with vWF and fibrin, platelets interact with thrombin, Factors X, Va, VIIa, XI, IX, and prothrombin to complete clot formation via the coagulation cascade. \nSix studies suggested platelets express tissue factor: the definitive study shows they do not.\n\nRole in non-hematologic diseases\n\nInflammation\n\nIn addition to being the cellular effector of hemostasis, platelets are rapidly deployed to sites of injury or infection, and potentially modulate inflammatory processes by interacting with leukocytes and by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators.    \nPlatelets also secrete platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).\n\nClot formation in non-mammalian vertebrates\n\nInstead of having platelets, non-mammalian vertebrates have thrombocytes, which have a nucleus and resemble B lymphocytes in morphology. They aggregate in response to thrombin, but not to ADP, serotonin, nor adrenaline, as platelets do.  \n\nTests of platelet function\n\nBleeding time \n\nDeveloped by Duke in 1910 and bearing his name, it measured the time for bleeding to stop from a standardized wound in the ear lobe which is blotted each 30 seconds. Normal was less than 3 minutes.  More modern techniques are now used. A normal bleeding time reflects sufficient platelet numbers and function plus normal microvasculature.\n\nMultiplate multiple electrode aggregometry \n\nIn the Multiplate analyzer, anticoagulated whole blood is mixed with saline and a platelet agonist in a single use cuvette with two pairs of electrodes. The increase in impedance between the electrodes as platelets aggregate onto them, is measured and visualized as a curve.\n\nPFA-100 \n\nThe PFA-100 is a system for analysing platelet function in which citrated whole blood is aspirated through  a disposable cartridge containing an aperture within a membrane coated with either collagen and epinephrine or collagen and ADP. These agonists induce platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation leading to rapid occlusion of the aperture and cessation of blood flow termed the closure time (CT).\n\nPlatelet disorders\n\nAdapted from \n\nThe three broad categories of platelet disorders are \"not enough\"; \"dysfunctional\"; and \"too many\".\n\nThrombocytopenia\n\n* Immune thrombocytopenias (ITP) – formerly known as immune thrombocytopenia purpura and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura\n* Splenomegaly\n** Gaucher's disease\n* Familial thrombocytopenia \n* Chemotherapy\n* Babesiosis\n* Dengue\n* Onyalai\n* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\n* HELLP syndrome\n* Hemolytic-uremic syndrome\n* Drug-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (five known drugs – most problematic is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)\n* Pregnancy associated\n* Neonatal alloimmune associated\n* Aplastic anemia\n* Transfusion associated\n* Pseudothrombocytopenia\n* Gilbert's Syndrome \n\nAltered platelet function\n\n* Congenital\n** Disorders of adhesion\n*** Bernard-Soulier syndrome\n** Disorders of activation\n*** Disorders of granule amount or release\n*** Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome\n*** Gray platelet syndrome\n*** ADP Receptor defect\n*** Decreased cyclooxygenase activity\n*** Storage pool defects, acquired or congenital\n** Disorders of aggregation\n*** Glanzmann's thrombasthenia\n*** Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome\n* Acquired\n** Disorders of adhesion\n*** Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\n*** Asthma \n*** Samter's triad (aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease/AERD) \n*** Cancer \n*** Malaria \n*** Decreased cyclooxygenase activity\n\nThrombocytosis and thrombocythemia\n\n* Reactive\n** Chronic infection\n** Chronic inflammation\n** Malignancy\n** Hyposplenism (post-splenectomy)\n** Iron deficiency\n** Acute blood loss \n* Myeloproliferative neoplasms – platelets are both elevated and activated \n** Essential thrombocytosis   \n** Polycythemia vera\n* Associated with other myeloid neoplasms\n* Congenital\n\nDrugs affecting platelets\n\nAnti-inflammatory drugs\n\nSome drugs used to treat inflammation have the unwanted side effect of suppressing normal platelet function. These are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Aspirin irreversibly disrupts platelet function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), and hence normal hemostasis. The resulting platelets are unable to produce new cyclooxygenase because they have no DNA. Normal platelet function will not return until the use of aspirin has ceased and enough of the affected platelets have been replaced by new ones, which can take over a week. Ibuprofen, another NSAID, does not have such a long duration effect, with platelet function usually returning within 24 hours, and taking ibuprofen before aspirin prevents the irreversible effects of aspirin. \n\nDrugs that suppress platelet function\n\nThese drugs are used to prevent thrombus formation.\n\nOral agents\n\n* aspirin\n* clopidogrel\n* cilostazol\n* ticlopidine\n* ticagrelor\n* prasugrel\n\nDrugs that stimulate platelet production\n\n* thrombopoietin mimetics\n* desmopressin\n* factor VIIa\n\nIntravenous agents\n\n* abciximab,\n* eptifibatide\n* tirofiban\n* Others oprelvekin, romiplostim, eltrombopag\n\nTherapy with platelets\n\nTransfusion\n\nIndications\n\nPlatelet transfusion is most frequently used to correct unusually low platelet counts, either to prevent spontaneous bleeding (typically at counts below (10 × 109/L) or in anticipation of medical procedures that will necessarily involve some bleeding. For example, in patients undergoing surgery, a level below 50×109/L is associated with abnormal surgical bleeding, and regional anaesthetic procedures such as epidurals are avoided for levels below 80×109/L.   Platelets may also be transfused when the platelet count is normal but the platelets are dysfunctional, such as when an individual is taking aspirin or clopidogrel.    Finally, platelets may be transfused as part of a massive transfusion protocol, in which the three major blood components (red blood cells, plasma, and platelets) are transfused to address severe hemorrhage.  Platelet transfusion is contraindicated in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), as it fuels the coagulopathy.\n\nCollection\n\nPlatelets are either isolated from collected units of whole blood and pooled to make a therapeutic dose, or collected by platelet apheresis: blood is taken from the donor, passed through a device which removes the platelets, and the remainder is returned to the donor in a closed loop. The industry standard is for platelets to be tested for bacteria before transfusion to avoid septic reactions, which can be fatal. Recently the AABB Industry Standards for Blood Banks and Transfusion Services (5.1.5.1) has allowed for use of pathogen reduction technology as an alternative to bacterial screenings in platelets. \n\nPooled whole-blood platelets, sometimes called “random” platelets, are separated by one of two methods.  In the US, a unit of whole blood is placed into a large centrifuge in what is referred to as a “soft spin.” At these settings, the platelets remain suspended in the plasma. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is removed from the red cells, then centrifuged at a faster setting to harvest the platelets from the plasma. In other regions of the world, the unit of whole blood is centrifuged using settings that cause the platelets to become suspended in the “buffy coat” layer, which includes the platelets and the white blood cells. The “buffy coat” is isolated in a sterile bag, suspended in a small amount of red blood cells and plasma, then centrifuged again to separate the platelets and plasma from the red and white blood cells. Regardless of the initial method of preparation, multiple donations may be combined into one container using a sterile connection device to manufacture a single product with the desired therapeutic dose.\n\nApheresis platelets are collected using a mechanical device that draws blood from the donor and centrifuges the collected blood to separate out the platelets and other components to be collected. The remaining blood is returned to the donor. The advantage to this method is that a single donation provides at least one therapeutic dose, as opposed to the multiple donations for whole-blood platelets. This means that a recipient is not exposed to as many different donors and has less risk of transfusion-transmitted disease and other complications. Sometimes a person such as a cancer patient who requires routine transfusions of platelets will receive repeated donations from a specific donor to further minimize the risk. Pathogen reduction of platelets using for example, riboflavin and UV light treatments can also be carried out to reduce the infectious load of pathogens contained in donated blood products, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of transfusion transmitted diseases.   Another photochemical treatment process utilizing amotosalen and UVA light has been developed for the inactivation of viruses, bacteria, parasites, and leukocytes that can contaminate blood components intended for transfusion.  In addition, apheresis platelets tend to contain fewer contaminating red blood cells because the collection method is more efficient than “soft spin” centrifugation at isolating the desired blood component.\n\nStorage\n\nPlatelets collected by either method have a very short shelf life, typically five days. This results in frequent problems with short supply, as testing the donations often requires up to a full day. Since there are no effective preservative solutions for platelets, they lose potency quickly and are best when fresh.\n\nPlatelets are stored under constant agitation at 20–24 °C (68–75.2 °F). Storage at room temperature provides an environment where any bacteria that are introduced to the blood component during the collection process may proliferate and subsequently cause bacteremia in the patient. Regulations are in place in the United States that require products to be tested for the presence of bacterial contamination before transfusion. \n\nDelivery to recipients\n\nPlatelets do not need to belong to the same A-B-O blood group as the recipient or be cross-matched to ensure immune compatibility between donor and recipient unless they contain a significant amount of red blood cells (RBCs). The presence of RBCs imparts a reddish-orange color to the product, and is usually associated with whole-blood platelets. An effort is sometimes made to issue type specific platelets, but this is not critical as it is with RBCs.\n\nPrior to issuing platelets to the recipient, they may be irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated graft versus host disease or they may be washed to remove the plasma if indicated.\n\nThe change in the recipient's platelet count after transfusion is termed the \"increment\" and is calculated by subtracting the pre-transfusion platelet count from the post-transfusion platelet count.  Many factors affect the increment including the recipient's body size, the number of platelets transfused, and clinical features that may cause premature destruction of the transfused platelets.  When recipients fail to demonstrate an adequate post-transfusion increment, this is termed platelet transfusion refractoriness.\n\nPlatelets, either apheresis-derived or random-donor, can be processed through a volume reduction process. In this process, the platelets are spun in a centrifuge and the excess plasma is removed, leaving 10 to 100 mL of platelet concentrate. Such volume-reduced platelets are normally transfused only to neonatal and pediatric patients, when a large volume of plasma could overload the child's small circulatory system. The lower volume of plasma also reduces the chances of an adverse transfusion reaction to plasma proteins.  Volume reduced platelets have a shelf life of only four hours. \n\nWound therapy\n\nPlatelets release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent chemotactic agent; and TGF beta, which stimulates the deposition of extracellular matrix; fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, platelet-derived epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Local application of these factors in increased concentrations through Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is used as an adjunct in wound healing.",
                "Blood is a body fluid in animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. \n\nIn vertebrates, it is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma. Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume),  and contains dissipated proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves. Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), white blood cells (also called WBCs or leukocytes)  and platelets. The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as bicarbonate ion transported in plasma.\n\nVertebrate blood is bright red when its haemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated. Some animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen, instead of hemoglobin. Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system. In most insects, this \"blood\" does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen.\n\nJawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system, based largely on white blood cells. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are important in the clotting of blood. Arthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system.\n\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled.\n\nMedical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato- (also spelled haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word  (haima) for \"blood\". In terms of anatomy and histology, blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen.\n\nFunctions\n\nBlood performs many important functions within the body including:\n* Supply of oxygen to tissues (bound to hemoglobin, which is carried in red cells)\n* Supply of nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins (e.g., blood lipids))\n* Removal of waste such as carbon dioxide, urea, and lactic acid\n* Immunological functions, including circulation of white blood cells, and detection of foreign material by antibodies\n* Coagulation, the response to a broken blood vessel, the conversion of blood from a liquid to a semi-solid gel to stop bleeding\n* Messenger functions, including the transport of hormones and the signaling of tissue damage\n* Regulation of body pH\n* Regulation of core body temperature\n* Hydraulic functions\n\nConstituents\n\nBlood accounts for 7% of the human body weight,  with an average density of approximately 1060 kg/m3, very close to pure water's density of 1000 kg/m3.  The average adult has a blood volume of roughly 5 L, which is composed of plasma and several kinds of cells. These blood cells (which are also called corpuscles or \"formed elements\") consist of erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs), leukocytes (white blood cells), and thrombocytes (platelets). By volume, the red blood cells constitute about 45% of whole blood, the plasma about 54.3%, and white cells about 0.7%.\n\nWhole blood (plasma and cells) exhibits non-Newtonian fluid dynamics. If all human hemoglobin were free in the plasma rather than being contained in RBCs, the circulatory fluid would be too viscous for the cardiovascular system to function effectively.\n\nFile:Krew Frakcjonowana.jpg|Human blood fractioned by centrifugation. Plasma (upper, yellow layer), buffy coat (middle, thin white layer) and erythrocyte layer (bottom, red layer) can be seen.\nFile:Blutkreislauf.png|Blood circulation:Red oxygenated Blue \n deoxygenated\nFile:Blausen 0425 Formed Elements.png|Illustration depicting formed elements of blood.\nFile:Blut-EDTA.jpg|Two tubes of EDTA-anticoagulated blood. Left tube: after standing, the RBCs have settled at the bottom of the tube. Right tube: contains freshly drawn blood.\n\nCells\n\nOne microliter of blood contains:\n* 4.7 to 6.1 million (male), 4.2 to 5.4 million (female) erythrocytes:  Red blood cells contain the blood's hemoglobin and distribute oxygen. Mature red blood cells lack a nucleus and organelles in mammals. The red blood cells (together with endothelial vessel cells and other cells) are also marked by glycoproteins that define the different blood types. The proportion of blood occupied by red blood cells is referred to as the hematocrit, and is normally about 45%. The combined surface area of all red blood cells of the human body would be roughly 2,000 times as great as the body's exterior surface. \n* 4,000–11,000 leukocytes: White blood cells are part of the body's immune system; they destroy and remove old or aberrant cells and cellular debris, as well as attack infectious agents (pathogens) and foreign substances. The cancer of leukocytes is called leukemia.\n* 200,000–500,000 thrombocytes: Also called platelets, they take part in blood clotting (coagulation). Fibrin from the coagulation cascade creates a mesh over the platelet plug.\n\nPlasma\n\nAbout 55% of blood is blood plasma, a fluid that is the blood's liquid medium, which by itself is straw-yellow in color. The blood plasma volume totals of 2.7–3.0 liters (2.8–3.2 quarts) in an average human. It is essentially an aqueous solution containing 92% water, 8% blood plasma proteins, and trace amounts of other materials. Plasma circulates dissolved nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins), and removes waste products, such as carbon dioxide, urea, and lactic acid.\n\nOther important components include:\n* Serum albumin\n* Blood-clotting factors (to facilitate coagulation)\n* Immunoglobulins (antibodies)\n* lipoprotein particles\n* Various other proteins\n* Various electrolytes (mainly sodium and chloride)\n\nThe term serum refers to plasma from which the clotting proteins have been removed. Most of the proteins remaining are albumin and immunoglobulins.\n\npH values\n\nBlood pH is regulated to stay within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, making it slightly basic.   Blood that has a pH below 7.35 is too acidic, whereas blood pH above 7.45 is too basic. Blood pH, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), and HCO3− are carefully regulated by a number of homeostatic mechanisms, which exert their influence principally through the respiratory system and the urinary system in order to control the acid-base balance and respiration. An arterial blood gas test will measure these. Plasma also circulates hormones transmitting their messages to various tissues. The list of normal reference ranges for various blood electrolytes is extensive.\n\nBlood in non-mammalian vertebrates\n\nHuman blood is typical of that of mammals, although the precise details concerning cell numbers, size, protein structure, and so on, vary somewhat between species. In non-mammalian vertebrates, however, there are some key differences:\n* Red blood cells of non-mammalian vertebrates are flattened and ovoid in form, and retain their cell nuclei\n* There is considerable variation in the types and proportions of white blood cells; for example, acidophils are generally more common than in humans\n* Platelets are unique to mammals; in other vertebrates, small nucleated, spindle cells called thrombocytes are responsible for blood clotting instead\n\nPhysiology\n\nCardiovascular system\n\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In humans, blood is pumped from the strong left ventricle of the heart through arteries to peripheral tissues and returns to the right atrium of the heart through veins. It then enters the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism by cells, to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.\n\nAdditional return flow may be generated by the movement of skeletal muscles, which can compress veins and push blood through the valves in veins toward the right atrium.\n\nThe blood circulation was famously described by William Harvey in 1628. \n\nProduction and degradation of blood cells\n\nIn vertebrates, the various cells of blood are made in the bone marrow in a process called hematopoiesis, which includes erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells; and myelopoiesis, the production of white blood cells and platelets. During childhood, almost every human bone produces red blood cells; as adults, red blood cell production is limited to the larger bones: the bodies of the vertebrae, the breastbone (sternum), the ribcage, the pelvic bones, and the bones of the upper arms and legs. In addition, during childhood, the thymus gland, found in the mediastinum, is an important source of T lymphocytes. \nThe proteinaceous component of blood (including clotting proteins) is produced predominantly by the liver, while hormones are produced by the endocrine glands and the watery fraction is regulated by the hypothalamus and maintained by the kidney.\n\nHealthy erythrocytes have a plasma life of about 120 days before they are degraded by the spleen, and the Kupffer cells in the liver. The liver also clears some proteins, lipids, and amino acids. The kidney actively secretes waste products into the urine.\n\nOxygen transport\n\nAbout 98.5% of the oxygen in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human breathing air at sea-level pressure is chemically combined with the Hgb. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to Hgb. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in mammals and many other species (for exceptions, see below). Hemoglobin has an oxygen binding capacity of between 1.36 and 1.40 ml O2 per gram hemoglobin,  which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventyfold, compared to if oxygen solely were carried by its solubility of 0.03 ml O2 per liter blood per mm Hg partial pressure of oxygen (approximately 100 mm Hg in arteries).\n\nWith the exception of pulmonary and umbilical arteries and their corresponding veins, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and deliver it to the body via arterioles and capillaries, where the oxygen is consumed; afterwards, venules, and veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.\n\nUnder normal conditions in adult humans at rest; hemoglobin in blood leaving the lungs is about 98–99% saturated with oxygen, achieving an oxygen delivery of between 950 and 1150 ml/min[http://www.edwards.com/SiteCollectionImages/edwards/products/presep/ar04313hemodynpocketcard.pdf Edwards Lifesciences LLC - Normal Hemodynamic Parameters – Adult] 2009 to the body. In a healthy adult at rest, oxygen consumption is approximately 200 - 250 ml/min, and deoxygenated blood returning to the lungs is still approximately 75%   (70 to 78%) saturated. Increased oxygen consumption during sustained exercise reduces the oxygen saturation of venous blood, which can reach less than 15% in a trained athlete; although breathing rate and blood flow increase to compensate, oxygen saturation in arterial blood can drop to 95% or less under these conditions.  Oxygen saturation this low is considered dangerous in an individual at rest (for instance, during surgery under anesthesia). Sustained hypoxia (oxygenation of less than 90%), is dangerous to health, and severe hypoxia (saturations of less than 30%) may be rapidly fatal. \n\nA fetus, receiving oxygen via the placenta, is exposed to much lower oxygen pressures (about 21% of the level found in an adult's lungs), and, so, fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity for oxygen (hemoglobin F) in order to function under these conditions. \n\nCarbon dioxide transport\n\nCO2 is carried in blood in three different ways. (The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood). Most of it (about 70%) is converted to bicarbonate ions  by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells by the reaction CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 → H+ + ; about 7% is dissolved in the plasma; and about 23% is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds.  \nHemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the CO2 bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of allosteric effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of CO2 decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. The decreased binding to carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased oxygen levels is known as the Haldane effect, and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. A rise in the partial pressure of CO2 or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the Bohr effect.\n\nTransport of hydrogen ions\n\nSome oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin binds most of the hydrogen ions as it has a much greater affinity for more hydrogen than does oxyhemoglobin.\n\nLymphatic system\n\nIn mammals, blood is in equilibrium with lymph, which is continuously formed in tissues from blood by capillary ultrafiltration. Lymph is collected by a system of small lymphatic vessels and directed to the thoracic duct, which drains into the left subclavian vein where lymph rejoins the systemic blood circulation.\n\nThermoregulation\n\nBlood circulation transports heat throughout the body, and adjustments to this flow are an important part of thermoregulation. Increasing blood flow to the surface (e.g., during warm weather or strenuous exercise) causes warmer skin, resulting in faster heat loss. In contrast, when the external temperature is low, blood flow to the extremities and surface of the skin is reduced and to prevent heat loss and is circulated to the important organs of the body, preferentially.\n\nHydraulic functions\n\nThe restriction of blood flow can also be used in specialized tissues to cause engorgement, resulting in an erection of that tissue; examples are the erectile tissue in the penis and clitoris.\n\nAnother example of a hydraulic function is the jumping spider, in which blood forced into the legs under pressure causes them to straighten for a powerful jump, without the need for bulky muscular legs. \n\nInvertebrates\n\nIn insects, the blood (more properly called hemolymph) is not involved in the transport of oxygen. (Openings called tracheae allow oxygen from the air to diffuse directly to the tissues). Insect blood moves nutrients to the tissues and removes waste products in an open system.\n\nOther invertebrates use respiratory proteins to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity. Hemoglobin is the most common respiratory protein found in nature. Hemocyanin (blue) contains copper and is found in crustaceans and mollusks. It is thought that tunicates (sea squirts) might use vanabins (proteins containing vanadium) for respiratory pigment (bright-green, blue, or orange).\n\nIn many invertebrates, these oxygen-carrying proteins are freely soluble in the blood; in vertebrates they are contained in specialized red blood cells, allowing for a higher concentration of respiratory pigments without increasing viscosity or damaging blood filtering organs like the kidneys.\n\nGiant tube worms have unusual hemoglobins that allow them to live in extraordinary environments. These hemoglobins also carry sulfides normally fatal in other animals.\n\nColor\n\nThe coloring matter of blood (hemochrome) is largely due to the protein in the blood responsible for oxygen transport.  Different groups of organisms use different proteins.\n\nHemoglobin\n\nHemoglobin is the principal determinant of the color of blood in vertebrates. Each molecule has four heme groups, and their interaction with various molecules alters the exact color. In vertebrates and other hemoglobin-using creatures, arterial blood and capillary blood are bright red, as oxygen imparts a strong red color to the heme group. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red; this is present in veins, and can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. This is because the spectrum of light absorbed by hemoglobin differs between the oxygenated and deoxygenated states. \n\nBlood in carbon monoxide poisoning is bright red, because carbon monoxide causes the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. In cyanide poisoning, the body cannot utilize oxygen, so the venous blood remains oxygenated, increasing the redness. There are some conditions affecting the heme groups present in hemoglobin that can make the skin appear blue—a symptom called cyanosis. If the heme is oxidized, methaemoglobin, which is more brownish and cannot transport oxygen, is formed. In the rare condition sulfhemoglobinemia, arterial hemoglobin is partially oxygenated, and appears dark red with a bluish hue.\n\nVeins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons. However, the factors that contribute to this alteration of color perception are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and the processing of visual input by the visual cortex, rather than the actual color of the venous blood. \n\nSkinks in the genus Prasinohaema have green blood due to a buildup of the waste product biliverdin. \n\nHemocyanin\n\nThe blood of most mollusks – including cephalopods and gastropods – as well as some arthropods, such as horseshoe crabs, is blue, as it contains the copper-containing protein hemocyanin at concentrations of about 50 grams per liter. Hemocyanin is colorless when deoxygenated and dark blue when oxygenated. The blood in the circulation of these creatures, which generally live in cold environments with low oxygen tensions, is grey-white to pale yellow, and it turns dark blue when exposed to the oxygen in the air, as seen when they bleed. This is due to change in color of hemocyanin when it is oxidized. Hemocyanin carries oxygen in extracellular fluid, which is in contrast to the intracellular oxygen transport in mammals by hemoglobin in RBCs.\n\nChlorocruorin\n\nThe blood of most annelid worms and some marine polychaetes use chlorocruorin to transport oxygen.  It is green in color in dilute solutions.Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, The Handy Science Answer Book, p. 465, Visible Ink Press, 2011 ISBN 1578593212.\n\nHemerythrin\n\nHemerythrin is used for oxygen transport in the marine invertebrates sipunculids, priapulids, brachiopods, and the annelid worm, magelona.  Hemerythrin is violet-pink when oxygenated.\n\nHemovanadin\n\nThe blood of some species of ascidians and tunicates, also known as sea squirts, contains proteins called vanadins. These proteins are based on vanadium, and give the creatures a concentration of vanadium in their bodies 100 times higher than the surrounding sea water. Unlike hemocyanin and hemoglobin, hemovanadin is not an oxygen carrier. When exposed to oxygen, however, vanadins turn a mustard yellow.\n\nPathology\n\nGeneral medical disorders\n\n* Disorders of volume\n** Injury can cause blood loss through bleeding.  A healthy adult can lose almost 20% of blood volume (1 L) before the first symptom, restlessness, begins, and 40% of volume (2 L) before shock sets in. Thrombocytes are important for blood coagulation and the formation of blood clots, which can stop bleeding. Trauma to the internal organs or bones can cause internal bleeding, which can sometimes be severe.\n** Dehydration can reduce the blood volume by reducing the water content of the blood. This would rarely result in shock (apart from the very severe cases) but may result in orthostatic hypotension and fainting.\n* Disorders of circulation\n** Shock is the ineffective perfusion of tissues, and can be caused by a variety of conditions including blood loss, infection, poor cardiac output.\n** Atherosclerosis reduces the flow of blood through arteries, because atheroma lines arteries and narrows them. Atheroma tends to increase with age, and its progression can be compounded by many causes including smoking, high blood pressure, excess circulating lipids (hyperlipidemia), and diabetes mellitus.\n** Coagulation can form a thrombosis, which can obstruct vessels.\n** Problems with blood composition, the pumping action of the heart, or narrowing of blood vessels can have many consequences including hypoxia (lack of oxygen) of the tissues supplied. The term ischemia refers to tissue that is inadequately perfused with blood, and infarction refers to tissue death (necrosis), which can occur when the blood supply has been blocked (or is very inadequate)\n\nHematological disorders\n\n* Anemia\n** Insufficient red cell mass (anemia) can be the result of bleeding, blood disorders like thalassemia, or nutritional deficiencies; and may require blood transfusion. Several countries have blood banks to fill the demand for transfusable blood. A person receiving a blood transfusion must have a blood type compatible with that of the donor.\n** Sickle-cell anemia\n* Disorders of cell proliferation\n** Leukemia is a group of cancers of the blood-forming tissues and cells.\n** Non-cancerous overproduction of red cells (polycythemia vera) or platelets (essential thrombocytosis) may be premalignant.\n** Myelodysplastic syndromes involve ineffective production of one or more cell lines.\n* Disorders of coagulation\n** Hemophilia is a genetic illness that causes dysfunction in one of the blood's clotting mechanisms. This can allow otherwise inconsequential wounds to be life-threatening, but more commonly results in hemarthrosis, or bleeding into joint spaces, which can be crippling.\n** Ineffective or insufficient platelets can also result in coagulopathy (bleeding disorders).\n** Hypercoagulable state (thrombophilia) results from defects in regulation of platelet or clotting factor function, and can cause thrombosis.\n* Infectious disorders of blood\n** Blood is an important vector of infection. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is transmitted through contact with blood, semen or other body secretions of an infected person. Hepatitis B and C are transmitted primarily through blood contact. Owing to blood-borne infections, bloodstained objects are treated as a biohazard.\n** Bacterial infection of the blood is bacteremia or sepsis. Viral Infection is viremia. Malaria and trypanosomiasis are blood-borne parasitic infections.\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning\n\nSubstances other than oxygen can bind to hemoglobin; in some cases this can cause irreversible damage to the body. Carbon monoxide, for example, is extremely dangerous when carried to the blood via the lungs by inhalation, because carbon monoxide irreversibly binds to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, so that less hemoglobin is free to bind oxygen, and fewer oxygen molecules can be transported throughout the blood. This can cause suffocation insidiously. A fire burning in an enclosed room with poor ventilation presents a very dangerous hazard, since it can create a build-up of carbon monoxide in the air. Some carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin when smoking tobacco.\n\nMedical treatments\n\nBlood products\n\nBlood for transfusion is obtained from human donors by blood donation and stored in a blood bank. There are many different blood types in humans, the ABO blood group system, and the Rhesus blood group system being the most important. Transfusion of blood of an incompatible blood group may cause severe, often fatal, complications, so crossmatching is done to ensure that a compatible blood product is transfused.\n\nOther blood products administered intravenously are platelets, blood plasma, cryoprecipitate, and specific coagulation factor concentrates.\n\nIntravenous administration\n\nMany forms of medication (from antibiotics to chemotherapy) are administered intravenously, as they are not readily or adequately absorbed by the digestive tract.\n\nAfter severe acute blood loss, liquid preparations, generically known as plasma expanders, can be given intravenously, either solutions of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 etc.) at physiological concentrations, or colloidal solutions, such as dextrans, human serum albumin, or fresh frozen plasma. In these emergency situations, a plasma expander is a more effective life-saving procedure than a blood transfusion, because the metabolism of transfused red blood cells does not restart immediately after a transfusion.\n\nBloodletting\n\nIn modern evidence-based medicine, bloodletting is used in management of a few rare diseases, including hemochromatosis and polycythemia. However, bloodletting and leeching were common unvalidated interventions used until the 19th century, as many diseases were incorrectly thought to be due to an excess of blood, according to Hippocratic medicine.\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \"blood\" dates to the oldest English, circa 1000 CE. The word is derived from Middle English, which is derived from the Old English word blôd, which is akin to the Old High German word bluot, meaning blood. The modern German word is (das) Blut.\n\nClassical Greek medicine\n\nFåhræus (a Swedish physician who devised the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) suggested that the Ancient Greek system of humorism, wherein the body was thought to contain four distinct bodily fluids (associated with different temperaments), were based upon the observation of blood clotting in a transparent container. When blood is drawn in a glass container and left undisturbed for about an hour, four different layers can be seen. A dark clot forms at the bottom (the \"black bile\"). Above the clot is a layer of red blood cells (the \"blood\"). Above this is a whitish layer of white blood cells (the \"phlegm\"). The top layer is clear yellow serum (the \"yellow bile\"). \n\nHuman blood\n\nThe ABO blood group system was discovered in the year 1900 by Karl Landsteiner. Jan Janský is credited with the first classification of blood into the four types (A, B, AB, and O) in 1907, which remains in use today. In 1907 the first blood transfusion was performed that used the ABO system to predict compatibility.  The first non-direct transfusion was performed on March 27, 1914. The Rhesus factor was discovered in 1937.\n\nCultural and religious beliefs\n\nDue to its importance to life, blood is associated with a large number of beliefs. One of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol for family relationships through birth/parentage; to be \"related by blood\" is to be related by ancestry or descendance, rather than marriage. This bears closely to bloodlines, and sayings such as \"blood is thicker than water\" and \"bad blood\", as well as \"Blood brother\".\n\nBlood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions, because Leviticus 17:11 says \"the life of a creature is in the blood.\" This phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood or eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off.\n\nMythic references to blood can sometimes be connected to the life-giving nature of blood, seen in such events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death.\n\nIndigenous Australians\n\nIn many indigenous Australian Aboriginal peoples' traditions, ochre (particularly red) and blood, both high in iron content and considered Maban, are applied to the bodies of dancers for ritual. As Lawlor states:\nIn many Aboriginal rituals and ceremonies, red ochre is rubbed all over the naked bodies of the dancers. In secret, sacred male ceremonies, blood extracted from the veins of the participant's arms is exchanged and rubbed on their bodies. Red ochre is used in similar ways in less-secret ceremonies. Blood is also used to fasten the feathers of birds onto people's bodies. Bird feathers contain a protein that is highly magnetically sensitive.  Lawlor comments that blood employed in this fashion is held by these peoples to attune the dancers to the invisible energetic realm of the Dreamtime. Lawlor then connects these invisible energetic realms and magnetic fields, because iron is magnetic.\n\nEuropean paganism\n\nAmong the Germanic tribes, blood was used during their sacrifices; the Blóts. The blood was considered to have the power of its originator, and, after the butchering, the blood was sprinkled on the walls, on the statues of the gods, and on the participants themselves. This act of sprinkling blood was called blóedsian in Old English, and the terminology was borrowed by the Roman Catholic Church becoming to bless and blessing. The Hittite word for blood, ishar was a cognate to words for \"oath\" and \"bond\", see Ishara.\nThe Ancient Greeks believed that the blood of the gods, ichor, was a substance that was poisonous to mortals.\n\nAs a relic of Germanic Law, the cruentation, an ordeal where the corpse of the victim was supposed to start bleeding in the presence of the murderer, was used until the early 17th century.\n\nChristianity\n\nIn Genesis 9:4, God prohibited Noah and his sons from eating blood (see Noahide Law). This command continued to be observed by the Eastern Orthodox.\n\nIt is also found in the Bible that when the Angel of Death came around to the Hebrew house that the first-born child would not die if the angel saw lamb's blood wiped across the doorway.\n\nAt the Council of Jerusalem, the apostles prohibited certain Christians from consuming blood—this is documented in Acts 15:20 and 29. This chapter specifies a reason (especially in verses 19-21): It was to avoid offending Jews who had become Christians, because the Mosaic Law Code prohibited the practice.\n\nChrist's blood is the means for the atonement of sins. Also, ″… the blood of Jesus Christ his [God] Son cleanseth us from all sin.\" (1 John 1:7), “… Unto him [God] that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.\" (Revelation 1:5), and \"And they overcame him (Satan) by the blood\nof the Lamb [Jesus the Christ], and by the word of their testimony …” (Revelation 12:11).\n\nSome Christian churches, including Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Assyrian Church of the East teach that, when consecrated, the Eucharistic wine actually becomes the blood of Jesus for worshippers to drink. Thus in the consecrated wine, Jesus becomes spiritually and physically present. This teaching is rooted in the Last Supper, as written in the four gospels of the Bible, in which Jesus stated to his disciples that the bread that they ate was his body, and the wine was his blood. \"This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.\" ().\n\nMost forms of Protestantism, especially those of a Wesleyan or Presbyterian lineage, teach that the wine is no more than a symbol of the blood of Christ, who is spiritually but not physically present. Lutheran theology teaches that the body and blood is present together \"in, with, and under\" the bread and wine of the Eucharistic feast.\n\nJudaism\n\nIn Judaism, animal blood may not be consumed even in the smallest quantity (Leviticus 3:17 and elsewhere); this is reflected in Jewish dietary laws (Kashrut). Blood is purged from meat by rinsing and soaking in water (to loosen clots), salting and then rinsing with water again several times.  Eggs must also be checked and any blood spots removed before consumption.  Although blood from fish is Biblically kosher, it is rabbinically forbidden to consume fish blood to avoid the appearance of breaking the Biblical prohibition. \n\nAnother ritual involving blood involves the covering of the blood of fowl and game after slaughtering (Leviticus 17:13); the reason given by the Torah is: \"Because the life of the animal is [in] its blood\" (ibid 17:14). In relation to human beings, Kabbalah expounds on this verse that the animal soul of a person is in the blood, and that physical desires stem from it.\n\nLikewise, the mystical reason for salting temple sacrifices and slaughtered meat is to remove the blood of animal-like passions from the person. By removing the animal's blood, the animal energies and life-force contained in the blood are removed, making the meat fit for human consumption. \n\nIslam\n\nConsumption of food containing blood is forbidden by Islamic dietary laws. This is derived from the statement in the Qur'an, sura Al-Ma'ida (5:3): \"Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah.\"\n\nBlood is considered unclean, hence there are specific methods to obtain physical and ritual status of cleanliness once bleeding has occurred. Specific rules and prohibitions apply to menstruation, postnatal bleeding and irregular vaginal bleeding. When an animal has been slaughtered, the animal's  neck is cut in a way to ensure that the spine is not severed, hence the brain may send commands to the heart to pump blood to it for oxygen. In this way, blood is removed from the body, and the meat is generally now safe to cook and eat. In modern times, blood transfusions are generally not considered against the rules.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses\n\nBased on their interpretation of scriptures such as Acts 15:28, 29 (\"Keep abstaining...from blood.\"), Jehovah's Witnesses neither consume blood nor accept transfusions of whole blood or its major components: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (thrombocytes), and plasma. Members may personally decide whether they will accept medical procedures that involve their own blood or substances that are further fractionated from the four major components. \n\nEast Asian culture\n\nIn south East Asian popular culture, it is often said that if a man's nose produces a small flow of blood, he is experiencing sexual desire. This often appears in Chinese-language and Hong Kong films as well as in Japanese and Korean culture parodied in anime, manga, and drama. Characters, mostly males, will often be shown with a nosebleed if they have just seen someone nude or in little clothing, or if they have had an erotic thought or fantasy; this is based on the idea that a male's blood pressure will spike dramatically when aroused. \n\nVampire legends\n\nVampires are mythical creatures that drink blood directly for sustenance, usually with a preference for human blood. Cultures all over the world have myths of this kind; for example the 'Nosferatu' legend, a human who achieves damnation and immortality by drinking the blood of others, originates from Eastern European folklore. Ticks, leeches, female mosquitoes, vampire bats, and an assortment of other natural creatures do consume the blood of other animals, but only bats are associated with vampires. This has no relation to vampire bats, which are new world creatures discovered well after the origins of the European myths.\n\nApplications\n\nIn the applied sciences\n\nBlood residue can help forensic investigators identify weapons, reconstruct a criminal action, and link suspects to the crime. Through bloodstain pattern analysis, forensic information can also be gained from the spatial distribution of bloodstains.\n\nBlood residue analysis is also a technique used in archeology.\n\nIn art\n\nBlood is one of the body fluids that has been used in art.  In particular, the performances of Viennese Actionist Hermann Nitsch, Istvan Kantor, Franko B, Lennie Lee, Ron Athey, Yang Zhichao, Lucas Abela and Kira O' Reilly, along with the photography of Andres Serrano, have incorporated blood as a prominent visual element. Marc Quinn has made sculptures using frozen blood, including a cast of his own head made using his own blood.\n\nIn genealogy and family history\n\nThe term blood is used in genealogical circles to refer to one's ancestry, origins, and ethnic background as in the word bloodline. Other terms where blood is used in a family history sense are blue-blood, royal blood, mixed-blood and blood relative."

                "Blood Function and Composition | myVMC\nBlood Function and Composition\nBlood facts\nApproximately 8% of an adult’s body weight is made up of blood .\nFemales have around 4-5 litres, while males have around 5-6 litres. This difference is mainly due to the differences in body size between men and women.\nIts mean temperature is 38 degrees Celcius.\nIt has a pH of 7.35-7.45, making it slightly basic (less than 7 is considered acidic).\nWhole blood is about 4.5-5.5 times as viscous as water, indicating that it is more resistant to flow than water. This viscosity is vital to the function of blood because if blood flows too easily or with too much resistance, it can strain the heart and lead to severe cardiovascular problems.\nBlood in the arteries is a brighter red than blood in the veins because of the higher levels of oxygen found in the arteries.\nAn artificial substitute for human blood has not been found.\nFunctions of blood\nBlood has three main functions: transport, protection and regulation.\nTransport\nBlood transports the following substances:\nGases, namely oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), between the lungs and rest of the body\nNutrients from the digestive tract and storage sites to the rest of the body\nWaste products to be detoxified or removed by the liver and kidneys\nHormones from the glands in which they are produced to their target cells\nHeat to the skin so as to help regulate body temperature\nProtection\nBlood has several roles in inflammation:\nLeukocytes , or white blood cells, destroy invading microorganisms and cancer cells\nAntibodies and other proteins destroy pathogenic substances\nPlatelet factors initiate blood clotting and help minimise blood loss\nRegulation\npH by interacting with acids and bases\nWater balance by transferring water to and from tissues\nComposition of blood\nBlood is classified as a connective tissue and consists of two main components:\nPlasma , which is a clear extracellular fluid\nFormed elements , which are made up of the blood cells and platelets\nThe formed elements are so named because they are enclosed in a plasma membrane and have a definite structure and shape. All formed elements are cells except for the platelets, which are tiny fragments of bone marrow cells.\nFormed elements are:\nErythrocytes , also known as red blood cells (RBCs)\nLeukocytes, also known as white blood cells (WBCs)\nPlatelets\nInformation on re-publishing of our images\n \nLeukocytes are further classified into two subcategories called granulocytes which consist of neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils; and agranulocytes which consist of lymphocytes and monocytes.\nThe formed elements can be separated from plasma by centrifuge, where a blood sample is spun for a few minutes in a tube to separate its components according to their densities. RBCs are denser than plasma, and so become packed into the bottom of the tube to make up 45% of total volume. This volume is known as the haematocrit . WBCs and platelets form a narrow cream-coloured coat known as the buffy coat immediately above the RBCs. Finally, the plasma makes up the top of the tube, which is a pale yellow colour and contains just under 55% of the total volume.\nBlood plasma\nBlood plasma is a mixture of proteins, enzymes, nutrients, wastes, hormones and gases. The specific composition and function of its components are as follows:\nProteins\nThese are the most abundant substance in plasma by weight and play a part in a variety of roles including clotting, defence and transport. Collectively, they serve several functions:\nThey are an important reserve supply of amino acids for cell nutrition. Cells called macrophages in the liver, gut, spleen, lungs and lymphatic tissue can break down plasma proteins so as to release their amino acids. These amino acids are used by other cells to synthesise new products.\nPlasma proteins also serve as carriers for other molecules. Many types of small molecules bind to specific plasma proteins and are transported from the organs that absorb these proteins to other tissues for utilisation. The proteins also help to keep the blood slightly basic at a stable pH. They do this by functioning as weak bases themselves to bind excess H+ ions. By doing so, they remove excess H+ from the blood which keeps it slightly basic.\nThe plasma proteins interact in specific ways to cause the blood to coagulate, which is part of the body’s response to injury to the blood vessels (also known as vascular injury), and helps protect against the loss of blood and invasion by foreign microorganisms and viruses.\nPlasma proteins govern the distribution of water between the blood and tissue fluid by producing what is known as a colloid osmotic pressure .\nThere are three major categories of plasma proteins, and each individual type of proteins has its own specific properties and functions in addition to their overall collective role:\nAlbumins, which are the smallest and most abundant plasma proteins. Reductions in plasma albumin content can result in a loss of fluid from the blood and a gain of fluid in the interstitial space (space within the tissue), which may occur in nutritional, liver and kidney disease. Albumin also helps many substances dissolve in the plasma by binding to them, hence playing an important role in plasma transport of substances such as drugs, hormones and fatty acids.\nGlobulins, which can be subdivided into three classes from smallest to largest in molecular weight into alpha, beta and gamma globulins. The globulins include high density lipoproteins (HDL), an alpha-1 globulin, and low density lipoproteins (LDL), a beta-1 globulin. HDL functions in lipid transport carrying fats to cells for use in energy metabolism, membrane reconstruction and hormone function. HDLs also appear to prevent cholesterol from invading and settling in the walls of arteries. LDL carries cholesterol and fats to tissues for use in manufacturing steroid hormones and building cell membranes, but it also favours the deposition of cholesterol in arterial walls and thus appears to play a role in disease of the blood vessels and heart. HDL and LDL therefore play important parts in the regulation of cholesterol and hence have a large impact on cardiovascular disease.\nFibrinogen, which is a soluble precursor of a sticky protein called fibrin, which forms the framework of blood clot. Fibrin plays a key role in coagulation of blood, which is discussed later in this article under Platelets.\nAmino acids\nThese are formed from the break down of tissue proteins or from the digestion of digested proteins.\nNitrogenous waste\nBeing toxic end products of the break down of substances in the body, these are usually cleared from the bloodstream and are excreted by the kidneys at a rate that balances their production.\nNutrients\nThose absorbed by the digestive tract are transported in the blood plasma. These include glucose, amino acids, fats, cholesterol, phospholipids, vitamins and minerals.\nGases\nSome oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported by plasma. Plasma also contains a substantial amount of dissolved nitrogen.\nElectrolytes\nThe most abundant of these are sodium ions, which account for more of the blood’s osmolarity than any other solute.\nRed blood cells\nRed blood cells (RBCs), also known as erythrocytes, have two main functions:\nTo pick up oxygen from the lungs and deliver it to tissues elsewhere\nTo pick up carbon dioxide from other tissues and unload it in the lungs\nAn erythrocyte is a disc-shaped cell with a thick rim and a thin sunken centre. The plasma membrane of a mature RBC has glycoproteins and glycolipids that determine a person’s blood type. On its inner surface are two proteins called spectrin and actin that give the membrane resilience and durability. This allows the RBCs to stretch, bend and fold as they squeeze through small blood vessels, and to spring back to their original shape as they pass through larger vessels.\nRBCs are incapable of aerobic respiration, preventing them from consuming the oxygen they transport because they lose nearly all their inner cellular components during maturation. The inner cellular components lost include their mitochondria, which normally provide energy to a cell, and their nucleus, which contains the genetic material of the cell and enable it to repair itself. The lack of a nucleus means that RBCs are unable to repair themselves. However, the resulting biconcave shape is that the cell has a greater ratio of surface area to volume, enabling O2 and CO2 to diffuse quickly to and from Hb.\nThe cytoplasm of a RBC consists mainly of a 33% solution of haemoglobin (Hb), which gives RBCs their red colour. Haemoglobin carries most of the oxygen and some of the carbon dioxide transported by the blood.\nCirculating erythrocytes live for about 120 days. As a RBC ages, its membrane grows increasingly fragile. Without key organelles such as a nucleus or ribosomes, RBCs cannot repair themselves. Many RBCs die in the spleen, where they become trapped in narrow channels, broken up and destroyed. Haemolysis refers to the rupture of RBCs, where haemoglobin is released leaving empty plasma membranes which are easily digested by cells known as macrophages in the liver and spleen. The Hb is then further broken down into its different components and either recycled in the body for further use or disposed of.\n \nWhite blood cells\nWhite blood cells (WBCs) are also known as leukocytes. They can be divided into granulocytes and agranulocytes. The former have cytoplasms that contain organelles that appear as coloured granules through light microscopy, hence their name. Granulocytes consist of neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. In contrast, agranulocytes do not contain granules. They consist of lymphocytes and monocytes.\nGranulocytes\nNeutrophils: These contain very fine cytoplasmic granules that can be seen under a light microscope. Neutrophils are also called polymorphonuclear (PMN) because they have a variety of nuclear shapes. They play roles in the destruction of bacteria and the release of chemicals that kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria.\nEosinophils: These have large granules and a prominent nucleus that is divided into two lobes. They function in the destruction of allergens and inflammatory chemicals, and release enzymes that disable parasites.\nBasophils: They have a pale nucleus that is usually hidden by granules. They secrete histamine which increases tissue blood flow via dilating the blood vessels, and also secrete heparin which is an anticoagulant that promotes mobility of other WBCs by preventing clotting.\nAgranulocytes\nLymphocytes: These are usually classified as small, medium or large. Medium and large lymphocytes are generally seen mainly in fibrous connective tissue and only occasionally in the circulation bloodstream. Lymphocytes function in destroying cancer cells, cells infected by viruses, and foreign invading cells. In addition, they present antigens to activate other cells of the immune system. They also coordinate the actions of other immune cells, secrete antibodies and serve in immune memory.\nMonocytes: They are the largest of the formed elements. Their cytoplasm tends to be abundant and relatively clear. They function in differentiating into macrophages, which are large phagocytic cells, and digest pathogens, dead neutrophils, and the debris of dead cells. Like lymphocytes, they also present antigens to activate other immune cells.\nPlatelets\nPlatelets are small fragments of bone marrow cells and are therefore not really classified as cells themselves.\nPlatelets have the following functions:\nSecrete vasoconstrictors which constrict blood vessels, causing vascular spasms in broken blood vessels\nForm temporary platelet plugs to stop bleeding\nSecrete procoagulants (clotting factors) to promote blood clotting\nDissolve blood clots when they are no longer needed\nDigest and destroy bacteria\nSecrete chemicals that attract neutrophils and monocytes to sites of inflammation\nSecrete growth factors to maintain the linings of blood vessels\nThe first three functions listed above refer to important haemostatic mechanisms in which platelets play a role in during bleeding: vascular spasms, platelet plug formation and blood clotting (coagulation).\nVascular spasm\nThis is a prompt constriction of the broken blood vessel and is the most immediate protection against blood loss. Injury stimulates pain receptors. Some of these receptors directly innervate nearby blood vessels and cause them to constrict. After a few minutes, other mechanisms take over. Injury to the smooth muscle of the blood vessel itself causes a longer-lasting vasoconstriction where platelets release a chemical vasoconstrictor called serotonin. This maintains vascular spasm long enough for the other haemostatic mechanisms to come into play.\nPlatelet plug formation\nUnder normal conditions, platelets do not usually adhere to the wall of undamaged blood vessels, since the vessel lining tends to be smooth and coated with a platelet repellent. When a vessel is broken, platelets put out long spiny extensions to adhere to the vessel wall as well as to other platelets. These extensions then contract and draw the walls of the vessel together. The mass of platelets formed is known as a platelet plug, and can reduce or stop minor bleeding.\nCoagulation\nThis is the last and most effective defence against bleeding. During bleeding, it is important for the blood to clot quickly to minimise blood loss, but it is equally important for blood not to clot in undamaged vessels. Coagulation is a very complex process aimed at clotting the blood at appropriate amounts. The objective of coagulation is to convert plasma protein fibrinogen into fibrin, which is a sticky protein that adheres to the walls of a vessel. Blood cells and platelets become stuck to fibrin, and the resulting mass helps to seal the break in the blood vessel. The forming of fibrin is what makes coagulation so complicated, as it involved numerous chemicals reactions and many coagulation factors.\nProduction of blood\nHaemopoiesis\nHaemopoiesis is the production of the formed elements of blood. Haemopoietic tissues refer to the tissues that produce blood. The earliest haemopoietic tissue to develop is the yolk sac, which also functions in the transfer of yolk nutrients of the embryo. In the foetus, blood cells are produced by the bone marrow, liver, spleen and thymus. This changes during and after birth. The liver stops producing blood cells around the time of birth, while the spleen stops producing them soon after birth but continues to produce lymphocytes for life. From infancy onwards, all formed elements are produced in the red bone marrow. Lymphocytes are additionally produced in lymphoid tissues and organs widely distributed in the body, including the thymus, tonsils, lymph nodes, spleen and patches of lymphoid tissues in the intestine.\nErythropoesis\nErythropoiesis refers specifically to the production of erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBCs). These are formed through the following sequence of cell transformations:\nInformation on re-publishing of our images\nThe proerythroblast has receptors for the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). Once EPO receptors are in place, the cell is committed to exclusively producing RBCs. The erythroblasts then multiply and synthesise haemoglobin (Hb), which is a red oxygen transport protein. The nucleus from the erythroblasts is then discarded, giving rise to cells named reticulocytes. The overall transformation from haemocytoblast to reticulocytes involves a reduction in cell size, an increase in cell number, the synthesis of haemoglobin, and the loss of the cell nucleus. These reticulocytes leave the bone marrow and enter the bloodstream where they mature into erythrocytes when their endoplasmic reticulum disappears.\nLeukopoiesis\nLeukopoiesis refers to the production of leukocytes (WBCs). It begins when some types of haemocytoblasts differentiate into three types of committed cells:\nB progenitors, which are destined to become B lymphocytes\nT progenitors, which become T lymphocytes\nGranulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, which become granulocytes and monocytes\nThese cells have receptors for colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). Each CSF stimulates a different WBC type to develop in response to specific needs. Mature lymphocytes and macrophages secrete several types of CSFs in response to infections and other immune challenges. The red bone marrow stores granulocytes and monocytes until they are needed in the bloodstream. However, circulating leukocytes do not stay in the blood for very long. Granulocytes circulate for 4-8 hours and then migrate into the tissues where they live for another 4-5 days. Monocytes travel in the blood for 10-20 hours, then migrate into the tissues and transform into a variety of macrophages which can live as long as a few years. Lymphocytes are responsible for long-tern immunity and can survive from a few weeks to decades. They are continually recycled from blood to tissue fluid to lymph and finally back to the blood.\nThrombopoiesis\nThrombopoiesis refers to the production of platelets in the blood, because platelets used to be called thrombocytes. This starts when a haemocytoblast develops receptors for the hormone thrombopoietin which is produced by the liver and kidneys. When these receptors are in place, the haemocytoblast becomes a committed cell called a megakaryoblast. This replicates its DNA, producing a large cell called a megakaryocyte, which breaks up into tiny fragments that enter the bloodstream. About 25-40% of the platelets are stored in the spleen and released as needed. The remainder circulate freely in the blood are live for about 10 days.\nAgeing changes in the blood\nThe properties of blood change as we grow older. It is thought that these changes might contribute to the increased incident of clot formation and atherosclerosis in older people. Some of the most prominent findings on these changes include:\nRise in fibrinogen\nIncreased red blood cell rigidity\nIncreased formation of fibrin degradation products\nEarlier activation of the coagulation system\nThe increased level of plasma fibrinogen is thought to be due to either its rapid production or slower degradation. As age progresses, fibrinogen and plasma viscosity tend to be positively correlated, with the rise in plasma viscosity being largely attributed to the rise in fibrinogen.\nThe viscosity of blood depends on factors such as shear rate, haemocrit, red cell deformability, plasma viscosity and red cell aggregation. Although there are many factors involved, hyperviscosity syndrome can be generated by a rise in only one factor. A state of hyperviscosity causes sluggish blood flow and reduced oxygen supply to the tissue.\nAn age-dependent increase in various coagulation factors, a positive correlation with fibrinogen and a negative correlation with plasma albumin has also been found. Both platelet and red cell aggregation increase with age, with red cell aggregation appearing to be the primary factor responsible for a rise in blood viscosity at low shear rates.\nThe decrease in red cell deformability (increase in rigidity) refers to its ability to deform under flow forces. Less deformable cells offer more resistance to flow in the microcirculation, which influences the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Studies have found that older people have less fluid membranes in their red cells.\nBlood H+ has also been found to be positively correlated with age, making the blood slightly more acidic as we age. This results in a swelling of the cell, making the red cells less deformable. This sets up a cycle for further increase in blood viscosity and worsening of blood flow parameters.\nSince ageing causes a reduction in total body water, blood volume decreases due to less fluid being present in the bloodstream. The number of red blood cells, and the corresponding haemoglobin and haemocrit levels, are reduced which contributes to fatigue in the individual. Most of the white blood cells stay at their original levels, although there is a decrease in lymphocyte number and ability to fight off bacteria, leading to a reduced ability to resist infection.\nOverall, the rise in fibrinogen is the most common and significant change in blood during ageing because it contributes to a rise in plasma viscosity, red blood cell aggregation and a rise in blood viscosity at low shear rates. Increased age is associated with a state of hypercoagulation of blood, making older people more susceptible to clot formation and atherosclerosis.",

A person with a disorder related to blood clotting--whether he's unusually susceptible to strokes caused by clots forming in his vessels or is unable to properly coagulate when injured--is likely to be able to trace the disorder to an abnormal platelet count.\nPieces of Bone Marrow\nPlatelets are the smallest type of blood cell--smaller than either red or white cells. Along with plasma, these three types of cells comprise the blood in your veins. Platelets are fractured pieces of very large bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes, which means they're not technically full cells but broken, irregularly shaped fragments of cells. One of the symptoms of a bone marrow disorder is a dangerous drop in platelet count.\nBlood Loss Prevention\nWhen blood vessels are damaged and blood loss begins, the very small and light platelets are the first cells to reach the ruptured surface of the vessel. The platelets, in combination with nutrients like vitamin K and a protein called fibrinogen, form a thick, tough web of material called fibrin. A cluster of fibrin threads covers the hole in the blood vessel and prevents blood from escaping while repairs are done. You've seen lots of fibrin-clusters before--they're scabs.\nUnintended Effects\nThough hemostasis--the prevention of blood loss--is the official function of platelets, they can cause serious medical problems if not properly balanced. A body with an abnormally high platelet count can sometimes develop blood clots--buildups of fibrin within the blood vessels that obstruct proper flow. Likewise, a body with too few platelets may be unable to clot its blood properly, giving cuts that would otherwise be minor a risk of serious blood loss.",

                "Transporters in human platelets: physiologic function and impact for pharmacotherapy | Blood Journal\nTransporters in human platelets: physiologic function and impact for pharmacotherapy\nGabriele Jedlitschky, Andreas Greinacher and Heyo K. Kroemer\nBlood 2012 119:3394-3402; doi: https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2011-09-336933\nGabriele Jedlitschky\nPDF\nAbstract\nPlatelets store signaling molecules (eg, serotonin and ADP) within their granules. Transporters mediate accumulation of these molecules in platelet granules and, on platelet activation, their translocation across the plasma membrane. The balance between transporter-mediated uptake and elimination of signaling molecules and drugs in platelets determines their intracellular concentrations and effects. Several members of the 2 major transporter families, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and solute carriers (SLCs), have been identified in platelets. An example of an ABC transporter is MRP4 (ABCC4), which facilitates ADP accumulation in dense granules. MRP4 is a versatile transporter, and various additional functions have been proposed, notably lipid mediator release and a role in aspirin resistance. Several other ABC proteins have been detected in platelets with functions in glutathione and lipid homeostasis. The serotonin transporter (SERT, SLC6A4) in the platelet plasma membrane represents a well-characterized example of the SLC family. Moreover, recent experiments indicate expression of OATP2B1 (SLCO2B1), a high affinity transporter for certain statins, in platelets. Changes in transporter localization and expression can affect platelet function and drug sensitivity. This review summarizes available data on the physiologic and pharmacologic role of transporters in platelets.\nIntroduction\nPlatelets are derived from megakaryocytes. Despite being anucleate, they fulfill a multitude of functions. Platelets are not only key players in hemostasis and in vascular disease, they also contribute to inflammation, tumor angiogenesis, embryonic development, and immunologic responses. 1 , 2 Platelets contain many biologically active molecules, such as factors triggering platelet aggregation, growth factors, and many other compounds, which are secreted on platelet activation. This function is highly dependent on their intracellular compartmentalization.\nPlatelets contain at least 3 types of intracellular granules, in which mediators are stored and concentrated, known as α, dense, and lysosomal granules. 3 The α-granules mainly contain proteins critical to adhesion, such as von Willebrand factor, thrombospondin, and fibrinogen, as well as growth factors and protease inhibitors, clotting factors, and immunoglobulin G. Lysosomes hold a battery of hydrolytic enzymes, which are postulated to function in the elimination of circulating platelet aggregates and potentially also in host defense. Dense granules, such as lysosomes, are acidic organelles but, unlike the aforementioned organelles, contain extremely high concentrations of small molecules, especially ADP, ATP, serotonin, and calcium. 3 Dense granule molecules participate in hemostasis in numerous ways, as ADP activates nearby platelets and serotonin causes vasoconstriction.\nThe biosynthesis of platelet-dense and α-granules is thought to occur in megakaryocytes through a common multivesicular intermediate body. 4 However, the presence of plasma membrane proteins, such as GPIb, in the granule membranes suggests that these arise from both endogenous synthesis within the megakaryocyte as well as from fusion with endocytic vesicles during budding from the plasma membrane. 5\nPlatelet-dense granules are absent (or greatly reduced), and/or their contents are significantly reduced in a heterogeneous group of congenital platelets defects called δ-storage pool deficiencies (δ-SPD). 6 These are associated with a moderate bleeding tendency. The most severe δ-SPD is Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding, and lysosomal ceroid storage result from defects of melanosomes, platelet-dense granules, and lysosomes. 7 , 8 Mutations in a variety of genes have been identified as causes for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, for example, in genes known to function in vesicle trafficking and in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles. 9\nThe accumulation of compounds, such as ADP, in high concentrations inside the dense granules points to their active transport. The identification of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein ABCC4, better known as multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), as a candidate transporter for adenine nucleotides in platelet-dense granules, 10 represents a first step toward the elucidation of this important function of platelets. MRP4 is a markedly versatile transporter exhibiting a broad substrate specificity composed of a wide range of amphiphilic anions, including steroid conjugates and eicosanoids, as well as cyclic nucleotides and nucleotide analogues. 11 , 12 Accordingly, several other tasks have been proposed for MRP4 in platelets taking into account that its localization can be shifted from granules to the plasma membrane on activation of the platelets and under certain pathophysiologic conditions. 10 , 13 , 14 These include the release of lipid mediators 15 , 16 as well as a role in aspirin resistance under certain conditions as in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 14\nDetailed experiments address the transport of serotonin in platelets, especially its transport across the plasma membrane. Serotonin, which is released into circulation mainly from the enterochromaffin cells in the gut, is rapidly taken up by platelets and stored in platelet-dense granules, which constitute almost all total body circulating serotonin. 17 Platelets have been used as models of neuronal transport of serotonin and also of several amino acid transmitters for many years. 18 , 19 Furthermore, studies of the secretion mechanisms in platelets have indicated major similarities to neuronal transmitter release despite the fact that these cells have different origins. 20 Neurons also contain small dense core vesicles that contain small molecules, such as serotonin taken up and concentrated from intracellular or extracellular pools, which resemble in many features platelet-dense granules.\nAn important emerging concept is that platelets may function as “long-haul truckers” not only for endogenous biologically active substances, such as serotonin, but also for a variety of drugs. Although platelets are small in size (only 2.0-5.0 μm in diameter), 3 they represent a relatively large compartment for drugs considering their high numbers (normal range, 150-450 × 109 cells/L blood). In adults (5 L blood), the whole body platelet volume, including one-third splenic sequestration, accounts to approximately 20 mL (10 fL/platelet). This potential function of platelets is not well characterized, although it seems to be of major importance. All systemic drugs reach their targets via the bloodstream and come into contact with platelets; thereby, they can either be concentrated and stored within or be excluded from platelets, depending on the presence of uptake and export transporters in the platelet plasma membrane. In some cases, platelets also house the target structures, as the cyclo-oxygenase (COX)–1 enzyme, 14 which is inhibited by aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, 21 which represents the target of statins. As a result of transporter-mediated uptake, drugs can act on the target structures inside the platelets and provoke therapeutically positive effects or negative side effects. On the other hand, elimination of drugs from the platelet by export pumps can limit the effect of the drug and lead to drug resistance. Thus, because of their various functions, platelet transporters can either serve as drug targets or as drug delivery systems, and these functions can be greatly altered in the setting of thrombocytopenia or with inherited or acquired platelet defects.\nThe purpose of this review is to examine the state of the art in knowledge about transporters important in platelet function as well as in pharmacotherapy.\nTaxonomy of transporters\nTwo major protein superfamilies are involved in the transport of drugs as well as endogenous metabolites and signaling molecules: the ABC proteins with approximately 50 genes in humans grouped in 7 subfamilies, 22 , 23 and the more than 300 solute carriers (SLCs) divided in 55 subfamilies. 24 , 25 Members of both families have been identified in platelets ( Table 1 ). In general, mammalian ABC transporters represent export pumps that bind and hydrolyse ATP, providing the energy for a unidirectional transport of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds across membranes from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space or into cellular organelles, often against a concentration gradient. 22 , 23 The typical structure of a functional (“full-size”) mammalian ABC transporter contains at least 2 clusters of usually 6 membrane-spanning segments as well as 2 nucleotide-binding domains ( Figure 1 A). 22 , 23 In contrast, many SLC proteins function either by facilitating passive diffusion along the concentration gradient of the substrate (independently of energy input) or by cotransport and countertransport co-opting the concentration gradient of another solute. The structures of SLCs are often characterized by a cluster of 10 to 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning segments ( Figure 1 B). 24 , 25\nView this table:\nDownload powerpoint\nFigure 1\nTypical membrane topologies predicted for ABC and SLC transporters. (A) Structure of MRP4 (ABCC4) consisting of 2 clusters of 6 membrane-spanning segments and 2 regions containing nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). (B) Structure of the serotonin uptake transport (SERT, SLC6A2) exhibiting a cluster of 12 membrane-spanning segments.\nThe most prominent representative of the ABC proteins is ABCB1, better known as P-glycoprotein, which was originally identified by virtue of its ability to confer resistance to a range of structurally unrelated cytotoxic drugs in cancer cells (multidrug resistance). P-glycoprotein is expressed mainly in tissues with barrier function as in the gut or the blood-brain barrier, 22 but not in platelets. Some features of P-glycoprotein, however, are shared by several members of the C-branch of the ABC family, the so-called MRPs. 11 Members of this subfamily, such as MRP4, which is abundantly expressed in platelets, transport mainly amphiphilic anions, including many drugs or drug conjugates but also a number of endogenous signaling molecules, including arachidonate- and purine nucleotide-derived mediators. 11 Other ABC transporters, especially of the A-branch, play an important role in the lipid homeostasis of cells, including platelets. 26\nThe superfamily of SLCs is composed of differed types of carriers for a huge spectrum of substrates, including nutrients, such as inorganic ions, sugars, amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins, as well as drugs. Subfamilies of SLC for which members have been characterized within platelets include: the oligospecific Na+- and Cl−-dependent monoamine neurotransmitter transporters (SLC6-family), with the serotonin transporter (SERT, SLC6A4) as a prominent member expressed in platelets; the vesicular amine transporter family (SLC18); the nucleoside-sugar transporter family (SLC35); as well as the multispecific organic anion transporting peptide family (SLC21/SLCO; Table 1 ). Members of the latter family have been recognized to play an important role in the distribution of certain drugs as statins. A member of this family, OATP2B1 (SLCO2B1), has also been characterized in platelets. 21 Another SLC protein, the choline transporter-like protein 2 (CTL-2, SLC44A2) recently gained major attention in hematology when it was identified to carry the human neutrophil antigen (HNA)3a, one of the major antigens involved in transfusion-associated lung injury. 27 This protein is also expressed in platelets. 28\nABC transporters in platelets\nRole of MRP4 (ABCC4) in platelets\nThe high concentration of ADP inside the platelet-dense granules (up to 0.6M) suggests the involvement of a primary active transport protein. A candidate protein mediating this active transport was found in MRP4. Besides its localization in the plasma membrane, MRP4 was demonstrated to be highly expressed in the membrane of dense granules ( Figure 2 A). 10 , 13 , 14 Accordingly, an altered distribution of MRP4 was observed in platelets from a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in which MRP4 was only detected in the plasma membrane because of the lack of dense granules. 10 This intracellular localization distinguishes the MRP4 expression in platelets from that in other cell types, where it is localized mainly at the plasma membrane. It is conceivable that different splice variants of MRP4 are expressed in different tissues because at least 2 transcript variants of the human ABCC4/MRP4 gene exist that are predicted to encode proteins with distinct N-terminal extensions (reference sequences NM_005845.3 variant 1 and NM_001105515.1 shorter variant 2). Analysis of the MRP4 mRNA in platelets and mass spectrometry analysis of the protein, 29 however, indicate that the platelet 190-kDa MRP4 glycoprotein corresponds to the long variant 1 expressed also in other tissues. 30 , 31\nDownload powerpoint\nFigure 2\nProposed functions of MRP4 in mediator storage and drug resistance depending on its localization. (A) Role of MRP4 in mediator storage and release in normal resting and activated platelets. In resting platelets, MRP4 is mainly present in the membrane of dense granules 10 , 13 , 14 and mediates sequestration of mediators and possibly other compounds into these organelles (left panel); in activated platelets, MRP4 among other granule membrane proteins is inserted into the plasma membrane on granule exocytosis and may then contribute to the release of a variety of compounds, including de novo generated lipid mediators (right panel). (B) Proposed role of MRP4 in aspirin resistance. As suggested by Mattiello et al, 14 aspirin effect on platelets is little related to MRP4-mediated aspirin transport in normal platelets, although MRP4 may sequestrate a part of the drug into dense granules (left panel). In patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, however, MRP4 is up-regulated on the plasma membrane already in resting platelets and mediates active extrusion of aspirin from the cells resulting in an insufficient intracellular COX-1 inhibition by this drug 14 , 33 (right panel).\nThe hypothesis that MRP4 is involved in the ADP storage in platelets is further supported by studies in patients with partial δ-SPDs, whose platelets are only deficient in ADP and not in serotonin. 13 Based on the assumption that MRP4 is essential for the adenine nucleotide storage, one would expect that defects of MRP4 expression and localization are associated with decreased levels of adenine nucleotides in platelet-dense granules, but normal levels of other constituents, such as serotonin for which other transporters are involved. Two patients were identified who exhibited this rare phenotype of partial δ-SPD characterized by decreased platelet ADP content but normal serotonin levels. The MRP4 expression in the platelets of these patients was severely diminished. 13 The underlying molecular defect leading to the diminished MRP4 expression in these platelets, however, has so far not been identified. A similar phenotype with selective adenine nucleotide deficiency was already previously observed in a dog model. 32 Analyses of the MRP4 expression in platelets of patients with the more prevalent classic δ-SPD type, characterized by low adenine nucleotide and serotonin levels, revealed a different pattern. In these patients, MRP4 was found to be expressed in a quantitatively normal fashion, but its localization was significantly changed compared with normal platelets. In these patients, MRP4 seemed to be expressed only at the plasma membrane. 13\nInterestingly, such a shift in the intracellular localization of MRP4 seems to occur also under other pathologic conditions. Recently, Mattiello et al reported that, compared with platelets from healthy volunteers, platelets from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery exhibit increased amounts of MRP4, which was localized preferentially at the plasma membrane. 14 In these patients, suboptimal platelet inhibition by aspirin (so-called aspirin resistance) is particularly common, and Mattiello et al hypothesized that the up-regulated MRP4 increases active extrusion of aspirin from platelet cytosol, resulting in less effective COX-1 inhibition 14 , 33 ( Figure 2 B). This assumption is based on the following observations: aspirin reduced uptake of Fluo-cAMP, a potential MRP4 substrate, into dense granules of normal platelets and is released after thrombin activation of platelets, indicating that aspirin itself is accumulated in dense granules. Platelets from coronary artery bypass graft patients showed a high expression of MRP4 whose in vitro inhibition by dipyridamole or MK-571 enhanced aspirin entrapment and increased its effect on COX-1. Platelets derived from megakaryocytes transfected with MRP4 siRNA exhibited higher aspirin entrapment. 14 Further studies are required to elucidate the role of MRP4 in aspirin transport and in the interindividual variations of platelet inhibition by aspirin that are also often observed in patients with acute coronary syndrome or diabetes. 33 , 34\nWhen platelets are activated, granule integral membrane proteins become inserted into the plasma membrane on granule exocytosis. 3 Thus, activated platelets exhibit an additional cohort of plasma membrane MRP4, which may alter platelet function by increased transport of various substrates. When inserted into the plasma membrane, MRP4 may also contribute to the export of a variety of lipid mediators, such as thromboxane A2 and leukotrienes ( Figure 2 A). In contrast to ADP and serotonin, these lipid mediators are supposed to be generated de novo on platelet activation. Because they exert their effects mainly extracellularly via interaction with membrane receptors, an efficient release from the cells is also required for these mediators.\nIt was first recognized for the 5-lipoxygenase product leukotriene C4 (LTC4) that its biosynthesis in leukocytes is followed by a distinct active export. 35 , 36 MRP1 (ABCC1) was the first high-affinity transporter identified for LTC4, 37 and its important role in LTC4 release from mast cells was confirmed in studies in Mrp1 knockout mice. 38 ATP-dependent transport of this cysteinyl leukotriene was subsequently shown to be mediated also by other MRPs, including MRP3 (ABCC3) 39 and MRP4. 15 Although platelets lack 5-lipoxygenase activity, they contain LTC4 synthase 40 and can produce LTC4 when supplied with LTA4 via transcellular mechanisms, and 3 LTC4 transporters, MRP1, MRP3, and MRP4, are expressed in platelets, which makes it likely that platelets play an important role in LTC4 homeostasis.\nPrimary prostaglandins (PGs) such as PGE2 and thromboxane A2, have been formerly assumed to diffuse passively from the cell, despite being poorly membrane permeable. Reid et al 30 and Rius et al 41 demonstrated, however, that prostaglandins, including thromboxane B2, are actively transported by MRP4 and that this transport is inhibited by a number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and indomethacin. 30\nAnother immune-modulating lipid mediator released by platelets on thrombin stimulation is sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P). Platelet-derived S-1-P modulates the chemotaxis of monocytes and is involved in inflammatory processes. 42 The release of S-1-P was found to depend on platelet thromboxane formation and activation of the thromboxane receptor. 16 The actual release process probably also involves a member of the MRP family. 16 It was suggested that MRP1 mediates S-1-P export in mast cells. 43 Secretion of S-1-P from human platelets was blocked by MK571, 16 a cysteinyl leukotriene analog, which was originally identified as a specific inhibitor for MRP1 37 but interferes also with MRP4. 10 , 15 S-1-P excretion by platelets was also inhibited by dipyridamole and indomethacin, 16 which are known to inhibit preferentially MRP4. 10 , 30 This suggests that the release of S-1-P from platelets also involves members of the MRP family, preferentially MRP4.\nInserted in the plasma membrane, MRP4 may also extrude cyclic nucleotides, such as cAMP and cGMP, 10 ⇓ – 12 , 44 which are both critical inhibitory intracellular second messengers regulating fundamental processes in platelets. 45 The cellular levels of these mediators are controlled by the action of phosphodiesterases, which have been also suggested as targets in antiplatelet treatment, 46 as well as by active secretion into the extracellular space, which may provide also extracellular purine-based mediators for paracrine functions.\nFrom a therapeutic perspective, there are thus several aspects regarding MRP4 that provide reasons for its targeting in use of MRP4 inhibitors for antiplatelet therapy. MRP4 transport is inhibited by dipyridamole, which, however, has other effects, such as inhibition of phosphodiesterases. 46 More specific (but as yet undeveloped) compounds would be a very interesting option to interfere selectively with platelet ADP storage and possibly also release of lipid mediators.\nIn addition to physiologic and pathophysiologic regulation, genetic variations may account for variable MRP4 function. The ABCC4/MRP4 gene is highly polymorphic with at least 25 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms; however, the influence of these on MRP4 expression and function in vivo remains to be established. 31 Interestingly, the ABCC4/MRP4 gene was one of the 68 genomic loci, which were identified as putative regulators of platelet formation in a recently published meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for platelet count and volume. 47\nMrp4(−/−) mice have been generated and characterized mainly with respect to their susceptibility toward nucleoside analogues. 48 They exhibit no obvious bleeding tendency; however, extrapolating these observations to humans is problematic because of interspecies differences in the properties of the transporter and in the overall hemostatic process and compensatory mechanisms.\nMRP1 (ABCC1) and MRP3 (ABCC3)\nReports on the expression of MRP1 in platelets had been controversial. 15 , 49 The presence of MRP1 in platelet membranes could be proven by use of 2D-nanoLC-MS/MS, 29 but in a significantly lower amount compared with MRP4. Both MRP1 and MRP4 are able to contribute to the transport of LTC4 as well as to platelet glutathione homeostasis because both MRPs mediate cotransport of a variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds with reduced glutathione. 11 , 15 , 50 MRP1 exports in addition oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfate). 51 Another candidate transporter for LTC4 that is present in platelet membranes is MRP3, which also transports cysteinyl leukotrienes, although with a lower affinity as observed with MRP1. 39 Interestingly, the expression of MRP3 and MRP4 increases during differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells toward megakaryocytes, suggesting that the expression of these proteins may be particularly important for platelet function. 29 MRP1 and MRP3 are also known to confer resistance to a number of cytotoxic agents, such as etoposide. 11 Thus, they may also play a role in resistance of platelets against toxins and can determine the action of several amphiphilic drugs on platelet function.\nABCA and ABCB transporters\nTranscripts of several members of the ABCA family, such as ABCA3, ABCA4, ABCA6, ABCA7, and ABCA9, have been detected in human platelets. 29 ABCA7 was shown to be preferentially expressed in platelets and localized at the plasma membrane of rat and human platelets. 29 , 52 ABCA proteins are typically associated with lipid translocation processes in membranes. Two types of intramembrane lipid translocators can be defined: flippases, which translocate lipids from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet of the membrane; and floppases, which mediate the reverse process (ie, translocation from the inner to the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer). 53 Such membrane remodeling processes also play an important role in platelet function, especially during secondary hemostasis. The flopping of phosphatidylserine from the inner to outer membrane leaflet during platelet activation, together with microparticle shedding, provides a catalytic surface for the assembly of coagulation complexes. 54 , 55 There is a rare platelet defect, the Scott syndrome, 56 which underscores the importance of this pathway. In these patients, although primary hemostatic function of platelets is intact, the platelets do not support the assembly of coagulation complexes because of defective scrambling of membrane phospholipids. 56 In addition, there exists an inverse condition, the Stormorken syndrome, in which platelets constitutively expose phosphatidylserine on the external leaflet of their plasma membrane. 57\nTwo protein classes are thought to be involved in membrane remodeling: a nonspecific and energy-independent family of so-called scramblases 58 and ABC transporters, especially of the A- and B-branch. ABCA1, which is involved in cholesterol efflux from cells and in phagocytosis, and which is mutated in Tangier dyslipidemia (absence of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol from plasma), 59 , 60 has been considered also to play a role in Scott syndrome. This hypothesis is based on the observation that targeted deletion of the corresponding gene locus resulted in a phenotype evocative of partial Scott syndrome, 61 and a mis-sense mutation in the ABCA1 gene was identified in a Scott syndrome patient. 62 However, the expression of ABCA1 in platelets has not been established so far.\nABCA7, which has been identified in platelets, however, shares several features with ABCA1. ABCA7 also mediates the formation of high-density lipoprotein when exogenously transfected and expressed and was also reported to relate to the phagocytotic function of cells. 63 Genetic variants of the ABCA7 gene have been found to be associated with Alzheimer disease. 64 ABCB4, also known as MDR2/3 (Mdr2 in rodents, MDR3 in humans), represents another floppase identified in the platelet plasma membrane. 29 This finding is surprising because the expression and function of MDR3 were thought to be limited to the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. 65 Here, MDR3 “flops” phosphatidylcholine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane, thereby making this phospholipid available for extraction into the canalicular lumen by bile salts. 66 Mutations in the ABCB4/MDR3 gene cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. 66 However, so far none of the ABCA and ABCB transporters has been explicitly confirmed as a floppase for PS. The interaction of platelet microparticles with the endothelium and leukocytes in addition triggers inflammation. Thus, the lipid translocators in platelets may have an important role in thrombosis and in inflammation.\nBesides their role in plasma membrane remodeling, MDR3 and ABCA proteins may be involved in the release of lipid mediators as lysophosphatidic acid and S1-P from platelets. Lysophosphatidic acid is a bioactive lipid that binds to cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors to regulate cell growth, differentiation, and development. 67 In the cardiovascular system, lysophosphatidic acid alters the endothelial barrier function and is a weak platelet agonist. 68 , 69 In addition, it was proposed that members of the ABCA subfamily are involved in the transport of S-1-P, 52 especially ABCA7. Furthermore, ABCAs and MDR3 may function in the defense of platelets against highly lipophilic compounds.\nSLC transporters in platelets\nSerotonin transporters\nSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) is best known for its role as neurotransmitter involved in mood disorders. 18 However, serotonin is also stored in platelets and, when released, promotes platelet aggregation via the serotonin receptor (5-HT2A) on platelets. 17 Moreover, it exhibits strong vasoactive properties, possibly through stimulation of serotonin receptors on endothelial cells and through nitric oxide production. 70 Recently, it was also shown that serotonin strongly induces extracellular matrix synthesis in interstitial fibroblasts and promotes tissue fibrosis. 71\nSerotonin storage in platelets results from a 2-step process: (1) the uptake across the platelet plasma membrane; and (2) the transport across the dense granule membrane. The uptake of serotonin into the platelet cytosol is mediated by SERT (also called 5-HTT). The cDNA of human SERT has been cloned, and the gene (SLC6A4) has been assigned to the human chromosome 17. 72 , 73 Expression of SERT was characterized in different tissues, including brain and platelets. Thereby, the transport protein appears identical in brain and platelets. 74 SERT belongs to the SLC6 gene family of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter proteins. 75 The actual uptake process involves the binding of serotonin to its recognition site within the transporter and its transport across the membrane together with an Na+ ion. A second step involves the translocation of a K+ ion across the membrane to the outside of the cell. This requirement for K+ countertransport is unique for SERT within the SLC6 family. 76 Because both tricyclic antidepressants and the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) bind to SERT and inhibit serotonin uptake, the importance of understanding the biochemical characteristics of this transporter has long been appreciated. 18 SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin into neurons as well as the uptake into platelets; thus, platelets were used as model for monitoring the effect of antidepressants. 77 , 78\nIn addition, platelets exhibit uptake mechanisms for several amino acid transmitters, among them γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, aspartate, and glycine, and characteristics of the platelet uptake functions resemble those of the uptake in the central nervous system, 19 qualifying platelets as a favored model system in neurology ( Figure 3 ).\nDownload powerpoint\nFigure 4\nPlatelet transporters and their proposed functions at a glance. Platelets express a variety of SLC and ABC transporters, which are located in the plasma membrane as well as in the membranes of intracellular compartments,such as the dense (δ) and α (α) granules, and in other intracellular membrane systems, such as the dense tubular system (DTS; for details and references, see Table 1 ). They play a vital role in the uptake, sequestration, and release of mediators involved in platelet function. With respect to pharmacotherapy, the platelet represents a pharmacokinetic microcompartment, in which the interplay between uptake and elimination transporters determines intracellular drug concentrations.\nTransporters are also potential new targets for pharmacologic inhibition of platelet function. Inhibiting a transporter instead of a receptor provides attractive options. On the one hand, the effects are long lasting and relatively robust even in patients with moderate compliance; and on the other hand, the drug effect can be counteracted immediately by transfusion of platelet concentrates, as the transfused platelets contain the substrates of the respective transporter. From a more pharmacologic point of view, platelets represent pharmacokinetic micro-compartments, in which the combination of uptake and elimination transport, possibly together with intracellular metabolism, determines pharmacokinetics of drugs. Transporters can be specifically used to direct antiplatelet drugs to target structures inside the platelets. Probably more important, many non-antiplatelet drugs may interfere with the physiologic substrates of these transporters in platelets and may in this way affect platelet function and modulate their hemostatic capacity. A better understanding of these mechanisms may help to recognize potential prothrombotic or prohemorrhagic effects of drugs. Finally, platelets may influence pharmacotherapy of possibly many drugs and accordingly contribute to interindividual variation in drug response. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the expression, function, and regulation of transporters in platelets will add to a better understanding of platelet biology and in many ways may result in improved therapeutic options.\nAuthorship\nContribution: G.J. wrote the paper and designed the figures; and A.G. and H.K.K. edited the manuscript and provided conceptual insights.\nConflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial interests.\nCorrespondence: Gabriele Jedlitschky, Institut für Pharmakologie, Center of Drug Absorption and Transport, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität Greifswald, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; e-mail: jedlits{at}uni-greifswald.de; and Andreas Greinacher, Institut für Immunologie und Transfusionsmedizin, Ernst Moritz-Arndt-Universität Greifswald, 17487 Greifswald, Germany; e-mail: greinach{at}uni-greifswald.de.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Theodore Warkentin (Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON) for expert proofreading of the manuscript.\nThis work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Germany (grants JE234/4-1 and SFB/TR19), and by the GANI-MED project (the Greifswald Approach to Individualized Medicine), funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany; and by the Center for Immune Reactions in Cardiovascular Disease, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany.\nSubmitted September 21, 2011.\n© 2012 by The American Society of Hematology\nReferences",
                "Platelets\nPlatelets\nIn this section we introduce platelets themselves.\nPlatelets are the smallest of the three major types of blood cells.\nPlatelets are only about 20% of the diameter of red blood cells.  The normal platelet count is 150,000-350,000 per microliter of blood, but since platelets are so small, they make up just a tiny fraction of the blood volume.  The principal function of platelets is to prevent bleeding. \nRed blood cells are the most numerous blood cell, about 5,000,000 per microliter.  Red blood cells make up about 40% of our total blood volume, a measure called the hematocrit.  Their color is caused by hemoglobin, which accounts for nearly all of the red cell volume.  Hemoglobin is the critical protein that transports oxygen from our lungs to the tissues.  Red cells are normally shaped as round, biconcave discs.  With microscopic examination, they look like a red or orange tire with a thin, almost transparent center.\nWhite blood cells are the largest of the blood cells but also the fewest.  There are only 5,000 to 10,000 white blood cells per microliter.  There are several different types of white cells but all are related to immunity and fighting infection. \nPlatelet Production\nPlatelets are produced in the bone marrow, the same as the red cells and most of the white blood cells.  Platelets are produced from very large bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes.  As megakaryocytes develop into giant cells, they undergo a process of fragmentation that results in the release of over 1,000 platelets per megakaryocyte.  The dominant hormone controlling megakaryocyte development is thrombopoietin (often abbreviated as TPO). \n \nPlatelet Structure\nPlatelets are actually not true cells but merely circulating fragments of cells.  But even though platelets are merely cell fragments, they contain many structures that are critical to stop bleeding.  They contain proteins on their surface that allow them to stick to breaks in the blood vessel wall and also to stick to each other.  They contain granules that can secrete other proteins required for creating a firm plug to seal blood vessel breaks.  Also platelets contain proteins similar to muscle proteins that allow them to change shape when they become sticky. \n \nThe pictures above show normal platelets on the left.  They are shaped like a plate, therefore their name.  When platelets are stimulated by a break in the blood vessel wall they change shape as shown in the other three pictures.  They become round and extend long filaments.  They may even look like an octopus, with long tentacles reaching out to make contact with the broken blood vessel wall or with other platelets.  With these long filaments, platelets then form a plug to seal the broken blood vessel. \n \nPlatelet Function\nIn addition to being the smallest blood cell, platelets are also the lightest.  Therefore they are pushed out from the center of flowing blood to the wall of the blood vessel.  There they roll along the surface of the vessel wall, which is lined by cells called endothelium.  The endothelium is a very special surface, like Teflon, that prevents anything from sticking to it.  However when there is an injury or cut, and the endothelial layer is broken, the tough fibers that surround a blood vessel are exposed to the liquid flowing blood.  It is the platelets that react first to injury.  The tough fibers surrounding the vessel wall, like an envelop, attract platelets like a magnet, stimulate the shape change that is shown in the pictures above, and platelets then clump onto these fibers, providing the initial seal to prevent bleeding, the leak of red blood cells and plasma through the vessel injury.\n \n         \nThe color photograph is a microscopic picture of a drop of blood spread out onto a glass slide.  The magnification is not as high as the pictures above, so the platelets seem very small.  It can be seen that as the platelets touch the glass, they begin to stick together forming a long string.  This illustrates the basic function of platelets, to stick to any foreign surface and then to stick together.  The red blood cells in this picture are normal, with their round shape and their thin center. \n \nDisorders of Platelet Function\nThe most common disorder of platelet function is caused by aspirin.  Aspirin blocks one of the steps required for platelets to stick together.  This effect of aspirin is what makes it an effective treatment for patients who have disorders of blood clotting or thrombosis.  For example, a person coming to an emergency room with severe chest pain and a suspected heart attack is immediately given aspirin.  This prevents some of the platelet clumping which can obstruct the blood flow to the heart.  Aspirin is an effective medicine to prevent these clots, but it does not totally paralyze the platelet.  Therefore many people take daily aspirin and have no problems with bleeding.  However aspirin can be potentially dangerous in patients who already have a risk for bleeding, such as boys with hemophilia or patients who have too few platelets and depend on each platelet having full function.\n \nDisorders of Platelets Number:  Too Many Platelets\nRare conditions result in the bone marrow producing too many platelets, sometimes as many as one million or two million per microliter.  In some of these patients, there are increased risks for blood clots, but many patients with these disorders have no problems. \n \nDisorders of Platelet Number:  Too Few Platelets\nDisorders with low platelet counts are called thrombocytopenias, a term derived from an old name for platelets, “thrombocytes”.  This name describes the platelets as the cells (“cytes” is a word for cell) that contribute to thrombosis, or blood clotting.  The last part of the word, “-penia”, refers to too few cells.\n \nThrombocytopenia is the principal focus of this website.  Thrombocytopenia can be caused by failure of the bone marrow to produce normal numbers of platelets.  Bone marrow failure has multiple causes.  These are not discussed on this website. \nThrombocytopenia can also be caused by increased destruction of platelets once they are produced and released into the circulating blood.  These disorders are the focus of this website.  They are described briefly here and in more detail in their specific sections on this website.\nImmune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)  - This disorder, described in its own section on this website, is caused both by increased platelet destruction and also decreased bone marrow platelet production.  These problems are caused by autoantibodies.  Antibodies are proteins normally made by a type of white blood cells to react with and defend against foreign materials.  For example, antibodies are normally formed to bacteria and viruses, and help with the healing process.  Antibodies are normally stimulated by immunization and vaccination, to prevent infections.  Antibodies normally react with organ transplants and attempt to reject these transplants.  Autoantibodies are abnormal.  These occur when antibody-producing cells receive mixed signals, and identify a normal body tissue as foreign and try to reject it.  The term, autoantibody, means an antibody that reacts with the person herself, not foreign material.  In ITP, platelets are recognized by the immune system as “foreign” cells and autoantibodies are made against platelets.  The autoantibodies destroy the platelets rapidly after they are produced.  The autoantibodies also react with the bone marrow megakaryocytes and inhibit platelet production. \nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia (DITP)  - This disorder is described in its own section on this website. Almost all medications can cause bad allergic reactions in sensitive people, but these reactions are rare.  Most commonly, drugs may cause a red rash in sensitive people.  Drugs can also cause serious reactions with blood platelets.  In these reactions, drugs stick to the platelet surface, and this combination of the drug bound to the platelet can be recognized by the body as a foreign substance and the body then makes an antibody to the drug-coated platelets, and all platelets can be destroyed.  When the drug is stopped, platelet destruction is stopped, and the platelet count returns to normal.  But these drug-dependent antibodies can persist for many years, the same way that protective antibodies persist for many years after immunizations.  So if the patient takes the drug again, the platelets are coated, the antibody reacts with the platelets and again the platelet count falls immediately to low levels.  Therefore recognition of a drug as the cause for thrombocytopenia is critical to avoid any further exposure to that drug.\nLow platelet       counts that occur during pregnancy        - This is sometimes called “Gestational thrombocytopenia”. This is       described in its own section on this website. It is not a “disorder”. The       cause is not known, but the consistent observation is that a few women       with uncomplicated pregnancies, perhaps 5%, may have a low platelet       count.  The platelet count is not       very low.  Commonly it is only       100,000-150,000/µL, or just below the lower limit of normal.  Our opinion is that this is merely a       normal adjustment of the platelet count during pregnancy, that the       platelet counts of pregnant women, particularly near the end of pregnancy       and at the time of delivery, all shift down a little bit.  A reason for this is that the plasma       volume is increased during pregnancy, and therefore the platelets are       simply diluted in the larger volume of plasma.  This is the explanation for why the       blood hemoglobin concentration is also a little lower during       pregnancy.  Our opinion is that this       is not a health problem and it does not require any additional testing or       care.\nThrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) - These  disorders are the result of abnormal blood clotting in the smallest blood vessels  (arterioles, capillaries) throughout all of the body.  There are multiple causes of these  syndromes.  All are uncommon.  The most important of these syndromes,       thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic  uremic syndrome, drug-induced TMA, and complement-mediated TMA, are  described in their own sections on this website.\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) - In this disorder, described in its own section in this website, platelets are consumed in tiny clots in small blood vessels throughout the body.  The cause of TTP       is a  deficiency of a blood enzyme that helps to prevent platelet clumping and the  resulting formation of the tiny blood clots. The enzyme is known by its  initials, ADAMTS13.  A minor deficiency  of ADAMTS13 can occur in many different illnesses and appears to be harmless. A  severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 can predispose a person to the development of  TTP.  A severe deficiency of ADAMTS13  doesn’t itself actually cause TTP because patients can have a complete  deficiency and have no health problems for many years.  But then, when another condition occurs that increases  the risk of blood clotting, such as an infection, surgery, or pregnancy, TTP  can become a sudden and severe illness.  ADAMTS13 deficiency can be inherited because  of a gene mutation, causing lifetime deficiency. Much more commonly ADAMTS13  deficiency can be acquired as a result of an autoantibody.\nDrug-induced TMA (DITMA)- Just like DITP, drugs can cause TMA by the formation of drug dependent antibodies.       Quinine is the most common cause of DITMA  related to drug-dependent antibodies.   Quinine-induced TMA is typically a very sudden and severe illness with  severe kidney injury.  DITMA can also be  caused by direct drug toxicity.  This may also be sudden and severe, as with  an illegal drug is used.  An example of  this is the intravenous injection of the narcotic, Opana (oxymorphone).  Other examples of toxic DITMA are from cancer  drugs and immunosuppressive drugs used for patients with an organ transplant.\nHemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This is a       TMA syndrome caused by an intestinal infection with a bacteria that       secretes a very potent toxin, named Shiga toxin.  In the US and Europe, the most common       bacteria causing these infections are certain types of E. coli, and the       most common type of E. coli is called E. coli O157:H7.  E. coli O157:H7 is a common and normal       intestinal bacteria in cattle.        Therefore eating undercooked beef or contact with cattle can create       a risk for HUS.  Most cases of HUS       are sporadic, just a single person is infected.  Sometimes a large dramatic outbreak can       occur, related to a restaurant or a contaminated food or water       source.  Shiga toxin can cause       severe kidney injury.\nComplement-mediated TMA.  This is a recently recognized cause,       usually associated with an inherited gene mutation that causes an       abnormality of the immune (complement) system.  The complement proteins are normal blood       proteins that can act as scavengers so our bodies can remove our own damaged       cells or destroy foreign cells. If the complement system becomes       overactive because of an inherited gene mutation that limits the normal       regulation and control, the complement system can damage our own       cells.  This is what happens in       complement-mediated TMA.  The most vulnerable target seems to be the kidneys and the most serious problems       are kidney injury and failure.  In       2011 a new anti-complement drug was approved specifically for this TMA. Its       generic name is eculizumab; its trade name is Soliris.  It is extremely expensive – the price is       over $600,000 per year of treatment.        However it is effective when used for the proper patients.\n \nIMPORTANT!\nThe information included in this website is for educational purposes only.

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe number of platelets in your blood can be affected by many diseases. Platelets may be counted to monitor or diagnose diseases, or to look for the cause of too much bleeding or clotting.\nNormal Results\nThe normal number of platelets in the blood is 150,000 to 400,000 platelets per microliter (mcL) or 150 to 400 x10^9/L.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly. Some lab use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your doctor about your test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nLOW PLATELET COUNT\nA low platelet count is below 150,000. If you do not have enough platelets, you may bleed too much.\nIf your platelet count is below 50,000, your risk of bleeding is much higher. Even every day activities can cause bleeding. If your platelets are low, you need to know how to prevent bleeding and what to do if you are bleeding.\nA lower-than-normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia . Low platelet count can be divided into 3 main causes:\nNot enough platelets are being made in the bone marrow\nPlatelets are being destroyed in the bloodstream\nPlatelets are being destroyed in the spleen or liver\n3 of the more common causes of this problem are:",

A main characteristic of cardiovascular disease is impaired blood flow and formation of blood clots. Platelets are clot-forming cells responsible for the prevention of bleeding. However, in disease conditions they may be overly activated, promoting blood clots and blockage of blood vessels.\nConsumption of diets rich in fruits and vegetables decreases mortality from cardiovascular disease through a number of mechanisms, including the prevention of platelet clotting and aggregation. There is some evidence suggesting that platelet aggregation may be modulated through a group of compounds known as flavan-3-ols, which are found in various foods, and especially in cocoa. However, the mechanisms by which those compounds affect platelet function are not yet fully understood. We designed a human study assessing the mechanisms by which flavan-3-ols from cocoa beneficially affect platelet function and the platelet proteome.\nPrimary Purpose: Prevention\nOfficial Title:\nAcute Effects of the Consumption of Dark Chocolate Enriched in Flavan-3-ols on Platelet Function and the Platelet Proteome\nFurther study details as provided by University of Aberdeen:\nPrimary Outcome Measures:\nChange in light transmission aggregometry of platelet-rich plasma [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing a Helena Platelet Aggregation Chromogenic Kinetics System-4 (PACKS-4) light transmission aggregometer\nInduced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP)\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\nChange in ex vivo bleeding time using the Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100) [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing collagen-epinephrine coated cartridges.\nChange in P-selectin expression and activation of the fibrinogen receptor by flow cytometry [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nP-selectin expression as early marker for platelet activation\nActivated fibrinogen receptor as late marker for platelet activation\nInduced by ADP and TRAP\nUsing BD FACSArray Bioanalyzer\nLevels of flavan-3-ols and their metabolites in plasma and urine [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)\nEnzyme-hydrolysed for total flavan-3-ols ((-)-epicatechin equivalents)\nNon-Hydrolysed for metabolic profile\nChanges in the platelet proteome [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, 2 hours after chocolate ingestion ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing 2D-gel electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS identification of proteins.\nChanges in thromboxane A2 production induced by ADP and TRAP [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in plasma after platelet aggregation\nLevels of prostacyclin and/ or leukotrienes in plasma [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and/ or immunoassays\nTotal phenolics in urine [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing the Folin-Ciocalteu assay\nTotal catechins in urine [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing an adaption of the DMACA assay\nUrinary creatinine [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing a Thermo KONELAB 30 selective chemistry analyser (Thermo Scientific, Hertfordshire, UK) and its respective kit\nTo be used for normalisation of urinary flavan-3-ols and total phenolics from spot urine samples.\nAnalysis of flavan-3-ol and procyanidin contents in study chocolates [ Time Frame: At the beginning (April 2009) and end (October 2009) of the intervention period ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing an HPLC method\nNon-targeted 1H-NMR of plasma and urine samples [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nTo establish a metabolic profile - markers of intake and potential effects on host metabolism\nNon-targeted LC-MS of urine samples [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, just before and 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nTo establish a metabolic profile - markers of intake and potential effects on host metabolism\nMarkers of oxidative stress in plasma [ Time Frame: Post-prandial, up to 6 hours after chocolate consumption ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nPlasma levels of lipid peroxides (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, TBARS)\nActivity of glutathione peroxidase (Only at t = 2 h after chocolate ingestion)\nFatty acid analysis of study chocolates [ Time Frame: Shortly after the intervention period was finished (February 2009) ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]\nUsing the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis and a gas chromatographic approach\nEnrollment:",
                "What are Platelets and Why They are Important: Johns Hopkins Women’s Cardiovascular Health Center\nWhat are Platelets and Why are They Important?\nDr. Marlene Williams, CICU Director for Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center\nMarlene Williams, M.D.  currently applies her clinical and research expertise to platelet function and genotyping in acute coronary syndrome.\nThe purpose of platelets\n“Platelets are the cells that circulate within our blood and bind together when they recognize damaged blood vessels,” says Dr. Marlene Williams, Assistant Professor of Medicine and CICU Director for Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. “When you get a cut, for example, the platelets bind to the site of the damaged vessel, thereby causing a blood clot. There’s an evolutionary reason why they’re there. It’s to stop us from bleeding.”\nWhat makes platelets change their shape?\nPlatelets, the smallest of our blood cells, can only be seen under a microscope. They’re literally shaped like small plates in their non-active form. A blood vessel will send out a signal when it becomes damaged. When platelets receive that signal, they’ll respond by traveling to the area and transforming into their “active” formation. To make contact with the broken blood vessel, platelets grow long tentacles and then resemble a spider or an octopus.\nWhat is a healthy platelet count?\nA normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Having more than 450,000 platelets is a condition called thrombocytosis; having less than 150,000 is known as thrombocytopenia. You get your platelet number from a routine blood test called a complete blood count (CBC).\nWhat it means to have too many platelets (thrombocytosis)\nThe medical term for having too many platelets is thrombocytosis, and there are two types:\nPrimary or essential thrombocytosis – Abnormal cells in the bone marrow cause an increase in platelets, but the reason is unknown\nSecondary thrombocytosis – The same condition as primary thrombocytosis, but may be caused by an ongoing condition or disease such as anemia, cancer, inflammation, or infection\nWhen there are symptoms, they include spontaneous blood clots in the arms and legs, which if untreated can lead to heart attack and stroke. In severe cases, the patient might have to undergo a procedure called a platelet pheresis. This lowers the platelet count by removing the blood, separating out the platelets, and returning the red blood cells back to the body.\nWith secondary thrombocytosis, the symptoms are usually related to the associated condition. For example, if you have an infection or anemia, you treat those conditions and the platelet count comes down.\nWhat it means to have too few platelets (thrombocytopenia)\nWhen you don’t have enough platelets, it’s called thrombocytopenia. Symptoms include easy bruising, and frequent bleeding from the gums, nose, or GI tract. Your platelet count drops when something is preventing your body from producing platelets. There are a wide range of causes, including:\nMedications\nCertain types of cancer, such as leukemia or lymphoma\nChemotherapy treatment for cancer\nToo much alcohol\nHow platelets relate to cardiovascular disease\nIf you have too many platelets, it can increase your risk for clotting. But often your cardiovascular risk has more to do with platelet function than platelet number. For example, you could have a healthy number of platelets, but if they’re sticking together too much it can increase your chance of having a heart attack or stroke.\nKeeping track of your platelets\nToo many platelets, too few platelets, abnormally functioning platelets, and related conditions such as blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks can be inherited. So it’s a good idea to alert your doctor when there’s a family connection.\n“Although you may feel fine, your physician might want to keep a close eye on you and investigate whether or not you need medications to reduce the functioning of your platelets,” says Dr. Williams. “The most common blood-thinning medication is aspirin, although recent studies have shown that women under 65 who are otherwise healthy do not receive the same benefit from aspirin as men do. There is no concrete answer to that yet.”\nMore information"
