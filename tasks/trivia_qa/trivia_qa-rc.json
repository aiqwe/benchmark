                "William Shakespeare (;  26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.; ; . He is often called England's national poet, and the \"Bard of Avon\".  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. \n\nShakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, and religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. \n\nShakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.  His early plays were primarily comedies and histories, and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.\n\nMany of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, however, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as \"not of an age, but for all time\".The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century, Volume B, 2012, pg. 1168 \n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular, and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.\n\nLife\n\nEarly life\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.  He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day.  This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers, because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616.  He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son. \n\nAlthough no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford,  a free school chartered in 1553,  about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree,  and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors. \n\nAt the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.  The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste, since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times,  and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583.  Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585.  Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596. \n\nAfter the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the \"complaints bill\" of a law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589.  Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's \"lost years\".  Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him.  Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London.  John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster.  Some 20th-century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain \"William Shakeshafte\" in his will.  Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area. \n\nLondon and theatrical career\n\nIt is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.  By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit:\n\n... there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country. \n\nScholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words,; . but most agree that Greene is accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe and Greene himself (the so-called \"university wits\").  The italicised phrase parodying the line \"Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide\" from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3, along with the pun \"Shake-scene\", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here, Johannes Factotum (\"Jack of all trades\") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common \"universal genius\". \n\nGreene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s, to just before Greene's remarks.  After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London.  After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King's Men. \n\nIn 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man,  and in 1597 he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford. \n\nSome of Shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages.  Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603).  The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.  The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of \"the Principal Actors in all these Plays\", some of which were first staged after Volpone, although we cannot know for certain which roles he played.  In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that \"good Will\" played \"kingly\" roles.  In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father.  Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It, and the Chorus in Henry V,  though scholars doubt the sources of that information. \n\nThroughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames.  He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.  By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of ladies' wigs and other headgear. \n\nLater years and death\n\nRowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford \"some years before his death\".. He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men \"placed men players\" there, \"which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.\". However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609. The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610),  which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.  Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614. In 1612, he was called as a witness in Bellott v. Mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary.  In March 1613 he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory;  and from November 1614 he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall.  After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.  His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher,  who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men. \n\nShakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52.  He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in \"perfect health\". No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: \"Shakespeare, Drayton and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted\",   not an impossible scenario, since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: \"We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon/From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room.\" \n\nHe was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607,  and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death. \nShakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family. \n\nShakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna  under stipulations that she pass it down intact to \"the first son of her body\".  The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying.  The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line.  Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one third of his estate automatically.  He did make a point, however, of leaving her \"my second best bed\", a bequest that has led to much speculation.  Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance. \n\nShakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death.  The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008: \n\nGood frend for Iesvs sake forbeare,\nTo digg the dvst encloased heare.\nBleste be  man  spares thes stones,\nAnd cvrst be he  moves my bones. \n\n(Modern spelling: Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, / To dig the dust enclosed here. / Blessed be the man that spares these stones, / And cursed be he that moves my bones.)\n\nSometime before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor, Socrates, and Virgil.  In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio, the Droeshout engraving was published. \n\nShakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.  \n\nPlays\n\nMost playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career.  Some attributions, such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays, remain controversial, while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well-attested contemporary documentation. Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised by other writers after their original composition.\n\nThe first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date, however,  and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period.  His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland,  dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty.  The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca.  The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story.  Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape,  the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors. \n\nShakespeare's early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies.  A Midsummer Night's Dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.  Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic Merchant of Venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences.  The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing,  the charming rural setting of As You Like It, and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare's sequence of great comedies.  After the lyrical Richard II, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and Henry V. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.  This period begins and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death;  and Julius Caesar—based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's Parallel Lives—which introduced a new kind of drama.  According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in Julius Caesar \"the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other\". \n\nIn the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called \"problem plays\" Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and All's Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies.  Many critics believe that Shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art. The titular hero of one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies, Hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \"To be or not to be; that is the question\".  Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, Othello and King Lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement.  The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.  In Othello, the villain Iago stokes Othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him.  In King Lear, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, \"the play-offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty\".  In Macbeth, the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare's tragedies,  uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne, until their own guilt destroys them in turn.  In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus, contain some of Shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot. \n\nIn his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, as well as the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.  Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day.  Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher. \n\nPerformances\n\nIt is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.  After the plagues of 1592–3, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames.  Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV, Leonard Digges recording, \"Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room\".  When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark.  The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with Julius Caesar one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including Hamlet, Othello and King Lear. \n\nAfter the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy, the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605, including two performances of The Merchant of Venice.  After 1608, they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer.  The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In Cymbeline, for example, Jupiter descends \"in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees.\" \n\nThe actors in Shakespeare's company included the famous Richard Burbage, William Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including Richard III, Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear.  The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing, among other characters.  He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear.  In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII \"was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony\". On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision.\n\nTextual sources\n\nIn 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays. It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time.  Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.  No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as \"stol'n and surreptitious copies\".  Nor did Shakespeare plan or expect his works to survive in any form at all; those works likely would have faded into oblivion but for his friends' spontaneous idea, after his death, to create and publish the First Folio. \n\nAlfred Pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as \"bad quartos\" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.  Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers.  In some cases, for example Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida and Othello, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion. \n\nPoems\n\nIn 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on erotic themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin.  Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses,  the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.  Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.  The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission. \n\nSonnets\n\nPublished in 1609, the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership.  Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's \"sugred Sonnets among his private friends\".  Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence.  He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the \"dark lady\"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the \"fair youth\"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial \"I\" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets \"Shakespeare unlocked his heart\". \n\nThe 1609 edition was dedicated to a \"Mr. W.H.\", credited as \"the only begetter\" of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication.  Critics praise the Sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time. \n\nStyle\n\nShakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.  The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted. \n\nSoon, however, Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.  No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.  By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.\n\nShakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.  Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:.\n\nAfter Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as \"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\".  In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.  In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: \"was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?\" (1.7.35–38); \"... pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air ...\" (1.7.21–25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense. The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity. \n\nShakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.  Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed.  He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.  As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre. \n\nInfluence\n\nShakespeare's work has made a lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre.  Until Romeo and Juliet, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy.  Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events; but Shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds.  His work heavily influenced later poetry. The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success. Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as \"feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.\" \n\nShakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is a classic tragic hero, inspired by King Lear.  Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays.  Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German.  The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature. \n\nIn Shakespeare's day, English grammar, spelling and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now, and his use of language helped shape modern English.  Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his A Dictionary of the English Language, the first serious work of its type.  Expressions such as \"with bated breath\" (Merchant of Venice) and \"a foregone conclusion\" (Othello) have found their way into everyday English speech. \n\nCritical reputation\n\nShakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise.  In 1598, the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English writers as \"the most excellent\" in both comedy and tragedy.  The authors of the Parnassus plays at St John's College, Cambridge numbered him with Chaucer, Gower and Spenser.  In the First Folio, Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the \"Soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage\", though he had remarked elsewhere that \"Shakespeare wanted art\". \n\nBetween the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson.  Thomas Rymer, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, \"I admire him, but I love Shakespeare\".  For several decades, Rymer's view held sway; but during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation.  By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal and Victor Hugo. \n\nDuring the Romantic era, Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge; and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism.  In the 19th century, critical admiration for Shakespeare's genius often bordered on adulation.  \"That King Shakespeare,\" the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840, \"does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible\".  The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale.  The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as \"bardolatry\", claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsen's plays had made Shakespeare obsolete. \n\nThe modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde. The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T.S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare's \"primitiveness\" in fact made him truly modern.  Eliot, along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare's imagery. In the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for \"post-modern\" studies of Shakespeare.  By the 1980s, Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism, feminism, New Historicism, African-American studies, and queer studies.   In a comprehensive reading of Shakespeare's works and comparing Shakespeare literary accomplishments to accomplishments among leading figures in philosophy and theology as well, Harold Bloom has commented that, \"Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He encloses us, because we see with his fundamental perceptions.\" \n\nWorks\n\nClassification of the plays\n\nShakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories and tragedies.  Two plays not included in the First Folio, The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles, Prince of Tyre, are now accepted as part of the canon, with today's scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both.  No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies, Dowden's term is often used.  In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term \"problem plays\" to describe four plays: All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida and Hamlet.  \"Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies\", he wrote. \"We may therefore borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare's problem plays.\"  The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy. \n\nSpeculation about Shakespeare\n\nAuthorship\n\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him.  Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.  Several \"group theories\" have also been proposed.  Only a small minority of academics believe there is reason to question the traditional attribution,  but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century. \n\nReligion\n\nSome scholars claim that members of Shakespeare's family were Catholics, at a time when practicing Catholicism in England was against the law.  Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father, John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. The document is now lost, however, and scholars differ as to its authenticity.  In 1591 the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church \"for fear of process for debt\", a common Catholic excuse.  In 1606, the name of William's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford. As several scholars have noted, whatever his private views, Shakespeare \"conformed to the official state religion\", as Park Honan put it.   Also, Shakespeare's will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptized, and where he is buried. Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare's religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove. \n\nSexuality\n\nFew details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,  and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love.  The 26 so-called \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons. \n\nPortraiture\n\nNo written contemporary description of Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness,  and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as mis-attributions, repaintings and relabelling of portraits of other people."

                "American Experience . The Richest Man in the World: Andrew Carnegie . People & Events | Andrew Carnegie   | PBS\nPeople & Events\nAndrew Carnegie\nOne of the captains of industry of 19th century America, Andrew Carnegie helped build the formidable American steel industry, a process that turned a poor young man into one of the richest entrepreneurs of his age. Later in his life, Carnegie sold his steel business and systematically gave his collected fortune away to cultural, educational and scientific institutions for \"the improvement of mankind.\"\nCarnegie was born in Dunfermline, the medieval capital of Scotland, in 1835. The town was a center of the linen industry, and Andrew's father was a weaver, a profession the young Carnegie was expected to follow. But the industrial revolution that would later make Carnegie the richest man in the world, destroyed the weavers' craft. When the steam-powered looms came to Dunfermline in 1847 hundreds of hand loom weavers became expendable. Andrew's mother went to work to support the family, opening a small grocery shop and mending shoes.\n\"I began to learn what poverty meant,\" Andrew would later write. \"It was burnt into my heart then that my father had to beg for work. And then and there came the resolve that I would cure that when I got to be a man.\"\nAn ambition for riches would mark Carnegie's path in life. However, a belief in political egalitarianism was another ambition he inherited from his family. Andrew's father, his grandfather Tom Morrison and his uncle Tom Jr. were all Scottish radicals who fought to do away with inherited privilege and to bring about the rights of common workers.\nBut Andrew's mother, fearing for the survival of her family, pushed the family to leave the poverty of Scotland for the possibilities in America. She borrowed 20 pounds she needed to pay the fare for the Atlantic passage and in 1848 the Carnegies joined two of Margaret's sisters in Pittsburgh, then a sooty city that was the iron-manufacturing center of the country.\nWilliam Carnegie secured work in a cotton factory and his son Andrew took work in the same building as a bobbin boy for $1.20 a week. Later, Carnegie worked as a messenger boy in the city's telegraph office. He did each job to the best of his ability and seized every opportunity to take on new responsibilities. For example, he memorized Pittsburgh's street lay-out as well as the important names and addresses of those he delivered to.\nCarnegie often was asked to deliver messages to the theater. He arranged to make these deliveries at night--and stayed on to watch plays by Shakespeare and other great playwrights. In what would be a life-long pursuit of knowledge, Carnegie also took advantage of a small library that a local benefactor made available to working boys.\nOne of the men Carnegie met at the telegraph office was Thomas A. Scott, then beginning his impressive career at Pennsylvania Railroad. Scott was taken by the young worker and referred to him as \"my boy Andy,\"  hiring him as his private secretary and personal telegrapher at $35 a month.\n\"I couldn't imagine,\" Carnegie said many years later. \"what I could ever do with so much money.\" Ever eager to take on new responsibilities, Carnegie worked his way up the ladder in Pennsylvania Railroad and succeeded Scott as superintendent of the Pittsburgh Division. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Scott was hired to supervise military transportation for the North and Carnegie worked as his right hand man.\nThe Civil War fueled the iron industry, and by the time the war was over, Carnegie saw the potential in the field and resigned from Pennsylvania Railroad. It was one of many bold moves that would typify Carnegie's life in industry and earn him his fortune. He then turned his attention to the Keystone Bridge Company, which worked to replace wooden bridges with stronger iron ones. In three years he had an annual income of $50,000.\nHowever, Andrew expressed his uneasiness with the businessman's life. In a letter to himself at age 33, he wrote: \"To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery. I will resign business at thirty-five, but during the ensuing two years I wish to spend the afternoons in receiving instruction and in reading systematically.\"\nCarnegie would continue making unparalleled amounts of money for the next 30 years. Two years after he wrote that letter Carnegie would embrace a new steel refining process being used by Englishman Henry Bessemer to convert huge batches of iron into steel, which was much more flexible than brittle iron. Carnegie threw his own money into the process and even borrowed heavily to build a new steel plant near Pittsburgh. Carnegie was ruthless in keeping down costs and managed by the motto \"watch costs and the profits take care of themselves.\"\n\"I think Carnegie's genius was first of all, an ability to foresee how things were going to change,\" says historian John Ingram. \"Once he saw that something was of potential benefit to him, he was willing to invest enormously in it.\"\nCarnegie was unusual among the industrial captains of his day because he preached for the rights of laborers to unionize and to protect their jobs. However, Carnegie's actions did not always match his rhetoric. Carnegie's steel workers were often pushed to long hours and low wages. In the Homestead Strike of 1892, Carnegie threw his support behind plant manager Henry Frick, who locked out workers and hired Pinkerton thugs to intimidate strikers. Many were killed in the conflict, and it was an episode that would forever hurt Carnegie's reputation and haunt the man.\nStill, Carnegie's steel juggernaut was unstoppable, and by 1900 Carnegie Steel produced more of the metal than all of Great Britain. That was also the year that financier J. P. Morgan mounted a major challenge to Carnegie's steel empire. While Carnegie believed he could beat Morgan in a battle lasting five, 10 or 15 years, the fight did not appeal to the 64-year old man eager to spend more time with his wife Louise, whom he had married in 1886, and their daughter, Margaret.\nCarnegie wrote the asking price for his steel business on a piece of paper and had one of his managers deliver the offer to Morgan. Morgan accepted without hesitation, buying the company for $480 million. \"Congratulations, Mr. Carnegie,\" Morgan said to Carnegie when they finalized the deal. \"you are now the richest man in the world.\"\nFond of saying that \"the man who dies rich dies disgraced,\" Carnegie then turned his attention to giving away his fortune. He abhorred charity, and instead put his money to use helping others help themselves. That was the reason he spent much of his collected fortune on establishing over 2,500 public libraries as well as supporting institutions of higher learning. By the time Carnegie's life was over, he gave away 350 million dollars.\nCarnegie also was one of the first to call for a \"league of nations\" and he built a \"a palace of peace\" that would later evolve into the World Court. His hopes for a civilized world of peace were destroyed, though, with the onset of World War I in 1914. Louise said that with these hostilities her husband's \"heart was broken.\" Carnegie lived for another five years, but the last entry in his autobiography was the day World War I began.",
                "Andrew Carnegie Vs. Sam Walton  :: Biography\nAndrew Carnegie Vs. Sam Walton\nLength: 907 words (2.6 double-spaced pages)\nRating: Excellent\nOpen Document\nCarnegie Vs. Walton\nIn this essay I was asked to compare Wal-Mart's Sam Walton to a 19th century business tycoon.  I chose to do Andrew Carnegie who was the leader of the steel industry in the late 1800's.  Both these men had different views on competition, government involvement, interaction with labor and charity.\nAndrew Carnegie helped build the American steel industry.  He was born in 1835 in Dunfermline, Scotland, to Margaret and Will Carnegie. The Carnegies are one of the many working-class families in Dunfermline.  The family left the poverty of Scotland for the possibilities in America in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  As he got older, he moved rapidly through a series of jobs with the Western Union and the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1865, he resigned from the railroad to establish his own business and eventually organized the Carnegie Steel Company, which launched the steel industry in Pittsburgh.\nSam Walton was born on March 29, 1918 to Thomas Gibson and Nancy Lee Walton near Kingfisher, Oklahoma.  They lived on a small farm but when that was proven non-profitable they moved out of Oklahoma to many towns across Missouri.  Sam Walton was the starting quarterback for his football team and was an honors student.  He attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in Economics.  After a few setbacks Sam decided he wanted to own his own department store.  His dream came a reality in the fall of 1945 when he purchased a store in Newport, Missouri with the help of his father-in-law.\nAndrew Carnegie had no competition.  By 1900 Carnegie Steel produced more metal than all of Great Britain.  He controlled almost all of the steel produced and used in America.  Carnegie used vertical integration , which means that he owned all the companies and resources need to make and process steel, thus giving him the edge and he was able to cut down costs.\nUnlike Carnegie, as Sam Walton's business grew he took out more and more competition from other department stores.   His store led in sales and profits even when it was newly opened. Sam made this possible by properly stocking all the shelves with a wide range of goods with very low prices, keeping his store centrally located so it was easily accessible to many customers, stayed open later than most stores especially during Christmas seasons, and experimented with discount merchandising.\nHow to Cite this Page\nMLA Citation:\n    Sort By:\n \nAll these were ideas were new to businesses but Sam caught on fast and was able to use them to his advantage.\nAndrew Carnegie had very little government help in his steel company.  He worked for everything he achieved and is truly a pioneer.  Unlike Carnegies steel business the government in very involved in Wal-Mart they allow Wal-Mart to clear land in new towns, the government also allows them to trade with china which does not benefit our economy.\nCarnegie's steel workers were often pushed to long hours and low wages.   However, Carnegie defends unions.  He published an essay in Forum Magazine defending workers rights to organize into a union. He also published Triumphant Democracy, which sold over 70,000 copies and celebrates the American belief in democracy and capitalism. Carnegie was unusual among the industrial captains of his day because he preached for the rights of laborers to unionize and to protect their jobs.\nSam Walton's company is known to poorly treat its workers.  The are known for working there employees long hours sometimes not under the clock.  In today's world they pay their employees an average of thirteen dollars per hour and expect them to have medical benefits through Medicare.  This makes it nearly impossible to contribute to a family on these type of wages.\nCarnegie played a big role into society.  He established over 2,500 public libraries as well as supporting institutions of higher learning. By the time Carnegie's life was over, he gave away 350 million dollars to charity.  When Carnegie sold his steel business he gave his fortune away to cultural, educational and scientific institutions for \"the improvement of mankind. This included the building of 3,000 public libraries, the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the Carnegie Institution of Washington for research into the natural and physical sciences. Carnegie also established the Endowment for International Peace in an effort to prevent future wars.\nSimilar to Carnegies steel business Wal-Mart gives money away to charity as well.  The make major contributions to such organizations as American Red Cross, Boys & Girls Clubs, Children's Miracle Network and the American Cancer Society as well as many others.  The have given roughly one million dollars to American Heart Association, Big Brothers & Big Sisters, Give Kids the World, Special Olympics and the Young Men's Christian Association.  However with the amount of money Wal-Mart brings in they have only donated less than one percent of their profits.\nIf I could choose to emulate one business it would be Andrew Carnegie's steel business.  I believe Carnegie truly used hard work and determination to open his business, he believed in traditional values such as protecting the rights of workers. By 1900 Carnegie Steel's annual profit is $40 million.  He controlled his entire industry and sold his company for to J.P. Morgan for $480 million, a move that makes Carnegie the richest man in the world.",

What kind of conditions were needed for industrialization?\n2 After the Civil War, the United States went through a period of industrialization Big businesses were formed, such as the banks, railroads, oil and coal companies Industrialization helped the U.S. grow, and many immigrants came to the U.S., but for workers life was very difficult\n3 As businesses grew, some began to develop ways to limit competition Carnegie Steelfounded in the 1870s by Andrew Carnegie Steel was used for railroads and skyscrapers\n4 Vertical Integration Carnegie Steel used the vertical integration strategy to create a monopoly in the steel industry Vertical integration is when a company owns all the factors of production (all the things you need to make a product) Carnegie Steel could produce steel cheaper than his competitors\n5 Standard Oil Company founded in the 1870s by John D. Rockefeller Originally produced kerosene as heating oil Today, the following companies used to make up Standard Oil: ExxonMobil Chevron BP\n6 Horizontal Integration Standard Oil gained a monopoly through horizontal integration Horizontal Integration is when one company buys or takes over its competition These monopolies were also known as trusts\n7 Do Now 1. Explain the difference between horizontal and vertical integration. 2. Do you think monopolies are good or bad for America? Give examples to support your answer. Put your answers on ½ sheet of paper. You will hand this in for a quiz grade!\n8 Many industrial leaders viewed themselves in a positive way compared to everyone else They believed in Social Darwinism This idea means that those who get wealthy are better than those who dont This idea justified laissez- faire capitalism\n9 Many industrialists, like Carnegie and Rockefeller, gained more wealth than they could ever spend They gained wealth by cutting costs in any way possible Low wages for workers Poor working conditions Unethical business practices They often became known as Robber Barons because of this\n10 Some industrial leaders also were known as Captains of Industry Carnegie, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and others used much of their wealth to contribute to society They were considered philanthropists (people who give away their money Vanderbilt University Carnegie Hall Rockefeller Center Rockefeller donated $450 million before he died Carnegie donated enough money for 2,500 libraries to be built\n11 1. Explain why industrialists like Carnegie and Rockefeller would have supported the concept of Social Darwinism, while workers would have opposed it. 2. a) Compare and contrast vertical and horizontal integration. b) How did they lead to the creation of monopolies?\n12 Some industrialists thought their wealth should not be left to their descendants Andrew Carnegie wrote the Gospel of Wealth in 1889\n13 Labor Union A group of workers who unite to improve their wages, working conditions and benefits They were created because of low wages and poor conditions in industry Workers had few rights and no protection from the government\n14 How did labor unions get better conditions, wages, etc? Collective bargaining Negotiations between the owners and workers Strikes Boycotts Whether you're a union member or not, you have benefited from labor unions. They have set a national and local standard for working conditions, i.e., the 40-hour work week, the five-day work week, collective bargaining, fair grievance procedures, minimum wage, acceptable working conditions, insurance, retirement packages, sick leave, paid vacations and much more. --Green Bay Gazette, February 28, 2011 List some of the benefits that all workers have gained as a result of labor unions.\n15 Two different types of labor unions emerged: 1. Unskilled Unions Unions that allowed all workers to join regardless of skill or profession Allowed women and African-Americans Knights of Labor 2. Skilled Unions Workers organized by their particular skill Ex. Carpenters, ironworkers The American Federation of Labor (AFL) Founded by Samuel Gompers in 1886\n16 Haymarket Strike 1886 Homestead Strike 1892 Pullman Strike 1894 The government supported the owners, not the workers in labor disputes\n17 \" In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the person ' s becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American... There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn ' t an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag... We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language... and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.\" 1. Do you think this quote is from A. before the Civil War B. after the Civil War C. the modern day 2. Why do you think its from the time period you chose above? 3. Which group of immigrants do you think this quote is about?\n18 This is a quote from Teddy Roosevelt in 1907 Do you think the quote reflects opinion towards immigrants today?\n19 For all the noise and anger that too often surrounds the immigration debate, America has nothing to fear from todays immigrants. They have come here for the same reason that families have always come here– for the hope that in America, they could build a better life for themselves and their families. Like the waves of immigrants that came before them and the Hispanic Americans whose families have been here for generations, the recent arrival of Latino immigrants will only enrich our country --Barack Obama\n20 Immigration Until the 1840s, most immigrants came from Northwest Europe (England, Scotland, etc) and Africa (forced because of slavery) From the 1840s to 1860s, there were many immigrants from Ireland (largely Catholic) Immigration – when people leave their own country for a new country\n21 Immigration Why did many immigrants come to the United States? Freedom Better job opportunities\n22 After the Civil War ( ), millions of immigrants came to the U.S. Many came from Southern and Eastern Europe (Italy, Russia, the Balkans) and Asia (China) Many immigrants during this period experienced Nativism\n23 Nativism – discrimination by native-born Americans against immigrants 1850s the Know- Nothing Party was created as an anti- immigrant political party (against Irish immigration) Why did nativism spread? Competition for factory jobs Lower wages Ethnic, cultural, and religious differences Fear of new ideas like socialism, communism, and anarchy\n24 Why would big business support more immigration? More workers Lower wages (cheap labor) Over 12 million immigrants came to the U.S. through Ellis Island\n25 At the turn of the century, why did most immigrants to the United States settle in cities? A. Jobs were readily available. B. Government relief programs required immigrants to settle in cities. C. Labor union leaders encouraged unrestricted immigration. D. Immigrants were not permitted to buy farmland. In the late 19th century, the pattern of United States immigration changed in that A. far fewer immigrants arrived in the United States than in previous years B. most immigrants chose to settle in the rural, farming regions of the western United States C. increasing numbers of immigrants came from eastern and southern Europe D. most immigrants were political refugees\n26 Urbanization – the movement of people from the country (rural) to the cities Why did people move to the cities?

It is one of nine in the Bronx (eight still extant) and one of sixty-seven throughout all five boroughs, built when Andrew Carnegie donated $5.2 million in 1901 to establish a city-wide branch library system. The firm of Carrère & Hastings, architects of the New York Public Library building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, designed the Hunts Point Branch in the style of the Italian Renaissance. This striking building was the firm’s fourteenth and last Carnegie library. The library’s open plan and palazzo-inspired style are characteristic of the suburban Carnegie library type; notable architectural features include the building’s symmetry and horizontal massing, elegant blind arcade, richly detailed terra-cotta ornament, and arched first and second-floor windows providing abundant light to the simple interior The Hunts Point Branch has played a prominent role in the neighborhood for eighty years.\n \nEarly Twentieth-Century Development of Hunts Point\n \nHunts Point, along with Clason’s Point, Screvin’s Neck, and Throg’s Neck, is one of several large salt meadowland peninsulas in the Bronx that jut into the East River. Before European colonization, the Hunts Point area of the Bronx was associated with the Siwanoy Native Americans, a sub-group of the regionally dominant Wappinger group, which was part of the broader Algonquian cultural and linguistic group. Until the Civil War, Hunts Point was characterized as a rural area where prominent businessmen maintained country estates. As with many New York City neighborhoods, the creation and availability of transit routes to the Hunts Point area in the early twentieth century helped initiate development of the once-remote area. The opening of the extension of the West Side IRT subway into the Bronx in 1904 helped bring about a period of feverish land speculation southeast of Westchester Avenue near the transit line. The opening of the Intervale Avenue subway station in 1910, in particular, has been an acknowledged impetus for development near Hunts Point. The Hunts Point station of the New Haven Railroad, Harlem River branch, which had opened in the 1850s, began serving the area as a station of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway line after 1912.\n \nIn addition to increased transportation options, local boosters could point to the many advantages the South Bronx offered to industry, including the excellent rail service and freight terminals of several major lines that provided the means for transporting raw materials, supplies, and finished products conveniently. There were ample sites for building in the vicinity of the waterfront or adjacent to rail lines, and the power to operate facilities was relatively inexpensive because of the easy access to coal deliveries. The growing local labor force could be supplemented by workers traveling to the Bronx via the rail and transit lines. In 1909, there were 700 factories in the Bronx; by 1912, the number of industrial operations in the borough had more than doubled. By the close of the first decade of the twentieth century, the local real estate press enthused that “a great city [was] building along Southern Boulevard.”\n \nAt the start of the twentieth century most of the Hunts Point area was controlled by a small number of real estate developers, including George F. Johnson and James F. Meehan, who were developing elevator apartment houses, flats, and semi-detached houses near the subway stops. Construction of housing, including semi-detached houses and multiple dwellings of various sizes, in Hunts Point and in the nearby area accelerated after 1912. By 1915 most of the area around Southern Boulevard between Intervale Avenue and East 163rd Street had been developed with 5-story apartment buildings and 4-story rowhouses. The population housed by the new residential construction in Hunts Point was largely Jewish; other groups included African-Americans and people of Italian and Irish descent, and later a significant wave of Puerto Rican immigrants. A Catholic church, rectory and school occupied the lot next to the future Hunts Point Branch library site, which remained vacant land until construction of the library began in 1928.\n \nHistory of New York City Libraries\n \nIn the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries libraries in New York City were private, institutional, or subscription. The New York Society Library, a subscription library where users paid a membership fee, was established in 1754, and Columbia University opened a library by 1757. Both were destroyed during the Revolutionary War but were rebuilt, and by 1876 Columbia had one of the largest collections in the country. Reading rooms, operated as businesses or by non-profit organizations, made books available to the public, and bookseller Garrett Noel opened the earliest known reading room in 1763.\n \nInstitutions including the New-York Historical Society, the Cooper Union, and Union Theological Seminary opened libraries in the first half of the nineteenth century. New York State legislation enabling City support of libraries was passed in the 1830s, but libraries were privately supported for most of the nineteenth century. The Astor Library, the City’s first free public reference library, incorporated in 1849. The Lenox Library, a private collection of rare and reference books, incorporated in 1870. By 1876, there were about ninety various libraries and collections in New York City.\n \nThe earliest branch library system was the private New York Free Circulating Library, established in 1878 to provide education and self-help for the poor. Support came from Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt and other wealthy New Yorkers, and from public funds beginning in 1887. There were eleven branches by 1901. The smaller Aguilar Free Library Society was started in 1886 to foster the “free circulation of carefully selected literature, in the homes of the people of this City, with distributing branches in localities where the Jewish population was dense.”  The organization, later associated with the Educational Alliance, was named after Grace Aguilar, an English novelist and Sephardic Jew. There were four branches by 1901.\n \nHistory of Bronx Libraries\n \nAs early as 1872 a small lending library was operating out of a greenhouse on the William E. Dodge estate in Riverdale. Under the initiative of Miss Grace Dodge, this small library collection led to the founding of the Riverdale Library Association in 1883. Shortly thereafter, Riverdale residents Mr. and Mrs. Percy R. Pyne donated funds for the construction of a library on a donated plot of land; the Riverdale Library was the precursor to the Riverdale Branch of the New York Public Library. Another early library was the Van Schaick Free Reading Room, a designated New York City Landmark at Westchester Square, which was donated to the community by local philanthropist Peter C. Van Schaick in 1882-23 and designed by Frederick Clarke Withers. The library was expanded to the designs of William Anderson in 1890, when it was endowed by railroad tycoon and Throg’s Neck resident Collis P. Huntington, and renamed. The Huntington Free Library and Reading Room is still administered by its trustees and functions as a non-circulating library open to the public. Church libraries included those belonging to the Brotherhood of Andrew and Philip and to the Mott Avenue Methodist Church.\n \nThe Kingsbridge Free Library and the Riverdale Library were founded prior to 1900, while the High Bridge Free Library and the Bronx Free Library were both founded in 1901, the latter being mainly an adult education organization. All four were eventually absorbed into the New York Public Library system, which at the time was operating a “traveling” branch that periodically circulated books in neighborhoods not served by a permanent branch.\n \nThe New York Public Library and Andrew Carnegie\n \nThe New York Public Library was established in 1895 as a private corporation, which received limited public funds. Formed initially by the merger of the Astor and Lenox Libraries and the Tilden Trust, it was primarily concerned with building a major reference library on the site of the old Croton Reservoir at Fifth Avenue on 42nd Street. The consolidation of New York City in 1898 inspired the growth and unification of the library institutions in the City, including the New York Public Library.\n \nNew York was one of the largest cities in the world with a population of three million in 1898 and growing rapidly. It trailed behind other cities in public library support, ranking ninth in per capita spending. A public branch library system was established in 1901 when the New York Free Circulating Library merged with The New York Public Library. Most of the small independent lending libraries, such as the Aguilar, Webster, Kingsbridge, and Tottenville, joined the New York Public Library, increasing the size of the still inadequate branch network. The promise of a large grant from Andrew Carnegie in 1901 spurred these library mergers. The New York Public Library is still organized into the separate reference and branch systems that were created during this consolidation.\n \nAndrew Carnegie and John Shaw Billings, Director of the New York Public Library, strongly supported the amalgamation of all the library systems, including Brooklyn and Queens libraries, which ultimately chose to remain independent. Today, New York City still has three separate library corporations, The New York Public Library, Brooklyn Public Library, and the Queens Borough Public Library.\n \nIn 1901, when the library institutions were large and cohesive enough to suit him, Andrew Carnegie donated $5.2 million to New York City to build a system of branch libraries in all five boroughs. The grant was divided among the three library systems, with the New York Public Library receiving $3.36 million, and Brooklyn and Queens allocated $1.6 million and $240,000 respectively. The grant bought sixty-seven libraries in all five boroughs, two more than originally envisioned. In a 1901 letter to John Shaw Billings, Carnegie said that “sixty-five libraries at one stroke probably breaks the record, but this is the day of big operations and New York is soon to be the biggest of Cities.”\n \nAndrew Carnegie rose from poverty to become one of the wealthiest men in the United States after he sold his steel business to J.P. Morgan in 1901. He began donating to libraries in 1881, but with the grant to New York City he started the vast, worldwide operation which made him unique in the world of philanthropy.\n \nAndrew Carnegie based his donations on a philosophy of giving he developed in the 1870s and 1880s. He believed that the wealthy should live modestly and, while still living, give away their funds for the good of humanity. He considered seven areas worthy of his philanthropy: universities, libraries, medical centers, parks, meeting and concert halls, public baths, and churches. Like other wealthy New Yorkers involved in the social reform movement, he understood the problems facing New York City at the beginning of the twentieth century: the overcrowding from massive immigration, poverty, lack of education and absence of such facilities as baths, playgrounds and libraries. Andrew Carnegie gave away about 90 per cent of his wealth by the time he died in 1911. More than 2,500 Carnegie libraries were built worldwide and over 1,680 in the United States. The library program ended in 1917 but the Carnegie Corporation and twenty other foundations and funds have carried on his aspirations.\n \nThe inventor of cost accounting, Carnegie gave away his money with great efficiency. His grant provided for the construction of the buildings, but New York City had to contribute the cost of the land as well as the books, the upkeep and the operation of the libraries in perpetuity. The acquisition of sites alone cost the New York Public Library over $1.6 million, just under half the cost of the buildings.\n \nIn 1901, the New York Public Library Board Executive Committee appointed a temporary architects’ advisory committee consisting of Charles F. McKim of the firm McKim, Mead & White, John M. Carrère of Carrère & Hastings, and Walter Cook of Babb, Cook & Willard, to advise them on how to proceed with construction. The committee advised that the branches be uniform and recognizable in materials, style, plan and scale and that different site requirements would provide variety. They recommended forming a committee of two to five architectural firms who would design the buildings in cooperation with each other. Andrew Carnegie objected to the lack of competition in this system but was ultimately convinced that it would be faster and cheaper and would produce a more unified collection. The advisors, McKim, Carrère, and Cook, were fortuitously selected for the permanent committee, and their firms designed most of The New York Public Library Carnegie branches. The architects consulted with the librarians on planning and design, an innovation recently adopted in library design.\n \nCarrère & Hastings\n \nThe important architectural firm of Carrère & Hastings designed many of New York City’s most prominent structures, including the New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations (1898-1911), Grand Army Plaza (1913), the Manhattan Bridge Arch and Colonnade (1905), and the Staten Island Borough Hall (1903-07) (all designated New York City Landmarks). John Merven Carrère (1858-1911) and Thomas Hastings (1860-1929) met in Paris while studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Carrère, whose previous education was in Switzerland, graduated in 1882 and Hastings, who briefly attended Columbia University, graduated in 1884. Their architectural style was heavily influenced by their studies in Paris. Both men were hired out of school by the office of McKim, Mead & White and in 1885 they formed their own firm.\n \nThe firm’s earliest commissions were churches or hotels in St. Augustine, Florida, designed for the famous developer and partner in Standard Oil, Henry Flagler. Their early hotels include the Ponce de Leon (1888) in St. Augustine, the Laurel-in-the-Pines (1889-90) in Lakewood, New Jersey, and the Hotel Jefferson (1893-94) in Richmond, Virginia. The majority of their significant work was in New York City, but they were responsible for the House and Senate Office Buildings (1906) in Washington, D.C. and Woolsey and Memorial Halls (1906) at Yale University.\n \nCarrère & Hastings designed a wide variety of building types. They introduced the French Beaux-Arts style townhouse to New York City with the Richard Hoe House (1892, 9 East 71st Street, demolished) and the Dr. Christian A. Herter House (1892, 819 Madison Avenue, part of the Upper East Side Historic District), influencing a generation of urban residential building. Early, important houses include the Henry T. and Jessie Sloane House (1894-96, now the Lycée Francaise) at 9 East 72nd Street and the John Henry and Emily Vanderbilt Sloane Hammon House (1902-03, now the Russian Consulate) at 9 East 91st Street. The versatile firm designed the Globe Theater (now the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 1909-10) at 203-17 West 46th Street and First Church of Christ, Scientist (1899-1903) at 1 west 96th Street. All of these buildings are designated New York City Landmarks.\n \nThe firm won the competition for the New York Public Library Main Building in 1897. This monumental Beaux-Arts style building was a major influence on early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts architecture in New York. The firm proceeded to design fourteen classically-inspired Carnegie branch libraries in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island from 1904 to 1929. All three of their branches in the Bronx have survived: the Tremont (1905), Melrose (1914) and Hunts Point (1929) Branches.\n \nJohn Carrère lived on Staten Island and helped plan the borough’s Civic Center. The firm designed several of the major buildings in the Civic Center area, including the above-named Staten Island Borough Hall, the Richmond County Courthouse (1913-19, both designated New York City Landmarks), the St. George Branch Carnegie library (1907), and the old Ferry Terminal (1908, burned). The firm was responsible for several other buildings on Staten Island, including three other Carnegie branch libraries, the Tottenville (1904, a designated New York City Landmark) and Stapleton (1907) libraries, the Vanderbilt model houses (1900) in Clifton, and the Hughes Memorial Branch Library (1928).\n \nCarrère & Hastings were active and influential in the architectural profession; both served as directors of the American Institute of Architects and both were elected Fellows. Carrère was a director of the American Academy in Rome and member of the Beaux Arts Society, the New York City Art Commission and Federation of Fine Arts. Hastings was president of the Architectural League of New York. John Carrère died in an automobile accident in 1911 and Thomas Hastings continued the work of the firm, which included the remaining Carnegie libraries (Hastings died shortly after the completion of the Hunts Point Branch), the Standard Oil Building (1920-26, with Shreve, Lamb & Harmon) at 26 Broadway, and the Cunard Building (1917-21, with Benjamin Wistar Morris) at 25 Broadway (both designated New York City Landmarks).\n \nDesign of the New York Public Library, Hunts Point Branch\n \nThe New York City Carnegie branch libraries share many design characteristics and are clearly recognizable as Carnegie libraries. They were designed to stand out as separate and distinct structures, an innovation in 1901 when most of the branch libraries were located in other buildings. They are classical in style and, with few exceptions, a simplified version of the Beaux-Arts model, similar to most public buildings designed in this period. They are clad in limestone, or in brick with limestone or terra-cotta trim. There are two distinct types, the urban and suburban. In Manhattan and densely developed sections of the Bronx, the Carnegie libraries were designed for mid-block sites, a condition which encouraged vertically-oriented palazzo-like facades and simpler interior layouts characterized by a tripartite scheme: vertical circulation was contained along one solid side wall, and front and rear rooms, separated by a librarians’ station, were aligned along a second side wall, typically lined with bookshelves. On less restrictive sites in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, a freestanding library typically had a symmetrical front with a central entrance leading to a room containing the librarians’ station, which was flanked on two sides by large reading rooms. The second floor contained offices or another reading room; the basement accommodated a packing room, boiler and toilets.\n \nThe plans of the Carnegie libraries were drawn up in collaboration with the architects’ committee and the librarians. The librarians met with the committee at the beginning of the process and commented on the final plans. The majority of the libraries featured offset entrances and stairs, a concession to the librarians. While the architects preferred classical center entrances, the offset entrances and elevated first floors provided for spacious, light-filled reading rooms. A prominent circulation desk afforded control of the entire reading room by a single librarian. There were accessible stacks, an innovation in the early twentieth century; nineteenth-century library book stacks were off limits to everyone except the librarians.\n \nThe Hunts Point Branch followed the suburban model, taking advantage of a corner site to provide a Children’s Entrance on Tiffany Street, in addition to the main entrance on Southern Boulevard. The library’s centered main entrance lead into a small vestibule opening onto a large open-plan room with a circulation desk in the center, circulating stacks to the left, and a reading room/ reference area with a fireplace to the right. An office, work room, locker room, and service stair lined the back wall of the room, opposite the entrance. The second floor was dedicated to children and could be reached via the Children’s Entrance stairwell (also accessible from the main library floor); a circulation desk and circulating stacks occupied the left portion of the second floor, a reading room/ reference area with a fireplace occupied the right, and a work room and service stair lined the back wall. A patio and garden behind the library was accessible via a door on the main library floor. The architecture of the Hunts Point Branch was unusual among the Carnegie libraries for its strong reference to the architecture of the Italian Renaissance; the elegant arcade accented by roundels explicitly referred to architect Filippo Brunelleschi’s early 15th-century Spedale degli Innocenti (Foundling Hospital) in Florence. A review of the new branch in the Bulletin of The New York Public Library described the building thus:\n \nThe exterior architectural design is fourteenth-century Florentine, the windows on the front and Tiffany Street facades showing effective use of the loggia style. The materials used – stone, brick and terra cotta tile – corresponded as closely as was practicable to those used in the Florentine prototypes.\n \nAnother unique feature of the Hunts Point Branch was the one-car garage built alongside the library to house the Bronx Book Wagon, which began serving the neighborhood in July of 1928, a full year before the branch opened.\n \nConstruction and Subsequent History\n \nThe New York Public Library selected the sites for the Carnegie libraries with approval from the City. Because every community wanted a Carnegie library, site selection was the only part of the smooth-running building process where there was any contention. The Carnegie branches were intended to stand out in their communities, to be centrally located and, if possible, to be near schools and other civic structures. John S. Billings stated this position in 1901:\n \nEvery one of these buildings ought to be of one distinctive and uniform type, so that the most ignorant child going through the streets of the City will at once know as Carnegie Library when he or she sees it.\n \nThe New York Public Library Executive Committee hired New York attorney Alanson T. Briggs to propose library sites and act as agent to the libraries and liaison to New York City. After identifying densely populated neighborhoods, he looked for centrally located sites in these neighborhoods. George L. Rives, Secretary of The New York Public Library, described the philosophy behind site selection in 1901:\n \nThe trustees are of the opinion that in establishing branch libraries it is of great importance to establish them, as far as possible, in conspicuous positions on well frequented streets. In some measure the same principles should be applied that would govern in the selection of a site for a retail store. The fact that a branch library is constantly before the eyes of the neighboring residents so that all are familiar with its location will undoubtedly rend to increase its usefulness.\n \nSites were approved by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment. Many neighborhoods were vying to be chosen by the library as branch sites, and in 1928 the East Bronx Property Owners group sent a petition to the New York Public Library Trustees urging the construction of a branch library in the underserved East Bronx, which included Hunts Point.\n \nIn the February 25th, 1928 issue of Real Estate Record and Builder’s Guide, a bid for general contractor appeared for a three-story brick and terra cotta library building to be built for the City of New York; the building notice appeared in the April 28th issue of RERBG, listing the cost for the library construction at $130,504. The contractor eventually selected was the E.E. Paul Company, the same contractor Carrère & Hastings had hired to build several of their other Carnegie libraries. The Hunts Point Branch appears to be the only Carnegie library for which Carrère & Hastings chose terra cotta as a building material; it is used to sumptuous effect in the deep arcade running across the primary façade; the elegant arched window and door surrounds; the corbelled cornice; and the “New York Public Library” sign. It is likely that the terra cotta was manufactured by the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company, which was based in Staten Island and manufactured architectural terra cotta for the New York City building market from its founding in 1897 until it went out of business in 1943.\n \nThe sixty-seventh and last of the Carnegie libraries to be built in New York City, the Hunts Point Branch opened on July 1, 1929, despite unfinished interiors. The 12,000 square-foot library building plus equipment cost approximately $151,875, finally exhausting the Carnegie funds. The opening ceremony was presided over by the head of the New York Public Library Circulation Department, and 300 children lined up at the Children’s Entrance waiting to take out library cards. The library began operating with 14,000 books and a staff of nineteen librarians. As early as 1934, Hunts Point’s head librarian wrote to the Trustees of the New York Public Library requesting funding for an expansion to accommodate much-needed activity space and an additional reading room. Following the award of $2.5 million in Works Progress Administration funding to the New York Public Library in 1935, the library received the sought after addition, a two-story rear extension completed in 1938.\n \nBetween 1952 and 1954, the library was closed for interior repairs. The library received a new roof in 1980, and two years later the original six-over-six wood sash windows with tympanum lights were replaced with square-headed aluminum sash windows described by the head librarian at the time as “a disaster.” By the nineties, the library was in need of serious repairs and basic upgrades. The building’s plight finally caught the public’s attention in 1996 after a sizeable chunk of terra cotta fell from the cornice to the sidewalk; a community group then launched a fundraising campaign, and in 1999 the City Council representative for the area pledged $500,000 of the $2.75 million needed for a full interior and exterior restoration. The project included façade repair and restoration, a new roof, and interior restoration and reprogramming; the work was completed in 2002 and won the New York Landmarks Conservancy’s Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award.\n \nOver its eighty years of existence, the Hunts Point Branch has been a positive social force and an anchor in a community beset by economic disinvestment, inadequate public services, and periodic violence. The branch has a history of serving the largely immigrant population of Hunts Point, offering books in Hebrew, Yiddish, and Spanish as early as 1941 and developing a strong Spanish-English bilingual program by the 1970s. The branch has long been known for its substantial Hispanic Heritage Collection, the foundation of which can be traced to 1946. Under the leadership of librarian Lilian Lopez and with support from a federal grant, the Hispanic Heritage Collection was significantly expanded in the 1960s and continues to be cultivated today. Beginning in the 1970s, Hunts Point experienced economic crises and waves of arson and violence that earned the neighborhood a reputation as one of the poorest and most dangerous in the entire city. During these difficult years, the Hunts Point Branch – like library branches all over the city – faced successive budget cuts that resulted in reduced or irregular hours and cuts in services. The Bronx Book Mobile, which began in 1928 as the Bronx Book Wagon, stopped serving the South Bronx community in the 1980s. But in recent years the Hunts Point Branch has seen a rebirth, providing the community with improved facilities and wider access to communications technology.\n \nDescription\n \nThe Hunts Point library is an imposing two-story, seven-bay rectangular brick building trimmed with richly detailed terra-cotta ornament. Occupying a prominent corner site, the building is dominated by a deeply articulated blind arcade on the double-height ground story, a stringcourse separating the first and second stories, and a boldly corbelled cornice. The façade brick is laid in common bond, except where noted, and the library’s foundation is a limestone plinth whose profile thins toward the northern edge of the site in accordance with an increase in grade. In the 2002 restoration, portions of the parapet were rebuilt and the library was repointed with a white mortar that is incompatible with the rich color of the brick and terra cotta.\n \nA freestanding one-story brick garage stands adjacent to the library on the west, across a driveway. The garage has a flat roof bordered by limestone coping, and a corrugated metal roll-up door. Two historic wood windows protected by metal bars face the library on the garage’s east façade. The driveway is marked by two limestone-capped brick piers standing on limestone plinths; the top portion of the brick has been rebuilt on both piers. The piers graduate into curving brick cheek walls abutting the garage and the library, respectively. A chain-link gate sits between the piers. Main (East) Facade\n \nCentered on the double-height ground story of the library, the main entry door is reached from the sidewalk by a low flight of four granite stairs. The double door is wood and appears to be original. The two panels in the upper half of the door are glazed, and beneath these are two smaller rectangular panels, followed by two larger panels containing decorative wood diamonds. Brass kickplates protect the bottom of the door, while the door handles and push plates also appear to be brass. The glazed panels are protected by a decorative wrought iron grille. A wood-framed signboard is located on the wall to the right of the main entry. The transom light above the double door is protected by a cast-iron grille of an interlocking fleur-de-lys pattern.\n \nThe door and transom light are surrounded by a thick, flat limestone band. Bronze numbers indicating the library’s address (877 Southern Boulevard) appear in the center of the limestone lintel. A bronze lantern is centered over the bronze numbers. Above the door and limestone band the brick tympanum is laid in a grid of header bond. The door, transom light and tympanum are surrounded by a brick arch two courses deep and two courses wide, the inner course laid in soldier bond and the outer course laid in header bond. The outer brick header course projects slightly from the façade plane above the springing line of the arch.\n \nThe main entry is set within the middle arch of the blind arcade, with three arches flanking it on either side. The inside of each arch is delineated by a slightly projecting brick header course. The blind arcade is supported by an engaged Corinthian order resting on Ionic bases; the Corinthian capitals are executed in terra cotta, while the shafts and bases of the columns are executed in limestone. The Corinthian capitals are decorated with exuberant bunches of acorns, sunflowers, and grapes springing from stylized acanthus leaves. The archivolts of the blind arcade are composed of three bands of molding depicting, from inside outward, a chain of interlocking rings containing stylized rosettes, a leaf-and-dart motif, and an egg-and-dart motif. A series of stylized pendant bellflowers link the egg-and-dart molding between each archivolt. At each end of the arcade, the archivolts terminate in a terra-cotta band course that wraps around the corners of the building. Six plain limestone roundels encircled by a brick header course are centered above the blind arcade between each arch.\n \nThe wall plane within each arch is slightly recessed from the main façade plane, creating a shadow effect under the blind arcade. Each arch contains a round-headed window with non-historic single-pane, double-hung sash with side lights, a transom light, and glazed tympanum. The three first-floor windows are covered by metal security grilles. Set above a simple limestone sill with an ear detail, the windows are framed by a terra-cotta surround. The terra-cotta surround is composed of slender engaged colonettes capped by acanthus-and-rosette capitals supporting an arch of grape-leaf garland crowned by a rosette. The inside of the surround is delineated by a thin band of molding in a leaf-and-dart motif. The surround is framed by a brick soldier course, and framing this is a brick arch of alternating flush and raised headers.\n \nThe second story is marked by a simple limestone stringcourse above a band of terracotta rope molding supported on brick dentils. Seven arched window openings, smaller than the window openings on the first story, sit directly on the stringcourse and are centered above the windows and main entry of the first story. The arched window openings contain non-historic square-headed windows with faux muntins in an eight-over-eight pattern. The windows are framed by a brick arch laid in soldier course springing from a limestone base, and then two bands of terra-cotta molding in a bead-and-reel and leaf-and-dart motif springing from the limestone stringcourse. A limestone keystone interrupts the terra-cotta molding to crown each window. Two floodlights flank the center window, affixed to the window surround near the base of the brick arch. Also affixed to the center window surround, just above the floodlights, are two bronze rosettes each anchoring a mast arm for a flagpole that was removed or fell off at some point. A chip in the limestone stringcourse below the middle window indicates where the flagpole would have been anchored. Four rectangular security lights are affixed to the façade at roughly even intervals just below the stringcourse.\n \nThe corbelled terra-cotta cornice crowning the library is composed of a band of shell-headed niches supported on tightly spaced acanthus consoles, surmounted by rope molding. A short brick parapet wall rises above the cornice and is capped by limestone coping. The band of shell-headed niches terminates just short of the corners of the building, but the rope molding continues around the corners where it is wrapped by grape leaves. The southeast corner of the parapet is marked by square terra-cotta tiles depicting a fleuron (a stylized four-leafed floral ornament); above these tiles and directly below the limestone coping of the parapet wall is one more row of tiles with a simple vertical groove motif. The center section of the cornice broadens to accommodate the inscription “NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY,” which is composed of molded terra-cotta tiles framed by two triglyphs supported on acanthus consoles. Rope molding runs across the cornice’s center section, above the inscription. A band of plain terra-cotta tiles sits above the rope molding and directly below the limestone coping of the parapet wall.\n \nSouth Façade\n \nThe south façade of the library has four bays and continues the design of the main façade on a more modest scale. The fourth and leftmost bay is irregular, lacking the stringcourse and cornice that wrap around from the main façade and unify the three other bays. The leftmost bay contains the Children’s Entrance, apparently unused today, which is accessible via a non-historic brick and concrete ramp with metal pipe railings. The Children’s Entrance contains a black-painted metal door, flanked on the right by a metal panel and surmounted by a sealed transom light protected by a cast-iron grille of an interlocking fleur-de-lys pattern. The lintel above the doorway is a flat brick arch laid in stretcher bond interrupted by a limestone keystone. To the right of the lintel a security light is affixed to the façade. Above the doorway is a limestone plaque with the inscription “CHILDREN’S ENTRANCE.” The fourth-bay wall terminates below the level of the main cornice with a raised brick soldier course and a parapet wall of irregular height. The parapet wall has five battlements capped by curving limestone tiles; in between each battlement is a short section of limestone coping. The parapet wall and two rightmost battlements increase in height to the level of the main cornice, creating a stepped effect for the south façade.\n \nThe three remaining bays of the south façade continue the design from the main façade, with three arched windows on the first and second stories. The string course and cornice described above wrap around from the main façade and continue across these three bays. The terra-cotta band course wraps around from the arcade on the main façade and continues across all four bays of the south façade, interrupted only by the three first-story window surrounds. The three arched windows on the first story contain non-historic sash identical to the first-story windows on the main façade, but have simpler terra-cotta surrounds. The surround is composed of slender engaged colonettes capped by acanthus-and-rosette capitals supporting an arch of reeding wrapped in grape leaves, crowned by a rosette. The inside of the surround is delineated by a thin band of molding in a leaf-and-dart motif. The window arch is framed by a brick soldier course that continues down to meet the limestone foundation, and framing this is an arch of alternating flush and raised headers that becomes a band of flush headers also continuing to the foundation.\n \nEach window sits on a limestone sill with a simple ear detail, and beneath each window is a slightly recessed spandrel panel framed on the top and bottom by header courses in the common-bond façade brick and on the sides by the brick soldier course just described. The three second-story windows sit directly on the denticulated limestone stringcourse. These window openings are smaller than those of the first story, and contain non-historic square-headed sash with faux muntins in an eight-over-eight pattern. Each window is framed by a brick soldier course springing from a limestone base, and then two bands of terra-cotta molding in a bead-and-reel and leaf-and-dart motif springing from the limestone stringcourse. A limestone keystone interrupts the terra-cotta molding to crown each window. A security light is affixed to the façade below the stringcourse at the leftmost window. The windows on the first and second story are covered by metal security grilles. North Façade\n \nThe north façade of the library is a plain brick party wall with terra-cotta tile coping. A one-story, two-car garage is located directly adjacent to library’s north façade. West Facade\n \nThe west façade of the library is partially visible from Tiffany Street, and is marked by several windows and two later brick additions to the main library building. The larger addition is a two-story “L” projecting from the north portion of the original building (the addition was completed in 1938 with WPA funds), and the second addition is a two-story service or elevator core that appears to have been added rather recently. The brick parapet wall of the main library building has terra-cotta tile coping.\n \n- From the 2009 NYCLPC Landmark Designation Report\nDone",

Snead’s multifloor stack systems can still be seen in many important libraries built in that era, for instance at Harvard, Columbia, the Vatican, and at Bryant Park in New York City. Besides storing old bundles of bound paper, Snead’s stacks provided load-bearing structural support to these venerable buildings. To remove the books would literally invite collapse.\nA recent attempt by the New York Public Library to do away with stacks at its main branch and move much of its research collection to New Jersey invited just this concern. Engineers described the idea of removing the shelves that support the Rose Reading Room as “cutting the legs off the table while dinner is being served.” The plan was to transform the interior of the iconic 42nd Street building from its original purpose—a massive storage space for books with a few reading rooms attached—to a more open, services-oriented space with many fewer books on-site. An outcry from scholars and preservationists may yet halt the NYPL’s renovation. A revised version of the plan , which would keep more of the collection onsite, awaits a final verdict later this year. *\nA library without books was once unthinkable. Now it seems almost inevitable.\nThat decision will be just one milestone in the rapidly developing identity crisis of 21st-century libraries. In Snead’s era, a library without books was unthinkable. Now it seems almost inevitable. Like so many other time-honored institutions of intellectual and cultural life—publishing, journalism, and the university, to name a few—the library finds itself on a precipice at the dawn of a digital era. What are libraries for, if not storing and circulating books? With their hearts cut out, how can they survive? \nPillars of civilization at the New York Public Library, 1907.\nPhoto courtesy New York Public Library\nAdvertisement\nThe recent years of austerity have not been kind to the public library. 2012 marked the third consecutive year in which more than 40 percent of states decreased funding for libraries. In 2009, Pennsylvania, the keystone of the old Carnegie library system, came within 15 Senate votes of closing the Free Library of Philadelphia. In the United Kingdom, a much more severe austerity program shuttered 200 public libraries in 2012 alone.\nOurs is not the first era to turn its back on libraries. The Roman Empire boasted an informal system of public libraries, stretching from Spain to the Middle East, which declined and disappeared in the early medieval period. In his book Libraries: An Unquiet History , Matthew Battles calls such disasters “biblioclasms.”\nThe most commonly invoked image of biblioclasm is the burning of the Library of Alexandria, probably the greatest-ever collection of Hellenic manuscripts, many of which are now lost to history. In most versions of the story, the arson was committed by early Christian zealots or by invading Arabs under the banner of Islam. Indeed, either group might have seen the burning of the pagan Library as an act of devotion and a net gain for civilization. Just as likely, however, the fire is a myth that obscures a long, slow decline, and the flames that brought down the ancient library were fed not by a single man or group, but by the winds of history—changing reading habits, political instability, and the decline of the administrative state.\nWill the digital age mark another era of decline for libraries? To an observer from an earlier era, unfamiliar with the screens and devices now crowding out printed books, it may look that way at first. On the other hand, even the smallest device with a Web browser now promises access to a reserve of knowledge vast and varied enough to rival that of Alexandria. If the current digital explosion throws off a few sparks, and a few vestigial elements of libraries, like their paper books and their bricks-and-mortar buildings, are consigned to flames, should we be concerned? Isn’t it a net gain? \nA 19th-century imagining of the burning of the Library of Alexandria.\nImage courtesy Ambrose Dudley/The Stapleton Collection/The Bridgeman Art Library\nAdvertisement\nLibraries have come a long way since Alexandria, of course. Much of what we’d miss if they disappeared are more recent traditions, dating back a few hundred years.\nIn 1888, Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie endowed a public library in Braddock, Penn., connected by an underground tunnel to a steel works he owned. As an immigrant working boy, he had been the beneficiary of an informal lending-library operated by a prominent Pittsburgher, and Carnegie wanted to pay the favor on to the next generation of strivers. Over the next decades, as he became one of the richest men on the planet, he devoted a substantial part of his fortune to building what would become the backbone of the American public library system—about 2,500 Carnegie libraries stretching from Maine to California.\nThough tastes and designs have shifted, a few of the ideals enshrined in the old Carnegie libraries are still held dear today. They are monumental, carrying a reader up a flight of stairs into a beautiful building, evoking a temple of learning. The layout, with books arranged in alcoves and open shelves, encourages random browsing. Most importantly, the space is egalitarian and open to all (though Carnegie did endow so-called “separate but equal” libraries in the South). Carnegie libraries exemplify what sociologist Ray Oldenburg calls a “ third place ”—neither work nor home, a universally accessible space where citizens are free to congregate and fraternize without feeling like loiterers.\nThese ideals can still be seen in the design of many more recent libraries, even if today they’re more likely to be built in a strip mall or a converted Walmart. \nLeft, the first Carnegie Library in Braddock, Penn. It has recently been threatened by closure. Right, a converted Walmart in McAllen, Texas.\nPhoto courtesy Christopher Rolinson/Braddock Carnegie Library/Wikimedia; ©Lara Swimmer Photography\nAdvertisement\nThese design benefits were ancillary, of course, to the fundamental purpose of the Carnegie libraries—access to “the precious treasures of knowledge and imagination through which youth may ascend,” in the words of the benefactor. If Carnegie were alive today, however, an Internet connection and perhaps a good e-book lending program would be enough to provide him treasures beyond his wildest dreams.\nLibraries have compensated for this shift by redefining their mission around providing access to new technologies. The slow invasion of computer clusters that has defined the past two decades of library design serves an important purpose, but that mission, too, now seems increasingly redundant. Already, three-quarters of Americans access the Internet at home, with both broadband and mobile access rising steadily, particularly among younger people. It seems unlikely that providing on-site public access to online media will be a compelling justification for funding brick-and-mortar libraries even a decade from now.\nInstead, librarians have begun to identify a rationale for institutional survival in the ancillary public benefits noted above, in particular the principle of a “third place” focused on learning. The British writer Caitlin Moran, mourning the closings of public libraries in her country, eloquently defends the ideal:\nA library in the middle of a community is a cross between an emergency exit, a life raft and a festival. They are cathedrals of the mind; hospitals of the soul; theme parks of the imagination. On a cold, rainy island, they are the only sheltered public spaces where you are not a consumer, but a citizen, instead. … A mall—the shops—are places where your money makes the wealthy wealthier. But a library is where the wealthy's taxes pay for you to become a little more extraordinary, instead.\nAdvertisement\nAcross the United States, librarians have been experimenting with ways of expanding on this newly elaborated mission—for instance, by opening so-called “maker spaces” in annexes and areas where bookshelves have been cleared out. A throwback to the mechanic’s library of the 19th century, maker spaces collect old and new technologies, from sewing machines to 3-D printers, and encourage patrons to develop and share skills that cannot be practiced over the Internet. \nA trend-setting maker space called the Fab Lab at Fayetteville Public Library, in New York.\nPhoto courtesy Fayetteville Free Library FabLab\nSome look askance at the library morphing into a bookless social club for gearheads and gadget nerds.\nFor those who might look askance at the prospect of their library morphing into a bookless social club for gearheads and gadget nerds, a group of young arts-oriented librarians have formed the Library as Incubator Project to promote a different, though by no means incompatible, vision of “third place.” On its website, the Library as Incubator Project highlights library programs from around the country that involve displaying, facilitating, or disseminating art, often by and for the local community. Favorite projects include the Local Music Project at the Iowa City Public Library, where librarians lease recordings from local artists and offer them online to cardholders for free, and the Brooklyn Art Library’s Sketchbook Project , a traveling bookmobile that accumulates donated 32-page sketchbooks from both professional and amateur artists and displays them around the country. It’s easy to imagine how a local institution built on these sorts of programs could continue to serve as hospital of the soul and theme park of the imagination long after all the paper books have been cleared away.\nThe Idea Box at Oak Park, Ill. public library—a rotating interactive exhibition and artist residency space.\nPhoto courtesy of Oak Park Public Library/Flickr\nBoth maker spaces and Library as Incubator–style art programs engage library patrons to produce their own content. Also in this vein, some wealthier libraries have begun hosting self-publishing and print-on-demand technologies like the Espresso Book Machine . If basic Internet access is no longer anything to write home about, it’s notable that the cutting-edge technologies that libraries can boast of providing on-site access to are used more for creating and less for passive, traditional library activities like reading and watching.\nOn a broader scale, the recently-launched Digital Public Library of America , operating out of the Boston Public Library, is building a nationwide digital collection of historical materials sourced everywhere from libraries and private collections to family photo albums and boxes of old letters in the attic. According to founder Dan Cohen, the DPLA’s ambition is to work with local libraries to collect materials and perhaps eventually to present them at touch-screens designed to help patrons explore the history of their specific communities. “We love the idea of making a connection between the digital and physical realm,” Cohen says.\nAdvertisement\nHere, the new emphasis on user-generated content overlaps with one of the longtime pillars of the library ideal, going back to Alexandria—a comprehensive archive of human knowledge, imagination, wisdom, and experience. The local library, the community’s traditional point of contact with that vast archive, becomes a place where we not only download culture, but upload it too.\nAs cash-strapped public libraries scramble to reorient themselves for the digital age around access to technology and “third place” services, better-funded university libraries have been steadily pushing ahead with the same set of revamped ideals writ large. A few bold new constructions, like the James B. Hunt, Jr. Library at North Carolina State University, reflect widespread confidence that universities will always have a place for libraries as service desks, collaboration spaces, and technology access points. \nThe Hunt, completed in early 2013, stores the vast majority of its book collection in a compact system of metal bins accessed by book-fetching robots. Similar systems are used by companies like Walmart at distribution centers. The robots work 24 hours a day and can retrieve a book ordered from a computer or mobile device in two to five minutes. On display to the public upon entering the building, the robots have become a museum-like attraction, drawing not just curious engineering students but also children, who get a kick out of pushing a button and spurring the robots into action.\nThe rest of the library is an experiment in what to do with an abundance of space and a mandate for technology and collaboration. Many walls and even furniture pieces can be written on, illustrating the library’s transition away from a mood of hushed reverence. In addition to loud rooms and quiet rooms, the Hunt features several spaces that offer to the entire campus community specialized technology that might in other circumstances be available only to a certain academic program. “We find that people in other disciplines will use the technology differently, extend it,” says university librarian Susan Nutter.\nStudents in front of the robotic book storage system at NC State’s Hunt Library.\nPhoto courtesy Jeff Goldberg/Esto\nAdvertisement\nFor example, the Hunt’s four visualization labs allow students and professors to share MicroTiles screens to collaborate on complicated projects that require looking at multiple images, documents, videos, or websites side-by-side. These labs attracted the attention of the campus ROTC chapter, which is training students in warship steering simulations, and the local video game industry, which has formed new research collaborations with professors on campus. \nStudents explore traffic simulations at a teaching and visualization lab at NC State.\nPhoto courtesy Marc Hall/NC State University\nThe high-tech future of libraries might lie in buildings like the Hunt, but walk into a typical American public library and you’ll probably identify about three current core services: storing an underused circulating collection of paper books, ensuring community-wide access to Facebook on desktop computers, and sheltering homeless people.\nAs at the New York Public Library, the books are making a quiet last stand against the techno-historical forces pushing them aside. It seems unlikely they’ll hold onto their real estate for very long. The desktops are, for now, essential for a significant but shrinking slice of the population—mostly poor and elderly people—who can’t reliably access the Internet from home or on a mobile device. Eventually, the Venn diagram of those who lack smartphones and those who lack homes may nearly overlap exactly. Libraries are well positioned to serve many of the needs of this demographic, the dispossessed of the digital age. \nLibrary interior.\nPhoto courtesy Bradleyolin/Flickr\nPatching the gaps of the fraying social safety net with shelter, bathrooms, and other very basic services for people in crisis is not part of the original mission of public libraries. It can detract from other services, particularly those aimed at children. Perhaps for this reason, a library in Orange County, Calif., recently instituted a napping and odor ban .\nHowever, public libraries have long served a progressive, interventionist agenda, putting knowledge directly into the hands of the poor, the immigrant, and those historically excluded from certain educational institutions. If no better resources can be cobbled together, isn’t it against the spirit of the library to turn away a person in need? It remains to be seen how this commitment will affect middle-class willingness to fund public libraries.\nThe Gramsci Monument Library at the Forest Houses, in the Bronx, 2013.\nPhoto courtesy Jason Eppink/Flickr\nOutside of the publicly financed system, the library-as-intervention model thrives in fringy endeavors like books-to-prisons projects, the Occupy Wall Street library, or the Little Free Library ’s outdoor book-sharing boxes. It’s a good time to operate one of these outsider libraries, which are particularly well positioned to make use of the vast detritus of unwanted paper books currently washing up every day at Goodwill stores and recycling centers. \nIt remains uncertain exactly what will happen to the New York Public Library’s Main Branch in the renovations already underway. Supposedly forthcoming is a plan that will preserve the Snead stacks as part of a new circulating library, allowing patrons to see and experience the historic stack design, which has been off-limits to visitors up until now. This plan should satisfy preservationists, if not scholars hoping to keep the research collection intact. If it carries the day, the stacks will have survived less as a functional element of city infrastructure and more as a museum curiosity for tablet-toting patrons of the future.\nBut perhaps it’s in the model of the museum that nostalgic and futurist visions of libraries converge. Just as families have begun to visit NC State’s campus to gawk at the book-fetching robots, so tourists of the coming decades might plan trips to 42nd Street to walk the venerable stacks that once served as intellectual aquifer to a great city in its era of cultural blossoming.\nSince Alexandria, we’ve gone to libraries look backward, to give our focused, undivided attention to the wisdom and imagination of the past. This ethic, bound up for centuries in the symbol of the book, can be a kind of intervention in itself, particularly in the current era of constant distraction and multitasking. A library of the future might also be, at its best, a sanctuary where we are encouraged to spend entire hours looking at just one thing, losing awareness of our phones in our pockets, our messages that have to be checked, the thousands of informational tasks that we set for ourselves every day. The book-oriented library, where it survives in defiance of the digital shift, tends to take on the aspect of a temple for this sort of focused, old-fashioned study and contemplation.\nFor instance, Book Mountain , a recently completed library in the Netherlands, proudly emphasizes paper books. It abuts a 42-unit development of residential homes, the so-called “ Library Quarter ”—a sort of mission town for a “cathedral of the mind.” \nBook Mountain in Spijkenisse, the Netherlands, by MVRVD.\nPhoto courtesy Daria Scagliola/MVRDV\nThese days, of course, cathedrals aren’t in much better shape than libraries. To maintain a monumental institution in the middle of a community requires patronage, in both the financial and civic engagement senses. If the people want emerging technologies more than they want books, libraries have to respond to that, even if it means closing up shop and moving entirely online.\nMatthew Battles, who since publishing his history of libraries has become a principal at Harvard’s forward-looking metaLAB , believes that the future of libraries must be decided not by nostalgic scholars or librarians hoping to save their jobs, but in conversation with communities. “Librarians, scholars, policy makers all have to be part of that dialogue, but it must embrace a civic context, not the institutional context,” he says. “If you do that, having spent a lot of time in libraries and meetings with library administration, you end up in this conversation of how do you save the library. People say, ‘We know we have to change, but we don’t know how.’ There’s a death spiral in that dialogue.”\nLibraries will only survive if the communities they serve want and need them to.\nIn the 1990s, the Egyptian government under Hosni Mubarak decided to rebuild the famous library of Alexandria. The Bibliotheca Alexandrina, a monumental design by the Norwegian firm Snøhetta, was completed in 2002 at a cost of about $220 million. Despite the obvious echo of the past, it is in many ways a library of the future. In partnership with the Internet Archive, it features an offline backup of every website since 1996 —an early stab at long-term preservation of online materials. It is also a hub for projects digitizing early Arabic and ancient Egyptian archives.  \nFrom the start, however, the Bibliotheca has been plagued by funding problems. Its book collection has never rivaled those of other major national libraries, and, perhaps due to its Latin name, the institution has had trouble earning the trust of its own country. During the recent political upheavals, dissidents physically attacked the executive floor of the library. The director was investigated for corruption, and the library it lost its endowment. More recently, a tweeted photo of a library gift shop covered in broken glass accused demonstrators of firing bullets at the Bibliotheca and injuring security staff. \nHistory can repeat itself. Libraries will only survive if the communities they serve want and need them to. It would be a tragedy of historic proportions if, for instance, the public library system that Carnegie endowed and inspired is dismantled in the coming decades, but it’s a real possibility. In the end, it’s up to us—scholars, makers, and artists, seekers of community, access, and safe haven, and above all, readers in the old, human sense of the word—to rise to the level of these monuments we’ve built.\nBibliotheca Alexandrina.\nPhoto courtesy Ting Chen/Flickr\nCorrection, April 30, 2014: This article originally misstated that the original plan for the New York Public Library's main branch proposed moving all of the research collection to New Jersey.

                "Giant is the English word (coined 1297) commonly used for the monsters of human appearance but prodigious size and strength common in the mythology and legends of many different cultures. The word giant was derived from the gigantes (Greek: γίγαντες ) of Greek mythology.\n\nIn various Indo-European mythologies, gigantic peoples are featured as primeval creatures associated with chaos and the wild nature, and they are frequently in conflict with the gods, be they Olympian, Celtic, Hindu or Norse. Giants also often play similar roles in the mythologies and folklore of other, non Indo-European peoples, such as in the Nartian traditions.\n\nThere are also accounts of giants in the Old Testament, most famously Goliath, Og King of Bashan, the Nephilim, the Anakim, and the giants of Egypt mentioned in 1 Chronicles 11:23. Attributed to them are extraordinary strength and physical proportions.\n\nFairy tales such as \"Jack the Giant Killer\" have formed the modern perception of giants as stupid and violent monsters, sometimes said to eat humans, especially children (though this is actually a confusion with ogres, which are distinctly cannibalistic). The ogre in \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" is often described as a giant. In some more recent portrayals, like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl, some giants are both intelligent and friendly.\n\nReligious literature and beliefs\n\nAbrahamic mythology\n\n tells of the Nephilim before and after the Flood. According to , the Nephilim were destroyed in the Flood, but Nephilim are reported after the Flood, including:\n* the Anakites ()\n* the Emites ()\n* the Amorites () \n* the Rephaites ()\n\nThe Bible also tells of Gog and Magog, who later entered into European folklore, and of the famous battle between David and the Philistine giant Goliath. The 1st-century historian Flavius Josephus, and the 1st-2nd-century BC Dead Sea Scrolls give Goliath's height as \"four cubits and a span,\" approximately 2.00 m or about six feet seven inches.   The King James translation of the Bible reports the giant Goliath as \"six cubits and a span\" in height—about nine feet nine inches tall, (over 2.75 m) ( KJV), but the Septuagint, a Greek Bible, gives Goliath's height as \"four cubits and a span\" (~2.00 m). See also Gibborim.\n\nJewish historian Flavius Josephus also described the Amorites as giants in his Antiquities of the Jews, circa 93 AD, indicating that fossil evidence still remained at that time:  \"For which reason they removed their camp to Hebron; and when they had taken it, they slew all the inhabitants. There were till then left the race of giants, who had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to the sight, and terrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to this very day, unlike to any credible relations of other men.\" \n\nIn Islam, giants known as jababirat or jabbirun such as Jalut (Goliath) are mentioned, as well as ‘Uj ibn Anaq.\n\nThe Book of Enoch describes giants as the offspring of fallen angels and mortal women in 7:2. \n\nIn Jainism\n\nAccording to Jains, there was a time when giants walked upon this earth.  Jain cosmology divides worldly cycle of time into two parts or half-cycles, avasarpani (age of descending purity) and ascending (utsarpani).\n\nAccording to Jain texts, the height of Rishabha, first tirthankara of present half cycle of time (avasarpani) was 500 dhanusa (longbow).\nIn avasarpani, as the cycle moves ahead, height of all humans and animals decreases. The following table depicts the six aras of avasarpini-\n\nHindu mythology\n\nIn Hinduism, the giants are called Daityas. The Daityas (दैत्य) were the children of Diti and the sage Kashyapa who fought against the gods or Devas because they were jealous of their Deva half-brothers. Since Daityas were a power-seeking race, they sometimes allied with other races having similar ideology namely Danavas and Asuras. Daityas along with Danavas and Asuras are sometimes called Rakshasas, the generic term for a demon in Hindu mythology. Some known Daityas include Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. The main antagonist of the Hindu epic Ramayana, Ravana, was a Brahmin from his father's side and a Daitya from his mother's side. His younger brother Kumbhakarna was said to be as tall as a mountain and was quite good natured.\n\nNative American mythologies\n\nAccording to Paiute oral history, the Si-Te-Cah or Sai'i are a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants, the remains of which were allegedly found in 1911 by guano miners in Nevada's Lovelock Cave.  Furthermore, the Paiute creation story tells of \"beautiful giants\" who once lived between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. After giving birth to a disfigured child, the giants treated the child so poorly that the Great Spirit responded by making the land hot and desolate and allowing enemies to conquer the giants. Only two giants survived: Paiute and his wife, both of whose skin became brown from eternally living in the hot desert. \n\nAdrienne Mayor writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book, Legends of the First Americans.  She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However, about a hundred miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears, and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair, pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature, soil, etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red or orange.\n\nGreek mythology\n\nIn Greek mythology the gigantes (γίγαντες) were (according to the poet Hesiod) the children of Uranus (mythology) (Ουρανός) and Gaia (Γαία) (spirits of the sky and the earth) where some depictions had them with snake-like legs. They were involved in a conflict with the Olympian gods called the Gigantomachy (Γιγαντομαχία) when Gaia had them attack Mount Olympus. This battle was eventually settled when the hero Heracles decided to help the Olympians. The Greeks believed some of them, like Enceladus, to lay buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nHerodotus in Book 1, Chapter 68, describes how the Spartans uncovered in Tegea the body of Orestes which was seven cubits long—around 10 feet (3 meters). In his book The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus Plutarch describes how the Athenians uncovered the body of Theseus, which was of more than ordinary size. The kneecaps of Ajax were exactly the size of a discus for the boy's pentathlon, wrote Pausanias. A boy's discus was about twelve centimeters in diameter, while a normal adult patella is around five centimeters, suggesting Ajax may have been around 14 feet (~4.3 meters) tall.\n\nThe Cyclopes, usually children of Gods (Olympians) and nature spirits (nereids, naiads and dryads), are also compared to giants due to their huge size (Polyphemus, son of Poseidon and Thoosa, and nemesis of Odysseus, comes to mind). The Elder Cyclopes were the children of Gaia and Uranus where they later made Zeus' Master Thunderbolt, Poseidon's Trident, and Hades' Helm of Darkness during the Titanomachy.\n\nThe Hekatonkheires are giants that have 100 arms and 50 heads who were also the children of Gaia and Uranus.\n\nOther known giant races in Greek mythology include the six-armed Gegeines, the northern Hyperboreans, and the cannibalistic Laestrygonians.\n\nRoman mythology\n\nSeveral Jupiter-Giant-Columns have been found in Germania Superior. These were crowned with a statue of Jupiter, typically on horseback, defeating or trampling down a Giant, often depicted as a snake. They are restricted to the area of south-western Germany, western Switzerland, French Jura and Alsace.\n\nNorse mythology\n\nIn Norse mythology, the Jotun (jötnar in Old Norse, a cognate with ettin) are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as \"giants\", most are described as being roughly human sized. Some are portrayed as huge, such as frost giants (hrímþursar), fire giants (eldjötnar), and mountain giants (bergrisar).\n\nThe giants are the origin of most of various monsters in Norse mythology (e.g. the Fenrisulfr), and in the eventual battle of Ragnarök the giants will storm Asgard and fight them, until the world is destroyed. Even so, the gods themselves were related to the giants by many marriages, and there are giants such as Ægir, Loki, Mímir, and Skaði, who bear little difference in status to them. The Chief God Odin was the great-grand son of the Giant Ymir.\n\nNorse mythology also holds that the entire world of men was created from the flesh of Ymir, a giant of cosmic proportions, which name is considered by some to share a root with the name Yama of Indo-Iranian mythology.\n\nAn old Icelandic legend says that two night-prowling giants, a man and a woman, were traversing the fjord near Drangey Island with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight, all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant, the name means \"Old Hag\") is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island, but he disappeared long ago.\n\nA bergrisi appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Iceland.\n\nBalt mythology\n\nAccording to Balt legends, the playing of a girl giantess named Neringa on the seashore formed the Curonian Spit (\"neria, nerge, neringia\" means land which is diving up and down like a swimmer). This giant child also appears in other myths (in some of which she is shown as a young strong woman, similar to a female version of the Greek  Heracles). \"Neringa\" is the name of a modern town on the spot.\n\nBulgarian mythology\n\nIn Bulgarian mythology, giants called ispolini inhabited the Earth before modern humans. They lived in the mountains, fed on raw meat and often fought against dragons. Ispolini were afraid of blackberries which posed a danger of tripping and dying, so they offered sacrifices to that plant. \n\nBasque mythology\n\nGiants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living up the hills of the Basque Country. Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old life style and customs in the forest. Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians, like in the legend of San Martin Txiki, while their most outstanding feature is their strength. It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations, hills and ages-old megalithic structures (dolmens, etc.), with similar explanations provided in different spots.\n\nHowever, giants show different variants and forms, they are most frequently referred to as jentilak and mairuak, while as individuals they can be represented as Basajaun ('the lord of the forests'), Sanson (development of the biblical Samson), Errolan (based on the Frankish army general Roland who fell dead at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass) or even Tartalo (a one-eyed giant akin to the Greek Cyclops).\n\nOther European mythology\n\nIn folklore from all over Europe, giants were believed to have built the remains of previous civilizations.  Saxo Grammaticus, for example, argues that giants had to exist, because nothing else would explain the large walls, stone monuments, and statues that we now know were the remains of Roman construction. Similarly, the Old English poem Seafarer speaks of the high stone walls that were the work of giants.  Even natural geologic features such as the massive basalt columns of the Giant's Causeway on the coast of Northern Ireland were attributed to construction by giants.  Giants provided the least complicated explanation for such artifacts.\n\nMedieval romances such as Amadis de Gaula feature giants as antagonists, or, rarely, as allies. This is parodied famously in Cervantes' Don Quixote, when the title character attacks a windmill, believing it to be a giant. This is the source of the phrase tilting at windmills.\n\nTales of combat with giants were a common feature in the folklore of Wales, Scotland and Ireland.  Celtic giants also figure in Breton and Arthurian romances perhaps as a reflection of the Nordic and Slavic mythology that arrived on the boats, and from this source they spread into the heroic tales of Torquato Tasso, Ludovico Ariosto, and their follower Edmund Spenser.  In the small Scottish village of Kinloch Rannoch, a local myth to this effect concerns a local hill that apparently resembles the head, shoulders, and torso of a man, and has therefore been termed 'the sleeping giant'. Apparently the giant will awaken only if a specific musical instrument is played near the hill. Other giants, perhaps descended from earlier Germanic mythology, feature as frequent opponents of Dietrich von Bern in medieval German tales - in later portrayals Dietrich himself and his fellow heroes also became giants.\n\nMany giants in English folklore were noted for their stupidity.   A giant who had quarreled with the Mayor of Shrewsbury went to bury the city with dirt; however, he met a shoemaker, carrying shoes to repair, and the shoemaker convinced the giant that he had worn out all the shoes coming from Shrewsbury, and so it was too far to travel. \n\nOther English stories told of how giants threw stones at each other.  This was used to explain many great stones on the landscape. \n\nGiants figure in a great many fairy tales and folklore stories, such as Jack the Giant Killer, The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body, Nix Nought Nothing, Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon, Young Ronald, and Paul Bunyan. Ogres and trolls are humanoid creatures, sometimes of gigantic stature, that occur in various sorts of European folklore. An example of another, Slavic, folklore giant is Rübezahl, a kind giant from Wendish folklore who lived in the Giant Mountains (nowadays on the Czech-Polish border). Additionally, mythological beings which are not necessarily considered giants in the common sense can be characterized by a giant-like body size, e.g. the Bergmönch, a German mountain spirit. \n\nIn Kalevala, Antero Vipunen is a giant shaman that possesses mighty spells dating to the creation. Epic hero Väinämöinen sets out to learn these spells from him, but Vipunen is buried underground, and when Väinämöinen digs him out, he is accidentally swallowed by Vipunen. Väinämöinen then forces Vipunen to submit and sing the spells out by hammering his insides. An analysis by Martti Haavio is that Vipunen is not physically large, but his familiar animal (astral form) is a whale. The depiction is not found in the majority of Finnish original stories, and most probably originates from the book's compiler Elias Lönnrot. \n\nAlleged fossil evidence\n\nThrough the centuries, certain archaeologists have searched for fossil evidence of a race of giants. Alleged evidence includes:\n* The Giant of Castelnau: Estimated at 11 feet 6 inches (3.5 m) tall. Discovered by the anthropologist Georges Vacher de Lapouge at the Bronze Age cemetery of Castelnau-le-Lez, France in the winter of 1890.  \n* 1894 press accounts mentioned a discovery of bones of human giants unearthed at a prehistoric cemetery at Montpellier, France. Skulls \"28, 31, and 32 inches in circumference\" were reported alongside other bones of gigantic proportions which indicated they belonged to a race of men \"between 10 and 15 feet in height.\" The bones were reportedly sent to the Paris Academy for further study.  \n* The remains of the Si-Te-Cah or Sai'i, a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants, which were allegedly found in 1911 by guano miners in Nevada's Lovelock Cave. However, the size and nature of the fossil remains has been disputed by Adrienne Mayor in the book, Fossil Legends of the First Americans. \n\nNames and tribal origins of giants\n\n* Amorites (Hebrew)\n* Druon Antigoon ( Belgian )\n* Anakim (Hebrew)\n* Basajaun (Basque)\n* Bendigeidfran (Welsh)\n* Buto (Javanese - Indonesia)\n* Cormoran (Cornwall)\n* Cyclopes/Cyclops (Greek)\n* Daidarabotchi (Japan)\n* Daitya (Sanskrit)\n* Fomorians (Gaelic)\n* Gigantes (Greek)\n* Gog (Hebrew)\n* Gogmagog (British)\n* Goliath of Gath (Hebrew)\n* Ispolini (Bulgarian)\n* Jotuns (Norse/Teutonic)\n* Kalevipoeg (Estonian)\n* Magog (Hebrew)\n* Nephilim (Hebrew)\n* Neringa (Lithuania) (Balt)\n* Og of Bashan (Hebrew)\n* Paul Bunyan (USA)\n* Raksasa (Indonesian)\n* Rephaim (Hebrew)\n* Rubezahl (Wends)\n* Toell the Great (Suur Tõll) (Estonia)\n* Si-Te-Cah (Paiute)\n* Teutobochus (Teuton)\n* Titans (Greek)\n* Toell the Great (Estonian)\n* Ysbaddaden (Welsh)\n* Zamzummim (Hebrew)",
                "Argus Panoptes (or Argos) is a 100-eyed giant in Greek mythology.\n\nMythology\n\nArgus Panoptes (), guardian of the heifer-nymph Io and son of Arestor,  was a primordial giant whose epithet, \"Panoptes\", \"all-seeing\", led to his being described with multiple, often one hundred, eyes. The epithet Panoptes was applied to the Titan of the Sun, Helios, and was taken up as an epithet by Zeus, Zeus Panoptes. \"In a way,\" Walter Burkert observes, \"the power and order of Argos the city are embodied in Argos the neatherd, lord of the herd and lord of the land, whose name itself is the name of the land.\" \n\nThe epithet Panoptes, reflecting his mythic role, set by Hera as a very effective watchman of Io, was described in a fragment of a lost poem Aigimios, attributed to Hesiod: \n\nIn the 5th century and later, Argus' wakeful alertness was explained for an increasingly literal culture as his having so many eyes that only a few of the eyes would sleep at a time: there were always eyes still awake. In the 2nd century AD Pausanias noted at Argos, in the temple of Zeus Larissaios, an archaic image of Zeus with a third eye in the center of his forehead, allegedly Priam's Zeus Herkeios purloined from Troy.  \n\nArgus was Hera's servant. His great service to the Olympian pantheon was to slay the chthonic serpent-legged monster Echidna as she slept in her cave.  Hera's defining task for Argus was to guard the white heifer Io from Zeus, keeping her chained to the sacred olive tree at the Argive Heraion.  She charged him to \"Tether this cow safely to an olive-tree at Nemea\". Hera knew that the heifer was in reality Io, one of the many nymphs Zeus was coupling with to establish a new order. To free Io, Zeus had Argus slain by Hermes. The messenger of the Olympian gods, disguised as a shepherd, first put all of Argus' eyes asleep with spoken charms, then slew him by hitting him with a stone, the first stain of bloodshed among the new generation of gods. \n\nThe sacrifice of Argus liberated Io and allowed her to wander the earth, although tormented by a gadfly sent by Hera.\n\nAccording to Ovid, to commemorate her faithful watchman, Hera had the hundred eyes of Argus preserved forever, in a peacock's tail.  \n\nThe myth makes the closest connection of Argus, the neatherd, with the bull. In the  Library of pseudo-Apollodorus, \"Argos killed the bull that ravaged Arcadia, then clothed himself in its skin.\" \n\nIn popular culture\n\n* In the Harry Potter book and film series, Argus Filch is the name of the excessively-vigilant caretaker at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft. Considering his intricate knowledge of the many secret passages and his obsession with watching students for signs of rule-breaking, his name is likely a reference to Argus Panoptes.\n* A devil beast based on Argos, romanticized as Algoth, appears in the anime series The Devil Lady who uses Jun's fear of being watched to torment her. He ends up killing himself upon entering a fun house mirror room, terrified of being watched himself. \n* The fifteenth colossus from the video game Shadow of the Colossus is called Argus and nicknamed \"The Sentinel\" and \"Vigilant Guard\". The hundreds of eyes carved into the temple that he resides in refers to the omnividence (all-seeing ability) of Argus Panoptes and the watchful colossus himself.\n* Argus Panoptes served as the inspiration for one of the Kaijin from Kamen Rider Wizard, the Phantom Argos\n* In the novel Luka and the Fire of Life, by Salman Rushdie, Argus Panoptes is one of the five appointed guardians of the 'Fire of Life'.\n* Argus Panoptes was featured in Marvel Comics. He was revived by Hera to be in charge of the Panopticon (a computer surveillance system that was set up to help defend New Olympus).\n* A song by the alternative band Ween is named \"The Argus\".\n* A.R.G.U.S. appears in DC Comics as a secretive agency with ties to Homeland Security that is involved in covert operations around the world and is known to monitor and study various kinds of superhuman activities.\n* In the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, Argus works at Camp Half-Blood.  He is said to have eyes all over his body and even his tongue.  He is usually seen driving demigods into Manhattan.\n* Argus (spelled Argos) appears in the 2007 video game God of War: Betrayal. He is the multi-eyed giant pet of the goddess Hera that was sent by the gods to stop main character Kratos' rampage across Greece, but is slain by an unknown assassin in an attempt to frame Kratos for the murder.\n* In Halo 5: Guardians, Spartan Linda-058 uses a MJOLNIR armor named after Argus (ARGUS-class Mjolnir); the armor features multiple types of optical equipment attached to it.\n\nNotes",
                "The peafowl include two Asiatic bird species (the blue or Indian peafowl originally of India and Sri Lanka and the green peafowl of Myanmar, Indochina, and Java) and one African species (the Congo peafowl native only to the Congo Basin) of bird in the genera Pavo and Afropavo of the Phasianidae family, the pheasants and their allies, known for the male's piercing call and, among the Asiatic species, his extravagant eye-spotted tail covert feathers which he displays as part of a courtship ritual. The term peacock is properly reserved for the male; the female is known as a peahen, and the immature offspring are sometimes called peachicks. \n\nThe functions of the elaborate iridescent colouration and large \"train\" of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by sexual selection. More recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap theory that these features acted as honest signals of the males' fitness, since less fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.\n\nPlumage\n\nThe Indian peacock has iridescent blue and green plumage. The peacock \"tail\", known as a \"train\", consists not of tail quill feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. Both sexes of all species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.\n\nThe green peafowl differs from the Indian peafowl in that the male has green and gold plumage with black wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike the Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, only having shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence.\n\nThe Congo peacock male does not display his covert feathers, but uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than those of the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown.\n\nChicks of both sexes in all the species are cryptically coloured. They vary between yellow and tawny, usually with patches of darker brown or light tan and \"dirty white\" ivory.\n\nOccasionally, peafowl appear with white plumage. Although albino peafowl do exist, this is quite rare and almost all white peafowl are not, in fact, albinos; they have a different condition called leucism which causes an overall reduction in different types of pigment. This can result in the complete lack of colouration of their plumage, however preserving normal eye colour. By contrast, true albino peafowl have a complete lack of melanin, resulting in the albino's characteristic red or pink eyes. Leucistic peachicks are born yellow and become fully white as they mature.\n\nIridescence\n\nAs with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colours are not primarily pigments, but structural colouration. Optical interference Bragg reflections based on regular, periodic nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like components) of the feathers produce the peacock's colours. Slight changes to the spacing of these barbules result in different colours. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by the periodic structure and the other is created by a Fabry–Pérot interference peak from reflections from the outer and inner boundaries. Such structural coloration causes the iridescence of the peacock's hues. Interference effects depend on light angle rather than actual pigments. \n\nEvolution and sexual selection\n\nCharles Darwin first theorised in On the Origin of Species that the peafowl's plumage had evolved through sexual selection. This idea was expanded upon in his second book, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex.\n\nSexual selection is the ability of male and female organisms to exert selective forces on each other with regard to mating activity.  The strongest driver of sexual selection is gamete size. In general, eggs are bigger than sperm and females produce fewer gametes than males. This leads to eggs being a bigger investment, and therefore to females being choosy about the traits that will be passed on to her offspring by males. The peahen's reproductive success and the likelihood of survival of her chicks is partly dependent on the genotype of the mate.  Females generally have more to lose when mating with an inferior male due to her gametes being more costly than the male's.\n\nFemale choice\n\nMultiple hypotheses attempt to explain the evolution of female choice. Some of these suggest direct benefits to females, such as protection, shelter, or nuptial gifts that sway the female's choice of mate. Another hypothesis is that females choose mates with good genes. Males with more exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, such as bigger, brighter peacock trains, tend to have better genes in the peahen's eyes.  These better genes will directly benefit her offspring, as well as her fitness and reproductive success. Runaway selection also seeks to clarify the evolution of the peacock's train. In runaway sexual selection, linked genes in males and females code for sexually dimorphic traits in males, and preference for those traits in females.  The close spatial association of alleles for loci involved in the train in males, and for preference for more exuberant trains in females, on the chromosome (linkage disequilibrium) causes a positive feedback loop that exaggerates both the male traits and the female preferences. Another hypothesis is sensory bias, in which females have a preference for a trait in a non-mating context that becomes transferred to mating. Multiple causality for the evolution of female choice is also possible.\n\nWork concerning female behaviour in many species of animals has sought to confirm Darwin's basic idea of female preference for males with certain characteristics as a major force in the evolution of species.  Females have often been shown to distinguish small differences among potential mates, and to prefer mating with individuals bearing the most exaggerated characters.  In some cases, those males have been shown to be more healthy and vigorous, suggesting that the ornaments serve as markers indicating the males' abilities to survive and, thus, their genetic qualities.\n\nThe peacock's train and iridescent plumage are perhaps the best-known example of traits believed to have arisen through sexual selection, though with some controversy.  Male peafowl erect their trains to form a shimmering fan in their display to females. Marion Petrie tested whether or not these displays signalled a male's genetic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in southern England. The number of eyespots in the train predicted a male's mating success. She was able to manipulate this success by cutting the eyespots off some of the males' tails:  females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to untrimmed ones. Males with fewer eyespots, and thus with lower mating success, suffered from greater predation.  She allowed females to mate with males with differing numbers of eyespots, and reared the offspring in a communal incubator to control for differences in maternal care. Chicks fathered by more ornamented males weighed more than those fathered by less ornamented males, an attribute generally associated with better survival rate in birds. These chicks were released into the park and recaptured one year later. Those with heavily ornamented feathers were better able to avoid predators and survive in natural conditions. Thus, Petrie's work has shown correlations between tail ornamentation, mating success, and increased survival ability in both the ornamented males and their offspring.\n\nFurthermore, peafowl and their sexual characteristics have been used in the discussion of the causes for sexual traits. Amotz Zahavi used the excessive tail plumes of male peafowls as evidence for his \"Handicap Principle\".  Since these trains are likely to be deleterious to the survival of an individual (as the brilliant plumes are visible to predators and the longer plumes make escape from danger more difficult), Zahavi argued that only the fittest males could survive the handicap of a large train. Thus, a brilliant train serves as an honest indicator for females that these highly ornamented males are good at surviving for other reasons, and are therefore preferable mates.  This theory may be contrasted with Ronald Fisher's theory (and Darwin's hypothesis) that male sexual traits are the result of initially arbitrary aesthetic selection by females.\n\nIn contrast to Petrie's findings, a seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging peafowl concluded that female peafowl do not select mates solely on the basis of their trains. Mariko Takahashi found no evidence that peahens preferred peacocks with more elaborate trains (such as with more eyespots), a more symmetrical arrangement, or a greater length.  Takahashi determined that the peacock's train was not the universal target of female mate choice, showed little variance across male populations, and did not correlate with male physiological condition. Adeline Loyau and her colleagues responded that alternative and possibly central explanations for these results had been overlooked.  They concluded that female choice might indeed vary in different ecological conditions.\n\nFood courtship theory\n\nMerle Jacobs' food-courtship theory states that peahens are attracted to peacocks for the resemblance of their eye spots to blue berries. \n\nNatural selection\n\nIt has been suggested that a peacock's train, loud call, and fearless behaviour have been formed by natural selection (not sexual selection), and served as an aposematic display to intimidate predators and rivals. \n\nPlumage colours as attractants\n\nA peacock's copulation success rate depends on the colours of his eyespots (ocelli) and the angle at which they are displayed. A study by Roslyn Dakin and Robert Montgomerie showed that the angle at which the ocelli were displayed during courtship was a more important factor in a peahen's choice of males than train size or number of ocelli.\n\nAn experiment by Jessica L. Yorzinski studied the eye movements of peahens while they chose with which mate to copulate. The peahens shifted their gaze from the peacock's display, to their surrounding environment, to different parts of a peacock's train during his display. The lower train is usually evaluated during close-up courtship, while the upper train is more of a long-distance attraction signal. Actions such as train rattling and wing shaking also kept the peahens' attention. This suggests that males have evolved a variety of different display components to increase the chance of winning a female's attention. The peahen's cognitive progress and selective attention thus appear to play an essential role in sexual selection. \n\nRedundant signal hypothesis\n\nAlthough an intricate display catches a peahen's attention, the redundant signal hypothesis also plays a crucial role in keeping this attention on the peacock's display. The redundant signal hypothesis explains that whilst each signal that a male projects is about the same quality, the addition of multiple signals enhances the reliability of that mate. This idea also suggests that the success of multiple signalling is not only due to the repetitiveness of the signal, but also of multiple receivers of the signal. In the peacock species, males congregate a communal display during breeding season and the peahens observe. Peacocks first defend their territory through intra-sexual behaviour, defending their areas from intruders. They fight for areas within the congregation to display a strong front for the peahens. Central positions are usually taken by older, dominant males, which influences mating success. Certain morphological and behavioural traits come in to play during inter and intra-sexual selection, which include train length for territory acquisition and visual and vocal displays involved in mate choice by peahens. \n\nVocalization\n\nIn courtship, vocalisation stands to be a primary way for peacocks to attract peahens. Some studies suggest that the intricacy of the \"song\" produced by displaying peacocks proved to be impressive to peafowl. Singing in peacocks usually occurs just before, just after, or sometimes during copulation. Alerting other males of mating may reduce interference or synchronise breeding times. \n\nBehaviour\n\nPeafowl are forest birds that nest on the ground, but roost in trees. They are terrestrial feeders. All species of peafowl are believed to be polygamous.  In common with other members of the Galliformes, the males possess metatarsal spurs or \"thorns\" on their legs used during intraspecific territorial fights.\n\nDiet\n\nPeafowl are omnivores and eat most plant parts, flower petals, seed heads, insects and other arthropods, reptiles, and amphibians. Wild peafowl look for their food scratching around in leaf litter either early in the morning or at dusk. They retreat to the shade and security of the woods for the hottest portion of the day. These birds are not picky and will eat almost anything they can fit in their beak and digest. They actively hunt insects like ants, crickets and termites; millipedes; and other arthropods and small mammals. \n\nDomesticated peafowl may also eat bread and cracked grain such as oats and corn, cheese, cooked rice and sometimes cat food. It is noticed by keepers that Peafowl love protein rich food including larvae that infest granaries, different kinds of meat, as well as vegetables including dark leafy greens, broccoli, carrots, beans, beets, and peas. They also relish many fruits. \n\nCultural significance\n\nIn Hindu culture, the peacock is the mount of the Lord Kartikeya, the god of war. A demon king, Surapadman, was split into two by Karthikeya and the merciful lord converted the two parts as an integral part of himself, one becoming a peacock (his mount) and another a rooster adorning his flag. The peacock displays the divine shape of Omkara when it spreads its magnificent plumes into a full-blown circular form. Peacock feathers also adorn the crest of Lord Krishna, an avatar of Lord Vishnu, one of the trimurti.\n\nAncient Greeks believed that the flesh of peafowl did not decay after death, so it became a symbol of immortality. This symbolism was adopted by early Christianity, thus many early Christian paintings and mosaics show the peacock. The peacock is still used in the Easter season, especially in the east.  The 'eyes' in the peacock's tail feathers symbolise the all-seeing Christian God and – in some interpretations – the Church. A peacock drinking from a vase is used as a symbol of a Christian believer drinking from the waters of eternal life. The peacock can also symbolise the cosmos if one interprets its tail with its many 'eyes' as the vault of heaven dotted by the sun, moon, and stars. By Christian adoption of old Persian and Babylonian symbolism, in which the peacock was associated with Paradise and the Tree of Life, the bird is again associated with immortality. In Christian iconography, the peacock is often depicted next to the Tree of Life.\n\nThough the peafowl is native to India, in Babylonia and Persia the peacock is seen as a guardian to royalty, and is often seen in engravings upon the thrones of royalty. Nonetheless, using the peacock as the symbol of royalty has an old and distinguished pedigree in India too. The first great dynasty unifying the Indian sub-continent in the 3rd century BCE were known as the \"Maurya\", lit. \"of the peacock\", named after the patriarch Chandragupta Maurya. The word \"Maurya\" is derived from Sanskrit \"Mayura\" (lit. peacock). The monarchy in Iran is referred to as the Peacock Throne. Melek Taus (—Kurdish Tawûsê Melek), the \"Peacock Angel\", is the Yazidi name for the central figure of their faith. The Yazidi consider Tawûsê Melek an emanation of God and a benevolent angel who has redeemed himself from his fall and has become a demiurge who created the cosmos from the cosmic egg. After he repented, he wept for 7,000 years, his tears filling seven jars, which then quenched the fires of hell. In art and sculpture, Tawûsê Melek is depicted as a peacock. However, peacocks are not native to the lands where Tawûsê Melek is worshipped.\n\nIn Hellenistic imagery, the Greek goddess Hera's chariot was pulled by peacocks, birds not known to Greeks before the conquests of Alexander. Alexander's tutor, Aristotle, refers to it as \"the Persian bird\". The peacock motif was revived in the Renaissance iconography that unified Hera and Juno, and on which European painters focused.  One myth states that Hera's servant, the hundred-eyed Argus Panoptes, was instructed to guard the woman-turned-cow, Io. Hera had transformed Io into a cow after learning of Zeus's interest in her. Zeus had the messenger of the gods, Hermes, kill Argus through eternal sleep and free Io. According to Ovid, to commemorate her faithful watchman, Hera had the hundred eyes of Argus preserved forever, in the peacock's tail. \n\nIn 1956, John J. Graham created an abstraction of an 11-feathered peacock logo for American broadcaster NBC. This brightly hued peacock was adopted due to the increase in colour programming. NBC's first colour broadcasts showed only a still frame of the colourful peacock. The emblem made its first on-air appearance on 22 May 1956.  NBC later adopted the slogan \"We're proud as a peacock!\" The current version of the logo debuted in 1986 and has six feather colours (yellow, orange, red, purple, blue, green). On account of the association between NBC and peacocks, it is sometimes nicknamed the \"Peacock Network\". A stylised peacock in full display is the logo for the Pakistan Television Corporation.\n\nIn some cultures, the peacock is also a symbol of pride or vanity, due to the way the bird struts and shows off its plumage.\n\nGastronomy\n\nDuring the Medieval period, various types of fowl were consumed as food, with the poorer populations (such as serfs) consuming more common birds, such as chicken. However, the more wealthy gentry were privileged to less usual foods, such as swan, and even peafowl were consumed. On a king's table, a peacock would be for ostentatious display as much as for culinary consumption. \n\nPeacock is one of the many delicacies mentioned in the Emerson, Lake and Palmer song Pirates, from their album Works Volume 1.",
                "Hera (,, Greek , Hērā, equivalently , Hērē, in Ionic and Homer) is the wife and one of three sisters of Zeus in the Olympian pantheon of Greek mythology and religion. Her chief function was as the goddess of women and marriage. Her counterpart in the religion of ancient Rome was Juno.Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia, The Book People, Haydock, 1995, p. 215. The cow, lion and the peacock were considered sacred to her. Hera's mother is Rhea and her father Cronus.\n\nPortrayed as majestic and solemn, often enthroned, and crowned with the polos (a high cylindrical crown worn by several of the Great Goddesses), Hera may bear a pomegranate in her hand, emblem of fertile blood and death and a substitute for the narcotic capsule of the opium poppy.  Scholar of Greek mythology Walter Burkert writes in Greek Religion, \"Nevertheless, there are memories of an earlier aniconic representation, as a pillar in Argos and as a plank in Samos.\" \n\nHera was known for her jealous and vengeful nature against Zeus' lovers and offspring, but also against mortals who crossed her, such as Pelias. Paris also earned Hera's hatred by choosing Aphrodite as the most beautiful goddess.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name of Hera admits a variety of mutually exclusive etymologies; one possibility is to connect it with Greek ὥρα hōra, season, and to interpret it as ripe for marriage and according to Plato ἐρατή eratē, \"beloved\"  as Zeus is said to have married her for love.  According to Plutarch, Hera was an allegorical name and an anagram of aēr (ἀήρ, \"air\").  So begins the section on Hera in Walter Burkert's Greek Religion.   In a note, he records other scholars' arguments \"for the meaning Mistress as a feminine to Heros, Master.\" John Chadwick, a decipherer of Linear B, remarks \"her name may be connected with hērōs, ἥρως, 'hero', but that is no help, since it too is etymologically obscure.\"  A. J. van Windekens,  offers \"young cow, heifer\", which is consonant with Hera's common epithet βοῶπις (boōpis, \"cow-eyed\"). R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin.  Her name is attested in Mycenaean Greek written in the Linear B syllabic script as , e-ra, appearing on tablets found in Pylos and Thebes. \n\nCult\n\nHera may have been the first to whom the Greeks dedicated an enclosed roofed temple sanctuary,  at Samos about 800 BCE. It was replaced later by the Heraion, one of the largest Greek temples anywhere (Greek altars were in front of the temples, under the open sky). There were many temples built on this site so evidence is somewhat confusing and archaeological dates are uncertain.\n\nWe know that the temple created by the Rhoecus sculptors and architects was destroyed between 570-560 BCE. This was replaced by the Polycratean  temple 540-530 BCE. In one of these temples we see a forest of 155 columns. There is also no evidence of tiles on this temple suggesting either the temple was never finished or that the temple was open to the sky.\n\nEarlier sanctuaries, whose dedication to Hera is less secure, were of the Mycenaean type called \"house sanctuaries\".   Samos excavations have revealed votive offerings, many of them late 8th and 7th centuries BCE, which show that Hera at Samos was not merely a local Greek goddess of the Aegean: the museum there contains figures of gods and suppliants and other votive offerings from Armenia, Babylon, Iran, Assyria, Egypt, testimony to the reputation which this sanctuary of Hera enjoyed and to the large influx of pilgrims. Compared to this mighty goddess, who also possessed the earliest temple at Olympia and two of the great fifth and sixth century temples of Paestum, the termagant of Homer and the myths is an \"almost...comic figure\" according to Burkert. \n\nThough greatest and earliest free-standing temple to Hera was the Heraion of Samos, in the Greek mainland Hera was especially worshipped as \"Argive Hera\" (Hera Argeia) at her sanctuary that stood between the former Mycenaean city-states of Argos and Mycenae,  where the festivals in her honor called Heraia  were celebrated.  \"The three cities I love best,\" the ox-eyed Queen of Heaven declares (Iliad, book iv) \"are Argos, Sparta and Mycenae of the broad streets.\"  There were also temples to Hera in Olympia, Corinth, Tiryns, Perachora  and the sacred island of Delos. In Magna Graecia, two Doric temples to Hera were constructed at Paestum, about 550 BCE and about 450 BCE. One of them, long called the Temple of Poseidon  was identified in the 1950s as a second temple there of Hera. \n\nIn Euboea the festival of the Great Daedala, sacred to Hera, was celebrated on a sixty-year cycle.\n\nHera's importance in the early archaic period is attested by the large building projects undertaken in her honor. The temples of Hera in the two main centers of her cult, the Heraion of Samos and the Heraion of Argos in the Argolid, were the very earliest monumental Greek temples constructed, in the 8th century BCE.\n\nImportance\n\nAccording to Walter Burkert, both Hera and Demeter have many characteristic attributes of Pre-Greek Great Goddesses. \n\nAccording to the Homeric Hymn III to Delian Apollo, Hera detained Eileithyia to already prevent Leto from going into labor with Artemis and Apollo, since the father was Zeus. The other goddesses present at the birthing on Delos sent Iris to bring her. As she stepped upon the island, the divine birth began. In the myth of the birth of Heracles, it is Hera herself who sits at the door instead, delaying the birth of Heracles until her protégé, Eurystheus, had been born first.\n\nThe Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo  makes the monster Typhaon the offspring of archaic Hera in her Minoan form, produced out of herself, like a monstrous version of Hephaestus, and whelped in a cave in Cilicia.  She gave the creature to Python to raise.\n\nIn the Temple of Hera at Olympia, Hera's seated cult figure was older than the warrior figure of Zeus that accompanied it. Homer expressed her relationship with Zeus delicately in the Iliad, in which she declares to Zeus, \"I am Cronus' eldest daughter, and am honourable not on this ground only, but also because I am your wife, and you are king of the gods.\"[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2199 The Iliad by Homer - Project Gutenberg]  Though Zeus is often called Zeus Heraios 'Zeus, (consort) of Hera', Homer's treatment of Hera is less than respectful, and in late anecdotal versions of the myths (see below) she appeared to spend most of her time plotting revenge on the nymphs seduced by her consort, for Hera upheld all the old right rules of Hellene society and sorority.\n\nMatriarchy\n\nThere has been considerable scholarship, reaching back to Johann Jakob Bachofen in the mid-nineteenth century,  about the possibility that Hera, whose early importance in Greek religion is firmly established, was originally the goddess of a matriarchal people, presumably inhabiting Greece before the Hellenes. In this view, her activity as goddess of marriage established the patriarchal bond of her own subordination: her resistance to the conquests of Zeus is rendered as Hera's \"jealousy\", the main theme of literary anecdotes that undercut her ancient cult. \n\nHowever, it remains a controversial claim that primitive matriarchy existed in Greece or elsewhere. \n\nYouth\n\nHera was most known as the matron goddess, Hera Teleia; but she presided over weddings as well.  In myth and cult, fragmentary references and archaic practices remain of the sacred marriage of Hera and Zeus,  and at Plataea, there was a sculpture of Hera seated as a bride by Callimachus, as well as the matronly standing Hera. \n\nHera was also worshipped as a virgin: there was a tradition in Stymphalia in Arcadia that there had been a triple shrine to Hera the Girl (Παις [Pais]), the Adult Woman (Τελεια [Teleia]), and the Separated (Χήρη [Chḗrē] 'Widowed' or 'Divorced').   In the region around Argos, the temple of Hera in Hermione near Argos was to Hera the Virgin.  At the spring of Kanathos, close to Nauplia, Hera renewed her virginity annually, in rites that were not to be spoken of (arrheton).  The Female figure, showing her \"Moon\" over the lake is also appropriate, as Hebe, Hera, and Hecate; new moon, full moon, and old moon in that order and otherwise personified as the Virgin of spring, The Mother of Summer, and the destroying Crone of Autumn.  \n\nEmblems\n\nIn Hellenistic imagery, Hera's chariot was pulled by peacocks, birds not known to Greeks before the conquests of Alexander. Alexander's tutor, Aristotle, refers to it as \"the Persian bird.\" The peacock motif was revived in the Renaissance iconography that unified Hera and Juno, and which European painters focused on.  A bird that had been associated with Hera on an archaic level, where most of the Aegean goddesses were associated with \"their\" bird, was the cuckoo, which appears in mythic fragments concerning the first wooing of a virginal Hera by Zeus.\n\nHer archaic association was primarily with cattle, as a Cow Goddess, who was especially venerated in \"cattle-rich\" Euboea.  On Cyprus, very early archaeological sites contain bull skulls that have been adapted for use as masks (see Bull (mythology)).  Her familiar Homeric epithet Boôpis, is always translated \"cow-eyed\". In this respect, Hera bears some resemblance to the Ancient Egyptian deity Hathor, a maternal goddess associated with cattle.\n\nEpithets\n\nHera bore several epithets in the mythological tradition, including:\n* Αἰγοφάγος (Aigophágos) 'Goat-Eater' (among the Lacedaemonians )\n* Ἀκραῖα (Akráia) '(She) of the Heights' \n*  (Ammonia)\n* Ἀργεία (Argéia) '(She) of Argos'\n* Βασίλεια (Basíleia) 'Queen'\n* Βουναία (Bounáia) '(She) of the Mound' (in Corinth  )\n* Βοῶπις (Boṓpis) 'Cow-Eyed'  or 'Cow-Faced'\n* Λευκώλενος (Leukṓlenos) 'White-Armed'\n* Παῖς (Pais) 'Child' (in her role as virgin)\n* Παρθένος (Parthénos) 'Virgin'\n* Τελεία (Teléia) (as goddess of marriage)\n* Χήρη (Chḗrē) 'Widowed'\n\nChildren and Zeus\n\nHera presides over the right arrangements of the marriage and is the archetype of the union in the marriage bed, but she is not notable as a mother. The legitimate offspring of her union with Zeus are Ares (the god of war), Hebe (the goddess of youth), Eris (the goddess of discord) and Eileithyia (goddess of childbirth). Enyo, a war goddess responsible with the destruction of cities and attendant of Ares, is also mentioned as a daughter of Zeus and Hera, though Homer equates her with Eris. Hera was jealous of Zeus' giving birth to Athena without recourse to her (actually with Metis), so she gave birth to Hephaestus without him, though in some stories, he is the son of her and Zeus. Hera was then disgusted with Hephaestus' ugliness and threw him from Mount Olympus.  In an alternative version, Hera alone produced Hebe after being impregnated by a head of lettuce  or by beating her hand on the Earth, a solemnizing action for the Greeks.\n\nHephaestus gained revenge against Hera for rejecting him by making her a magical throne which, when she sat on, did not allow her to leave. The other gods begged Hephaestus to return to Olympus to let her go, but he repeatedly refused. Dionysus got him drunk and took him back to Olympus on the back of a mule. Hephaestus released Hera after being given Aphrodite as his wife. \n\nHeracles\n\nHera is the stepmother and enemy of Heracles, who was named \"Hera-famous\"  in her honor; Heracles is the hero who, more than even Perseus, Cadmus or Theseus, introduced the Olympian ways in Greece.  When Alcmene was pregnant with Heracles, Hera tried to prevent the birth from occurring by tying Alcmene's legs in knots.  She was foiled by Galanthis, her servant, who told Hera that she had already delivered the baby.  Hera punished Galanthis by turning her into a weasel.\n\nWhile Heracles was still an infant, Hera sent two serpents to kill him as he lay in his cot. Heracles throttled a single snake in each hand and was found by his nurse playing with their limp bodies as if they were a child's toys. The anecdote  is built upon a representation of the hero gripping a serpent in each hand, precisely as the familiar Minoan snake-handling goddesses had once done. \"The picture of a divine child between two serpents may have been long familiar to the Thebans,  who worshiped the Cabeiri, although not represented as a first exploit of a hero\". \n\nLater she stirred up the Amazons against him when he was on one of his quests.\n\nOne account  of the origin of the Milky Way is that Zeus had tricked Hera into nursing the infant Heracles: discovering who he was, she pulled him from her breast, and a spurt of her milk formed the smear across the sky that can be seen to this day. Unlike any Greeks, the Etruscans instead pictured a full-grown bearded Heracles at Hera's breast: this may refer to his adoption by her when he became an Immortal. He had previously wounded her severely in the breast.\n\nHera assigned Heracles to labor for King Eurystheus at Mycenae. She attempted to make almost each of Heracles' twelve labors more difficult.\n\nWhen he fought the Lernaean Hydra, she sent a crab to bite at his feet in the hopes of distracting him.  When Heracles took the cattle of Geryon, he shot Hera in the right breast with a triple-barbed arrow: the wound was incurable and left her in constant pain, as Dione tells Aphrodite in the Iliad, Book V. Afterwards, Hera sent a gadfly to bite the cattle, irritate them and scatter them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the water level of a river so much that Heracles could not ford the river with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\n\nEurystheus also wanted to sacrifice the Cretan Bull to Hera.  She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles.  The bull was released and wandered to Marathon, becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.\n\nSome myths state that in the end, Heracles befriended Hera by saving her from Porphyrion, a giant who tried to rape her during the Gigantomachy, and that she even gave her daughter Hebe as his bride. Whatever myth-making served to account for an archaic representation of Heracles as \"Hera's man\" it was thought suitable for the builders of the Heraion at Paestum to depict the exploits of Heracles in bas-reliefs. \n\nEcho\n\nAccording to the urbane retelling of myth in Ovid's Metamorphoses,  for a long time, a nymph named Echo had the job of distracting Hera from Zeus' affairs by leading her away and flattering her.  When Hera discovered the deception, she cursed Echo to only repeat the words of others (hence our modern word \"echo\").\n\nLeto and the twins Apollo and Artemis\n\nWhen Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant and that Zeus was the father, she banned Leto from giving birth on terra-firma, or the mainland, or any island at sea. She convinced the nature spirits to prevent Leto from giving birth. Poseidon gave pity to Leto and guided her to the floating island of Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island and Leto was able to give birth to her children on the island. As a gesture of gratitude, Delos was secured with four pillars. The island later became sacred to Apollo. Alternatively, Hera kidnapped Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods bribed Hera with a beautiful necklace nobody could resist and she finally gave in. \n\nEither way, Artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo. Some versions say Artemis helped her mother give birth to Apollo for nine days. Another variation states that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of Ortygia and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo.\n\nSemele and Dionysus\n\nWhen Hera learned that Semele, daughter of Cadmus King of Thebes, was pregnant by Zeus, she disguised herself as Semele's nurse and persuaded the princess to insist that Zeus show himself to her in his true form. When he was compelled to do so, having sworn by Styx    his thunder and lightning destroyed Semele. Zeus took Semele's unborn child, Dionysus and completed its gestation sewn into his own thigh.\n\nIn another version, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus by either Demeter or Persephone. Hera sent her Titans to rip the baby apart, from which he was called Zagreus (\"Torn in Pieces\"). Zeus rescued the heart; or, the heart was saved, variously, by Athena, Rhea, or Demeter.  Zeus used the heart to recreate Dionysus and implant him in the womb of Semele—hence Dionysus became known as \"the twice-born\". Certain versions imply that Zeus gave Semele the heart to eat to impregnate her. Hera tricked Semele into asking Zeus to reveal his true form, which killed her. Dionysus later managed to rescue his mother from the underworld and have her live on Mount Olympus.\n\nSee also Dionysus' birth for other variations.\n\nIo\n\nHera almost caught Zeus with a mistress named Io, a fate avoided by Zeus turning Io into a beautiful white heifer. However, Hera was not completely fooled and demanded that Zeus give her the heifer as a present.\n\nOnce Io was given to Hera, she placed her in the charge of Argus to keep her separated from Zeus. Zeus then commanded Hermes to kill Argus, which he did by lulling all one hundred eyes to sleep. In Ovid's interpolation, when Hera learned of Argus' death, she took his eyes and placed them in the plumage of the peacock, accounting for the eye pattern in its tail.  Hera then sent a gadfly (Greek oistros, compare oestrus) to sting Io as she wandered the earth.  Eventually Io settled in Egypt, where according to Ovid she became the Egyptian goddess Isis.\n\nLamia\n\nLamia was a queen of Libya, whom Zeus loved. Hera turned her into a monster and murdered their children. Or, alternatively, she killed Lamia's children and the grief turned her into a monster. Lamia was cursed with the inability to close her eyes so that she would always obsess over the image of her dead children. Zeus gave her the gift to be able to take her eyes out to rest, and then put them back in. Lamia was envious of other mothers and ate their children.\n\nOther stories involving Hera\n\nGerana\n\nGerana was a queen of the Pygmies who boasted she was more beautiful than Hera. The wrathful goddess turned her into a crane and proclaimed that her bird descendants should wage eternal war on the Pygmy folk.\n\nCydippe\n\nCydippe, a priestess of Hera, was on her way to a festival in the goddess' honor.  The oxen which were to pull her cart were overdue and her sons, Biton and Cleobis, pulled the cart the entire way (45 stadia, 8 kilometers).  Cydippe was impressed with their devotion to her and her goddess and asked Hera to give her children the best gift a god could give a person.  Hera ordained that the brothers would die in their sleep.\n\nThis honor bestowed upon the children was later used by Solon, as a proof while trying to convince Croesus  that it is impossible to judge a person's happiness until they have died a fruitful death after a joyous life. \n\nTiresias\n\nTiresias was a priest of Zeus, and as a young man he encountered two snakes mating and hit them with a stick. He was then transformed into a woman. As a woman, Tiresias became a priestess of Hera, married and had children, including Manto. After seven years as a woman, Tiresias again found mating snakes, struck them with her staff, and became a man once more.\n\nAs a result of his experiences, Zeus and Hera asked him to settle the question of which sex, male or female, experienced more pleasure during intercourse. Zeus claimed it was women; Hera claimed it was men. When Tiresias sided with Zeus, Hera struck him blind.\n\nSince Zeus could not undo what she had done, he gave him the gift of prophecy. An alternative and less commonly told story has it that Tiresias was blinded by Athena after he stumbled onto her bathing naked. His mother, Chariclo, begged her to undo her curse, but Athena could not; she gave him prophecy instead.\n\nChelone\n\nAt the marriage of Zeus and Hera, a nymph named Chelone was disrespectful or refused to attend. Zeus condemned her by turning her into a turtle.\n\nThe Iliad\n\nHera plays a substantial role in The Iliad, appearing in a number of books throughout the epic poem. In accordance with ancient Greek mythology, Hera's hatred towards the Trojans, which was started by Paris' decision that Aphrodite was the most beautiful goddess, is seen as through her support of the Greeks during the war. Throughout the epic Hera makes many attempts to thwart the Trojan army. In books 1 and 2, Hera declares that the Trojans must be destroyed. Hera persuades Athena to aid the Achaeans in battle and she agrees to assist with interfering on their behalf.\n\nLater in book 5, Hera and Athena plot to harm Ares, who had been seen by Diomedes in assisting the Trojans. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly. Hera, Ares' mother, saw Ares' interference and asked Zeus, Ares' father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield. Hera encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares and he threw his spear at the god. Athena drove the spear into Ares' body, and he bellowed in pain and fled to Mt. Olympus, forcing the Trojans to fall back.\n\nIn book 8, Hera tries to persuade Poseidon to disobey Zeus and help the Achaean army. He refuses, saying he doesn’t want to go against Zeus. Determined to intervene in the war, Hera and Athena head to the battlefield. However, seeing the two flee, Zeus sent Iris to intercept them and make them return to Mt. Olympus or face grave consequences. After prolonged fighting, Hera sees Poseidon aiding the Greeks and giving them motivation to keep fighting. Afraid that Zeus might realize what Poseidon is doing, Hera devises a plan to distract Zeus. Hera confronts Aphrodite and asks for assistance in seducing Zeus. After receiving love and desirability, she moves on to ask Hypnos if he will knock Zeus unconscious. Her plan works, and Poseidon has the ability to help the Achaeans without any problems.\n\nIn book 21, Hera continues her interference with the battle as she tells Hephaestus to prevent the river from harming Achilles.  Hephaestus sets the battlefield ablaze, to which to river pleads with Hera that if he stops his attack, he will promise not to help the Trojans. Hephaestus stops his assault and Hera returns to the battlefield where the gods begin to fight amongst themselves.\n\nThe Golden Fleece\n\nHera hated Pelias because he had killed Sidero, his step-grandmother, in one of the goddess's temples.  She later convinced Jason and Medea to kill Pelias.\nThe Golden Fleece was the item that Jason needed to get his mother freed.\n\nThe Metamorphoses\n\nIn Thrace, Hera and Zeus turned King Haemus and Queen Rhodope into mountains,  the Balkan (Haemus Mons) and Rhodope mountain chains respectively, for their hubris in comparing themselves to the gods.\n\nThe Judgment of Paris\n\nAll the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of Achilles). Only Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited. She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, \"for the fairest one\"), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.\n\nThe goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a Trojan prince. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida where Troy was situated, they appeared before Paris to have him choose. The goddesses undressed before him, either at his request or for the sake of winning. Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so they resorted to bribes. Hera offered Paris control over all Asia and Europe, while Athena offered wisdom, fame, and glory in battle, and Aphrodite offered the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was Helen, who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. The other two goddesses were enraged by this and through Helen's abduction by Paris they brought about the Trojan War.\n\nIxion\n\nWhen Zeus had pity on Ixion and brought him to Olympus and introduced him to the gods, instead of being grateful, Ixion grew lustful for Hera. Zeus found out about his intentions and made a cloud in the shape of Hera, and tricked Ixion into coupling with it.  So Ixion was expelled from Olympus and Zeus ordered Hermes to bind Ixion to a winged fiery wheel that was always spinning. Therefore, Ixion was bound to a burning solar wheel for all eternity.\n\nIn popular media\n\n* Hera was played by Honor Blackman in the popular film, Jason and the Argonauts, and by Olivia Williams in its TV remake.\n* Hera has often appeared in the Wonder Woman comic book, sometimes as a patroness of the heroine, sometimes as her enemy.\n* Hera was a near-constant foe for Hercules in several made-for-TV movies and later the television series Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. This version of Hera usually manifested as a pair of disembodied eyes, with peacock feathers for pupils, throughout most of the made-for-TV films. She eventually appeared in human form near the end of the series' run, played by Meg Foster.\n* In the film Hercules by Walt Disney Animation Studios, Hera is voiced by Samantha Eggar. In this version, she is the loving biological mother of Hercules.\n* Hera was featured in the video game God of War III. She was seen as an evil, ungrateful drunk, and was eventually killed by the series protagonist Kratos. Hercules acted as her champion in this game, set after his ascension to Olympus.  \n* Hera is featured in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians and Heroes of Olympus book series, more notably in the first book of the latter series, as a goddess with a certain hatred to all demigods, especially children of Zeus such as Thalia Grace. Cabin 2 at Camp Half-Blood is dedicated to her, but it usually stands empty, as the goddess of marriage has no demigods of her own. Erica Cerra portrayed her in the movie adaptation of the first book.\n\nGenealogy"

                "Second World War, 1939–45 | Australian War Memorial\n/Second World War, 1939-45\nSecond World War, 1939–45\nOn 3 September 1939 Prime Minister Robert Gordon Menzies announced the beginning of Australia's involvement in the Second World War on every national and commercial radio station in Australia.\nAlmost a million Australians, both men and women, served in the Second World War. They fought in campaigns against Germany and Italy in Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa, as well as against Japan in south-east Asia and other parts of the Pacific. The Australian mainland came under direct attack for the first time, as Japanese aircraft bombed towns in north-west Australia and Japanese midget submarines attacked Sydney harbour.\nOn 7 May 1945 the German High Command authorised the signing of an unconditional surrender on all fronts: the war in Europe was over. The surrender was to take effect at midnight on 8–9 May 1945. On 14 August 1945 Japan accepted of the Allied demand for unconditional surrender. For Australia it meant that the Second World War was finally over.\nThe Royal Australian Navy (RAN) participated in operations against Italy after its entry into the war in June 1940. A few Australians flew in the Battle of Britain in August and September, but the Australian army was not engaged in combat until 1941, when the 6th, 7th, and 9th Divisions joined Allied operations in the Mediterranean and North Africa.\nP01103.005 At sea off Crete in the Mediterranean, 19 July 1940: Italian cruiser Bartolomeo Colleoni under attack from HMAS Sydney near Cape Spada.\nAWM P01103.005\nFollowing early successes against Italian forces, the Australians suffered defeat with the Allies at the hands of the Germans in Greece, Crete, and North Africa. In June and July 1941 Australians participated in the successful Allied invasion of Syria, a mandate of France and the Vichy government. Up to 14,000 Australians held out against repeated German attacks in the Libyan port of Tobruk, where they were besieged between April and August 1941. After being relieved at Tobruk, the 6th and 7th Divisions departed from the Mediterranean theatre for the war against Japan. The 9th Division remained to play an important role in the Allied victory at El Alamein in October 1942 before it also left for the Pacific. By the end of 1942 the only Australians remaining in the Mediterranean theatre were airmen serving either with 3 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) or in the Royal Air Force (RAF).\n069221 North Africa, 6 January 1941: Australian troops advance into Bardia.\nAWM 069221\nJapan entered the war in December 1941 and swiftly achieved a series of victories, resulting in the occupation of most of south-east Asia and large areas of the Pacific by the end of March 1942. Singapore fell in February, with the loss of an entire Australian division. After the bombing of Darwin that same month, all RAN ships in the Mediterranean theatre, as well as the 6th and 7th Divisions, returned to defend Australia. In response to the heightened threat, the Australian government also expanded the army and air force and called for an overhaul of economic, domestic, and industrial policies to give the government special authority to mount a total war effort at home.\nIn March 1942, after the defeat of the Netherlands East Indies, Japan's southward advance began to lose strength, easing fears of an imminent invasion of Australia. Further relief came when the first AIF veterans of the Mediterranean campaigns began to come home, and when the United States assumed responsibility for the country's defence, providing reinforcements and equipment. The threat of invasion receded further as the Allies won a series of decisive battles: in the Coral Sea, at Midway, on Imita Ridge and the Kokoda Trail, and at Milne Bay and Buna.\n026629 Milne Bay, Papua, September 1942: a Bofors gun position manned by the 2/9th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Australian Artillery, at Gili-Gili airfield. In the background a Kittyhawk is about to land.\nAWM 026629\nFurther Allied victories against the Japanese followed in 1943. Australian troops were mainly engaged in land battles in New Guinea, the defeat of the Japanese at Wau, and clearing Japanese soldiers from the Huon peninsula. This was Australia's largest and most complex offensive of the war and was not completed until April 1944. The Australian army also began a new series of campaigns in 1944 against isolated Japanese garrisons stretching from Borneo to Bougainville, involving more Australian troops than at any other time in the war. The first of these campaigns was fought on Bougainville and New Britain, and at Aitape, New Guinea. The final series of campaigns were fought in Borneo in 1945. How necessary these final campaigns were for Allied victory remains the subject of continuing debate. Australian troops were still fighting in Borneo when the war ended in August 1945.\nWhile Australia's major effort from 1942 onwards was directed at defeating Japan, thousands of Australians continued to serve with the RAAF in Europe and the Middle East. Athough more Australian airmen fought against the Japanese, losses among those flying against Germany were far higher. Australians were particularly prominent in Bomber Command's offensive against occupied Europe. Some 3,500 Australians were killed in this campaign, making it the costliest of the war.\nOver 30,000 Australian servicemen were taken prisoner in the Second World War and 39,000 gave their lives. Two-thirds of those taken prisoner were captured by the Japanese during their advance through south-east Asia in the first weeks of 1942. While those who became prisoners of the Germans had a strong chance of returning home at the end of the war, 36 per cent of prisoners of the Japanese died in captivity.\n117022 Singapore Straits Settlements, 19 September 1945: members of 2/18th Australian Infantry Battalion, prisoners of war of the Japanese, in Changi prison.\nAWM 117022\nNurses had gone overseas with the AIF in 1940. However, during the early years of the war women were generally unable to make a significant contribution to the war effort in any official capacity. Labour shortages forced the government to allow women to take a more active role in war work and, in February 1941, the RAAF received cabinet approval to establish the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF). At the same time, the navy also began employing female telegraphists, a breakthrough that eventually led to the establishment of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) in 1942. The Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) was established in October 1941, with the aim of releasing men from certain military duties in base units in Australia for assignment with fighting units overseas. Outside the armed services, the Women's Land Army (WLA) was established to encourage women to work in rural industries. Other women in urban areas took up employment in industries, such as munitions production.\nSources and further reading:\nPeter Dennis et al., The Oxford companion to Australian military history (Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1995)\nGavin Long, The six years war: Australia in the 1939–45 war (Canberra: Australian War Memorial and the Australian Government Publishing Service, 1973)\nJ.

                "Australian Governments 1939-1945\n \n \nDuring the official wartime period, Australia had five prime ministers - Robert Menzies, Arthur Fadden, John Curtin, Frank Forde and Ben Chifley.\nAustralian governments in  the lead-up to war\nIn the federal elections held in October 1937, the United Australia Party (UAP) - Country Party  Coalition Government was returned to office, winning 43 seats in the House of Representatives (27 UAP  and 16 Country Party). The Australian Labor Party (ALP), led by John Curtin, won 29 seats and two seats were won by conservative Independents. In the Senate Labor made gains, winning 16 seats, while the UAP won 3; from July 1938 the Senate had 20 coalition  and 16 ALP Senators. Joseph Lyons, as leader of the UAP, the larger party in the coalition, was Prime Minister. The Deputy Leader of the UAP, Robert Menzies, served as Attorney-General and Minister of Industry while Earle Page led the Country Party.\nOn 20 March 1939 Menzies resigned from the coalition ministry in protest at Cabinet's decision, under pressure from the Country Party, to repeal the pension provisions in the recently passed National Insurance Bill. Menzies was thus a backbencher when less than a month later, on 7 April, Prime Minister Joseph Lyons suddenly died. Lyons had driven from The Lodge in Canberra to Sydney, when he suffered a heart attack, dying in hospital in Sydney on Good Friday.\nDeputy Prime Minister Earle Page formed an interim administration until the UAP, lacking a deputy leader due to Menzies' resignation, could elect a new leader. In the party room meeting of 18 April 1939, Menzies was elected leader of the UAP and two days later in Parliament, Page launched a vitriolic attack on Menzies, giving vent to the years of political hostility and personal bitterness between the two men.\nPage refused to serve in a government headed by Menzies and withdrew the Country Party from the coalition. The new government which took office on 26 April consisted only of UAP members and relied on Country Party support to remain in office.\n \n26 April 1939 to 28 August 1941\nMinority United Australia Party Government\n26 April 1939 to 14 March 1940\nWhen war broke out in September 1939, Robert Menzies was Prime Minister of Australia, heading a minority UAP Government. He had been leader for just over four months when, in a radio broadcast at 9.15 pm on Sunday 3 September, he informed the Australian people that ‘in consequence of a persistence by Germany in her invasion of Poland, Great Britain has declared war upon her, and that, as a result, Australia is also at war’.\nWith the coming of war, Earle Page  offered Country Party support to form a composite government but Menzies refused, unwilling to allow Page a role in the Cabinet. The Country Party elected Archie Cameron as leader soon after but it was not until 14 March 1940 that a UAP-Country Party Coalition Government was formed, after the government had lost a by election to Labor following the resignation of Richard Casey to become Australia’s first ambassador to Washington.  Cameron acceded to Menzies' right to final say over who would hold Cabinet posts.\nUnited Australia Party-Country Party Coalition Government\n14 March 1940 to 28 August 1941\nThe Menzies Coalition Government was seriously weakened  in August 1940 when three senior ministers were amongst those killed when a Royal Australian Air Force plane crashed while approaching Canberra’s airfield. The  ministers, James Fairbairn, Henry Gullett and Geoffrey Street, were strong and loyal supporters of Menzies.\nThe political situation changed dramatically after the federal election held some five weeks later on 21 September. Following the ballot the ALP and the Coalition parties (23 UAP and 13 Country Party) each held 36 seats in the House of Representatives, leaving two Victorian Independents, Alex Wilson and A.W. Coles, holding the balance of power. In the Senate, the UAP and Country Party won 16 Senate seats and Labor won 3; from July 1941 the Senate had 19 government  and 17 Labor Senators.\nMenzies had hoped for a clear decision but the Coalition Government now relied  on the support of the two Independents to remain in office.  ALP leader John Curtin, while supporting the war effort, resisted Menzies' offers to form an all party national government. Menzies was forced to make  compromises in his ministry, with  Earle Page taking on the position of Minister for Commerce. Menzies also reluctantly accepted Curtin's proposal for the establishment of an  Advisory War Council on which Government and Opposition would have equal  representation, and which the Government could inform and consult on all matters  to do with the conduct of the war.\nIn the wake of the federal election, Archie Cameron lost the Country Party leadership and in October 1940,  Arthur Fadden became acting leader, also taking on the role of Treasurer. He was  confirmed as leader of the  Country Party on 12 March the following year.\nMenzies left for London in late January 1941, returning to Australia in May and   Fadden was acting Prime Minister over this four month period. On Menzies return, he found the coalition deep in political intrigue. Under pressure from  his own party  and his coalition partner to resign, he he stood down as Prime Minister and as leader of the UAP on 28 August 1941.  WM Hughes replaced Menzies as UAP leader and a joint UAP-Country Party meeting chose  Arthur Fadden to lead  the Coalition government. Fadden  was sworn in as Prime Minister the next day.\n \n29 August to 7 October 1941\nUnited Australia Party-Country Party Coalition Government\n29 August to 7 October 1941\nThe UAP-Country Party Coalition Government continued in office   with the minority party now providing the leader. Prime Minister Fadden's Government however lasted only 40 days. On 3 October 1941 it was defeated   during the budget debate on a no confidence motion when the two Independents, Wilson and Coles, crossed the floor to vote with Labor. Fadden was unable to retain majority support in the House of Representatives and he advised the Governor-General  that ALP leader John Curtin should be commissioned as Prime Minister.\n \n7 October 1941 - 5 July 1945\nMinority Australian Labor Party Government\n7 October 1941 to 21 August 1943\nCurtin was sworn in as prime minister on 7 October but without a majority in either House of Parliament, though the position was eased a little when the non Labor Speaker and Chairman of Committees in the House of Representatives, W M Nairn (UAP) and JH Prowse (Country Party),  both agreed to remain in those positions.\nHowever, party political matters returned to the forefront in  1943 when the threat of invasion by Japan was significantly diminished.  On June 21 Nairn and Prowse  resigned ahead of a no confidence motion against the Curtin Government.  Aided by Coles’ vote, the Labor Government survived by the narrow margin of  27 votes to 26.\nAustralian Labor Party Government\n21 August 1943 to 5 July 1945\nLabor's position improved  dramatically with the Curtin Government's landslide win in the federal election of 21 August giving Labor 49 seats in the House of Representatives to the Coalition’s 23 (14 UAP and 9 Country Party) and two Independents (Coles and Wilson). In the Senate, the ALP won all 19 Senate seats contested; from 1 July 1944 the ALP had 22 Senate seats to 14 for the Coalition, the first time since the conscription split in 1916 that Labor had controlled both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.\nCurtin's health deteriorated in his last year as prime minister. He suffered a coronary occlusion in November 1944,  resumed official duties in late  January 1945 and was unwell again from late April. While he lived to see the end of the War in Europe, Curtin died on 5 July 1945, some six weeks before the end of the War in the Pacific.   Deputy Leader Francis Forde took over the prime ministership until the ALP Caucus elected Joseph Chifley as leader.\n \n6 July 1945 to 13 July 1945\nAustralian Labor Party Government\n6 July 1945 to 13 July 1945\nFrank Forde was Prime Minister for only eight days,  from 6 July to 13 July 1945, the shortest term for any Australian prime minister."

                "Tennyson on the Isle of Wight\nTennyson on the Isle of Wight\nThe home of the great poet.\nThe Summer House\n \nTennyson on the Isle of Wight\nIn the autumn of 1853, Alfred and Emily Tennyson went house-hunting. Since their marriage in 1850 they had been searching for a home, but, as Emily's journal tells us, all suggestions and recommendations had been followed by disappointments. From March 1851 they lived at Chapel House in Twickenham , where their son, Hallam, was born in August 1852. In October of that year, Tennyson visited Bonchurch in the Isle of Wight. The poet's friend, Richard Monckton Milnes , had published a biography of John Keats in 1848 and it has been suggested that Tennyson's enthusiasm for Keats' poetry had led him to consider settling on the island where Keats had chosen to write. He was told that Farringford House, in the south of the island, near Freshwater, was available for rent from the Seymour family . Tennyson went to look at the house and found a substantial building in the neo-Gothic style fashionable at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\nIt looked 'rather wretched with wet leaves trampled into the lawn' but he liked it enough to suggest that Emily should travel over and give him her opinion. Freshwater was very remote in the 1850s, and, having missed the steamer from Lymington, the Tennysons made the crossing in a rowing boat. Emily was immediately struck by the view from the drawing room window, and they decided that they would rent Farringford, furnished, with an option to purchase.\nTennyson is a poet of landscape. Views and settings were of great importance to him. Born and brought up in the Lincolnshire wolds, he had found little inspiration in any of the places (Epping Forest, Cheltenham, Mornington Crescent) where he had lived after his family's move south from Lincolnshire in 1837. A compulsive walker, he could now climb daily onto High Down (later given the name Tennyson Down), sometimes pulling Emily with him in a small carriage. Surrounded by trees, Farringford had a sizeable estate, reaching down to the sea. Behind the house was a patch of tangled woodland known as the wilderness through which Tennyson opened up the old paths.\nClose by, he built himself a summerhouse where he did much of his writing. The Pre-Raphaelite painter, William Holman Hunt , visiting Farringford in 1858, was delighted by the murals which Tennyson had been painting onto the panes of glass: 'writhing monsters of different sizes and shapes, swirling about as in the deep'. The summerhouse no longer survives, but visitors to Farringford tell of dragons, sea-serpents and kingfishers, appropriate subjects for a poet working on a cycle of Arthurian poems, The Idylls of the King . In another artistic venture, he made carvings of ivy-leaves in apple-tree wood, and terracotta casts from these were placed round the doors of farm cottages on the estate.\nFrom the start the Tennysons were keen gardeners, with Alfred cutting the grass and rolling the lawns. He would not hear of cutting down the trees which guaranteed his seclusion, even though this would have let through more light for his plants. He was to be seen digging and organising flower and vegetable beds in his gardens. 'I hope no one will pluck my wild Irises which I have planted', he wrote, 'if they want flowers there is the kitchen garden - nor break my new laurels etc. whose growth I have watched … I don't quite like children croquetting on that lawn. I have a personal interest in every leaf about it'.\nSome idea of the garden beds, full of flowers, can be seen in the paintings of Helen Allingham (fig. 4 and cat. 9), who illustrated The Homes and Haunts of Tennyson in 1905, after the poet's death.\nTennyson's garden was, as he put it himself, 'careless ordered'. This was an old-fashioned plan rather than the formal style coming into fashion in the 1850s. The natural scheme, with its apparently random shrubs and perennial plants was more like the gardens of today than the set and almost mathematical flower beds of the High Victorian period. At Farringford, as we can tell from Helen Allingham's paintings, flowers were to be found in profusion in the herbaceous borders of the walled garden.\nTennyson's poetry and Emily's journal tell us of their delight in the plants, birds, animals and insects around them. Friends and family related a number of passages from Tennyson's poems to particular aspects of Farringford life. Among them are the references to the cedar tree (cat. 7) and to the white-flowered yucca plant in 'To Ulysses' , a poem addressed to a friend, Gifford Palgrave . Tennyson writes of seeing\nMy cedar green, and there\nMy giant ilex keeping leaf\nWhen frost is keen and days are brief\n- Or marvel how in English air\nMy yucca, which no winter quells\nAlthough the months have scarce begun,\nHas pushed toward our faintest sun\nA spike of half-accomplished bells.\n \nIn 'The Flower' Tennyson writes of the love in idleness, or heartsease, grown from a seed which he had planted himself. It becomes a symbol for ideas (or his own poetry) which people at first dislike and then steal, copy and devalue.\n \nOnce in a golden hour\nI cast to earth a seed.\nUp there came a flower,\nThe people said, a weed.\nTo and fro they went\nThrough my garden-bower,\nCursed me and my flower.\n \nThe flowering yew trees, with the pollen blowing around them like smoke, found their way into two of Tennyson's poems. His son, Hallam, quotes his mother's journal for April 1868: 'There has been a great deal of smoke in the yew-trees this year. One day there was such a cloud that it seemed to be a firein the shrubbery'. Hallam then notes that this was the inspiration for a passage from The Holy Grail , part of the Arthurian cycle. The old monk, Ambrosius, tells Sir Percivale that he has lived in the abbey for fifty years:\n'O brother, I have seen this yew-tree smoke,\nSpring after spring, for half a hundred years'.\nThe Tennyson memorial in Freshwater Church states that he passed his happiest days at Farringford. One indication of this was his insertion of a new poem in In Memoriam . This sequence of poems, making up an elegy for Tennyson's Cambridge friend, Arthur Hallam, was written over many years and finally published in 1850. Its popularity had a part to play in Tennyson's elevation to the position of Poet Laureate in the same year.\nIn poem II of In Memoriam, Tennyson writes of the yew tree, so often found in graveyards, as a symbol of enduring grief. When others trees are flowering in the spring, the yew does not experience a\n'glow' or 'a bloom',\nWho changest not in any gale,\nNor branding summer suns avail\nTo touch thy thousand years of gloom.\nThe experience of Farringford led Tennyson to write a balancing poem which suggests the coming of hope, of relief from the worst effects of sadness. Incorporated into the sequence as number XXXIX, this was written on 1 April 1868 and published in 1869. Tennyson tells us that the yew can also flower,\nwith its 'fruitful cloud and living smoke':\nTo thee too comes the golden hour\nWhen flower is feeling after flower.\nInside the house at Farringford, Tennyson first chose an attic room for his study, but later moved down to the ground floor. A platform was built on the roof so that he could watch the stars. One of the most remarkable sights he witnessed was the passage of a comet in 1858. For a better view of this, Tennyson climbed up onto the down. On the night of the birth of their second son, 16 March 1854, Tennyson saw Mars in the constellation of the Lion. Lionel had been one of the names considered, and the baby was duly given that name.\nAmong the poems written at Farringford was Maud . The extended monologue of a deeply disturbed man, it expresses Tennyson's anger at the Mammonism of the age. The speaker begins with the suicide of his father, who had suffered a financial disaster. He then tells of his love for Maud, the daughter of a neighbour who, he believes, has profited from his own father's fall. There is considerable evidence that the poem refers to a thwarted early relationship between the poet and Rosa Baring, a member of a wealthy family living at Harrington Hall in Lincolnshire . Certain features can, however, be related to the Isle of Wight, including the account of the crashing of the waves onto the shore. Having glimpsed Maud, the speaker stands in his 'own dark garden ground' and hears the sound of the sea:\nListening now to the tide in its broad-flung shipwrecking roar,\nNow to the scream of a maddened beach dragged down by the wave.\nReviewers complained that these lines were exaggerated, but the scientist John Tyndall confirmed that this effect was not uncommon:\nThe pebbles and shingles on the beach are mainly flint, and emit a sharp sound on collision with each other. As the billows break and roll up the beach they carry the shingle along with them, and on their retreat they drag it downwards. Here the collisions of the flint pebbles are innumerable. They blend together in a continuous sound which could not be better described than by the line in 'Maud'.\nMore recently, Richard Hutchings, standing near the site of Tennyson's summer house 'heard the scream of the shingle at Freshwater Bay as it is dragged down by the waves'.\nMaud was not much liked by the critics, but the profits from the volume enabled Tennyson to take up his option to buy the Farringford estate in 1856.Always nervous about money, Tennyson told his brother-in-law: 'We are going to buy this house and little estate here, only I rather shake under the fear of being ruined'.\nOnce they owned Farringford the Tennysons were able to move in their own furniture and to decorate and re-arrange the interior as they wished . One major change came in 1871 when they built a large room for parties and dances with a library above it. The walls of the house slowly filled up with paintings, sculptures and photographs, among them some from the collection of Italian and Flemish old masters amassed by the poet's father.\nMaud ends with the speaker joining up to fight in the Crimean War . The Tennysons had heard the sound of cannon practice from across the Solent before the war began, and they learnt of the progress of hostilities from the newspapers. The famous military disaster, the Charge of the Light Brigade , took place on 25 October 1854, and was reported in The Times on 3 November. William Howard Russell told the full story there on 13 November and this was followed by other eye-witness accounts. On 5 December, on High Down, Tennyson drafted what has become his best-known work: 'in a few minutes, after reading the description in the Times'. The poem was revised over the next two days and then published on 9 December.\nAnother popular poem written in the summerhouse was 'Enoch Arden' . This is a poem of the sea, telling of a seafarer who tries to set up in business for himself, fails, and so undertakes a voyage on a shipwhich is wrecked. Enoch spends years on a desert island, is eventually rescued, and comes home to find his wife, Annie, remarried. He does not make himself known to her, and she only learns the truth of his return after his death. We know that the Pre-Raphaelite sculptor, Thomas Woolner , gave Tennyson the story for 'Enoch Arden'. Tennyson himself told a friend that the original events took place in Suffolk. The 'little port' of the poem could be in Tennyson's own Lincolnshire, but the landscape of the poem, with its 'Long lines of cliff', its 'chasm', its 'narrow cave' and its beach backed by 'a gray down' is not that of the North Sea coast. It is close to the views that Tennyson's would have seen walking in the area around Farringford. Tennyson would tell friends to 'listen to the sound of the sea' in the line 'The league-long roller thundering on the reef', where he describes the incoming tide on Enoch's island. He was capturing the effect of the waves as they crashed onto the coast of the Isle of Wight.\nThere were many visitors to Farringford , among them Prince Albert who arrived in 1856, just as the Tennysons were preparing to decorate the house and move in their furniture. Charmed, he left with a bunch of cowslips, promising to bring Queen Victoria over from Osborne . Regrettably, this never happened, although the poet made several visits to her. One famous visitor who did arrive was Garibaldi, who came in 1864, and planted a Wellingtoniana, a hugely tall fir tree, near the house.\nTennyson writes of it as\nthe waving pine which here\nThe warrior of Caprera set,\nA name that earth will not forget\nTill earth has rolled her latest year -\nOf the friends who visited Farringford from the mainland many stayed in the house while others established themselves at Plumbleys Hotel in Freshwater .\nOne of the earliest was the painter John Everett Millais, who helped the poet to sweep up the leaves and made a drawing of Emily and Hallam Tennyson for Tennyson's 'Dora'. This was among Millais' contributions to Edward Moxon's illustrated edition of Tennyson's Poems, published in 1857.\nTwo other guests invited to the Tennyson's home were the Reverend Frederic Denison Maurice and Mary Boyle . Both were sent poems and these tell us what Tennyson most valued about Farringford. Maurice, who was godfather to Tennyson's son, Hallam, was associated with the trends in the Church of England which were described as Broad Church. A liberal, he was one of the founders of the movement for social reform known as Christian Socialism. Shortly before Tennyson wrote the poem of invitation in January 1854, Maurice had fallen foul of the Council of King's College, London, for his belief that damnation need not be eternal. Tennyson drafted and then cut the lines:\nShould half our churchmen bear a spite\nTo one so loving of the light\nThe bigot needs must bear a spite\nTo priests so faithful to the light.\nTennyson sets out to persuade Maurice to leave the 'noise and smoke of town' for Freshwater, where the poet watches the 'twilight falling brown'. Maurice could enjoy the garden and the delights of a civilised dinner table with 'honest talk and wholesome wine' and no 'scandal'. In a poem written much later, in 1889, Tennyson told Mary Boyle to 'change our dark Queen-city' and her 'realm of sound and smoke' for a clear sky, the call of the cuckoo and 'the elm tree's ruddy-hearted blossom-flake . . . fluttering down'.\nLocal friends were of great importance in providing stimulation for the poet, who was easily bored and often restless. Fossil hunting was a popular pursuit at the time, and the scientist, Dr Robert Mann, and the rector of Brighstone, Mr Fox, were both happy to instruct him. Other friends began to buy or build houses near Farringford. On expeditions to London, Tennyson often stayed at Little Holland House in Kensington , home of Sara and Thoby Prinsep and a palace of 'high art'. Sara Prinsep was one of the talented and lively Pattle sisters, daughters of James Pattle, an Indian civil servant. The Tennysons knew another of the Pattle sisters, Julia Margaret Cameron , wife of Charles Hay Cameron. The Camerons first rented lodgings in Freshwater in 1857, and then, in 1860, bought two houses and knocked them together to form Dimbola . It was there that Julia Margaret learnt photography, and there are many stories of her pursuit of famous men in the exercise of her art, including, of course, her neighbour and his guests. The Camerons and the Tennysons, parents and children, were constantly visiting each other for more than a decade.\nThrough the Prinseps, Tennyson met the artist, George Frederic Watts , who first painted him in 1858 at Little Holland House, the painter's home for many years. Watts and Tennyson were good friends and, while a guest at Dimbola in 1862, Watts completed a portrait of Emily Tennyson . He then began on another of her husband. Work continued into 1863 on two, almost identical, heads, one, now in the National Portrait Gallery, the other exhibited here from a private collection these show Tennyson surrounded with laurel leaves, a distant glimpse of the white foam on the beach behind him. In 1864, the artist brought his teenage wife Ellen Terry to Farringford.\nWhen the Prinseps were about to lose their home at Little Holland House, Watts commissioned the architect, Philip Webb , to build a house, The Briary, for them all in Freshwater. Watts and his second wife Mary were at The Briary in 1890 while Watts waspainting his last two portraits of Tennyson, Mary Watts writes of seeing her husband and his sitter walking towards the Briary. The poet's Russian wolfhound, Karenina , came first and then 'the poet, a note of black in the midst of vivid green, grand in the foldsof his ample cloak and his face looming grandly from the shadow of his giant hat'\nThe closest of Tennyson's Isle of Wight friends was Sir John Simeon, of Swainston Manor . The two men visited each other regularly, and Tennyson greatly enjoyed Simeon's conversation. More than a year after Simeon died in 1870 he began to write a fine elegy, recalling the day of his friend's funeral. Swainston was famous for its nightingales:\nNightingales sang in his woods:\nThe master was far away:\nNightingales warbled and sang\nOf a passion that lasts but a day;\nStill in the house in his coffin the\nPrince of courtesy lay.\nThe poem which Tennyson hoped would close all volumes of his poetry, 'Crossing the Bar' was written in October 1889 while he was crossing the Solent. He explained to his son the same evening that 'it came in a moment'. Tennyson's gift for natural observation is again apparent, as he tells how the full tide makes no noise and 'seems asleep', almost motionless.\nBut such a tide as moving seems asleep,\nToo full for sound and foam,\nWhen that which drew from out the boundless deep\nTurns again home.\nThe inspiration for 'Crossing the Bar' came as Tennyson returned to Farringford from his summer home at Aldworth, near Haslemere in Surrey. The increasing popularity of the Isle of Wight had resulted in intolerable incursions upon his personal privacy.\nA bridge was built so that he could reach the wilderness and the down without encountering his admirers in the lane, but some particularly insistent tourists, anxious to catch a glimpse of the great man, climbed trees or even walked into the garden. From the late 1860s, the family left the island for the summer months, and it was at Aldworth on October 6 1892 that the poet died. A funeral close to Farringford was considered, but the decision was made to bury Tennyson in Westminster Abbey. However, Emily who died four years later, lies in the Freshwater graveyard. On 6 August 1897, a landmark memorial, a tall stone cross was unveiled on Beacon Down as a monument to the poet laureate.\nLEONEE ORMOND,\nProfessor Emerita of Victorian Studies\nat King's College, London,is the author of\nAlfred Tennyson: A Literary Life\n.",
                "h2g2 - Farringford House, Freshwater, Isle of Wight - Edited Entry\nFarringford House, Freshwater, Isle of Wight Content from the guide to life, the universe and everything\nFarringford House, Freshwater, Isle of Wight\nCreated\n1 Conversation\nFarringford House, the home of Alfred Lord Tennyson for 40 years, is one of the Isle of Wight's hidden treasures. If it was owned by an organisation like the National Trust, its picture would doubtlessly be on every biscuit tin and tea-towel in the UK. Now, though, it is a privately-run hotel all-but-forgotten by all but the few visitors lucky enough to stay there. This is an indescribable shame as it is a perfect relic of the island's pre-eminent Victorian society, second in importance only to Osborne House , Queen Victoria's beloved palace.\nThe Surrounding Area\nFarringford is located on the island's western side, less than three miles from the Needles, and Alum Bay , home of the famous multi-coloured sand cliffs. Farringford is only a few minutes' walk from Compton, Afton and Freshwater Bays, some of the island's award-winning, but quiet, beaches. It is situated just outside of the small, sleepy village of Freshwater, a village whose church, All Saints' Church , dates from the 7th Century. Also nearby is St Agnes's, the island's only thatched church, built on land donated by Tennyson's family from the Farringford estate.\nFarringford is in an area nationally recognised as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Much of the surrounding countryside is owned by the National Trust, including the Needles Old Battery, West High Down, Afton Down, Compton Down, Headon Warren, much of the cliff and coastline, and Tennyson Down itself.\nThe Tennyson Trail, a 15-mile-long footpath running from the Needles to Newport 1 runs by Farringford, and Afton Marshes is also only a few minutes' walk away. All of this means that it is a nature-lover's paradise, surrounded by the finest countryside views in all of England. It was, after all, for this reason that Alfred Lord Tennyson came to live at Farringford.\nDimbola Lodge\nAlthough Farringford itself is not open to the public, a house that was the home of one of Alfred Lord Tennyson's closest friends is. Next door to Farringford is Dimbola Lodge 2 and was the home of Julia Margaret Cameron, the greatest portrait photographer of the 19th Century. In her studio she photographed many of Tennyson's friends and guests.\nDimbola Lodge is interlinked to Farringford as Julia Margaret Cameron was able to record how Farringford House became the focus of a literary and artistic circle of the foremost artists in all mediums of the era. On display are her photographs of Alfred Lord Tennyson and his friends and associates, people such as Charles Darwin 3 , artist GF Watts, who painted several portraits of Tennyson, the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray 4 , who lived on the island, as well as Lewis Carroll 5 , poet Robert Browning, artist William Holman Hunt, artist and thinker John Ruskin, poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Edward Lear 6 and Sir Arthur Sullivan 7 . These give an invaluable insight into the life of Alfred Lord Tennyson and the importance of Farringford as a source of inspiration to many of the most influential men of the 19th Century. 8\nFarringford Before Tennyson\nLittle is known of the history of Farringford before the coming of Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The area was certainly settled in the stone age, as Paleolithic and Neolithic tools and flint implements have been discovered nearby, as well as bronze weapons. The earliest discovery on the grounds of Farringford itself was a hoard of third century coins. The area was certainly important in Saxon times, as the nearby All Saints' Church 9 shows.\nFor much of the Middle Ages the area around Farringford was owned by the Abbey of Lyre and was the site of Prior Manor. In the 14th Century the estate was owned by Walter de Farringford.\nIn 1806 construction of the present house was begun, built as a Georgian house. In 1810 it was enlarged and embellished with Gothic parapets and wood-mullioned casements. Alfred Lord Tennyson described this decoration with the words 'It is like a blank verse, it will suit the humblest cottage and the grandest cathedral. It has more mystery than the classic.'\nBy the 1850s Farringford was owned by the Seymour family.\nAlfred, Lord Tennyson\nAlfred Tennyson 10 was born in Somersby, Lincolnshire on 6 August, 1809, the fourth of twelve children. In 1827 he published his first collection of poems Poems By Two Brothers with his brother Charles 11 Also in 1827 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, although he left in 1831 without a degree.\nTennyson published his first solo volume of poems, Poems, Chiefly Lyrical in 1830, and in 1832 published his second volume, simply entitled Poems. By 1842 Tennyson had won wide acclaim with the publication of his two-volume collection of poems which consisted of a mixture of previously-published poems as well as new work. In 1845 he was awarded a Civil List annual salary of £200. In 1847 he published The Princess, a poem concerning the question of women's rights.\nIn 1850 Tennyson finally married Emily Sarah Sellwood, after a fourteen-year engagement which had begun in 1836 12 . Also in 1850, on William Wordsworth's death, he succeeded as Poet Laureate and moved to Twickenham near London, which he continued to visit each year for the remainder of his life.\nAlfred Lord Tennyson moved to Farringford in 1853. During his time there he wrote many of his most famous works, including The Charge of the Light Brigade and Maud, while another, Crossing The Bar, was written on a voyage between the mainland and his home.\nFrom April 1862, Queen Victoria summoned him to court several times. In 1883 he finally accepted his barony title on Queen Victoria's insistence, having declined the invitation from Prime Ministers Disraeli and Gladstone. He became First Baron Tennyson of Aldworth And Freshwater, and first took his seat in the House of Lords in March 1884. Alfred, Lord Tennyson died on 6 October, 1892 at the age of 83 and is buried in Westminster Abbey.\nTennyson At Farringford\n...Take it and come to the Isle of Wight:\nWhere, far from the noise of smoke and town,\nI watch the twilight falling brown\nAll around a careless ordered garden,\nClose to the ridge of a noble down.\nYou'll have no scandal while you dine,\nBut honest talk and wholesome wine.\nAnd only hear the magpie gossip\nGarrulous under a roof of pine:\nFor groves of pine on either hand,\nTo break the blast of winter stand;\nAnd further on the hoary Channel\nTumbles a billow on chalk and sand.\nThis is how Tennyson described his life at Farringford in a poem to his friend Reverend Maurice in January 1854.\nFinding Farringford\nTennyson first came to the Isle of Wight in 1846 when he came with Edward Moxon to visit James White of Bonchurch. On that occasion he rowed around the Needles, and found the view unforgettable. He returned to the island in 1849, and again in 1853 when he was on the lookout for a house. He heard of Farringford, and fell in love with the view from the drawing room, which persuaded him to make Farringford his home. He summoned his wife Emily from Twickenham. Her diary records her impressions of that fateful trip to see Farringford for the first time;\n'The railway did not go further than Brockhurst then and the steamer, when there was one, from Lymington felt itself in no way bound to wait for the omnibus which brought as many of the passengers as it could from the train. We crossed in a rowing boat. It was a still November evening. One dark heron flew over the Solent backed by a daffodil sky... Next day we went to Farringford and looking from the drawing-room window I thought \"I must have that view,\" and I said so to him when alone.'\nTennyson himself said 'we will go no further, this must be our home.'\nOn 11 November, 1853 Tennyson agreed to rent Farringford, furnished, on a three-year lease for £2 a week 13 . The lease came with an option to buy. On 25 November Alfred and Emily moved in and their staff consisted of a housekeeper, butler, cook, page, lady's maid, parlour and kitchen maids, gardeners, grooms and a coachman. In March 1854 their second son, Lionel, was born in Farringford 14 . By 1856 Alfred, Lord Tennyson's income from his writings was over £2,000 a year and he bought the house, park and farmland of Farringford for £6,900.\nIn the years that followed many of Tennyson's most important poems were written at Farringford. Tennyson also received visits from many of the world's most influential intellectuals. In June 1860 the Tennysons witnessed the eclipse of the sun from Farringford. Garibaldi also planted a Wellingtonia tree on his visit to Farringford in 1864.\nFarringford And Royalty\nOn 13 May, 1856, on the arrival of Tennyson's own furniture, pictures, boxes of books and other assorted ornaments and antiquities, Prince Albert called. Tennyson, flustered in the middle of arranging the unpacking, is reported to have forgotten to offer Prince Albert a chair. Despite this, Albert remained standing, talking pleasantly, and took a bunch of cowslips home for the Queen. Tennyson did not meet Queen Victoria herself until April 1863. Queen Victoria's diary described the event as follows: 'I went down to see Tennyson who is very peculiar-looking, tall, dark.'\nAlfred Lord Tennyson is reported to have been so emotional at the event that his eyes were filled with tears and he could not stand still. He was also unable to remember the Queen's words, and wrote 'I only remember what I said to the Queen - big fool that I was... Why, what an excellent king Prince Albert would have made.' Queen Victoria however was impressed and asked Tennyson to return and bring his family with him. Hallam Tennyson, then ten, wrote 'Observations: You must always say 'mam' when in Her Majesty's presence. You must stand until the Queen asks you to sit down. Her Majesty does not often tell you to sit down...'\nHaunted Farringford\nFew buildings of such historic age and importance escape tales of ghosts and hauntings, and Farringford is no exception. Perhaps through being a hotel, where guests are able to stay overnight within its haunted rooms, the chances of visitors to the site coming across something other-worldly are increased. Or perhaps its inspiring views and gothic appearance encourages the imaginations of those who sleep there to run wild in flights of frightening fancy. Perhaps we will never know for certain, but one thing we do know are the tales that those who stay there have told.\nChief among the tales of Haunted Farringford are those of Emily Tennyson, who is said to have loved life at Farringford so much that she remains there to this day. She is said to haunt the hotel bedroom that was her nursery, looking after and watching any children that stay, and rocking an invisible cradle.\nEmily Tennyson is also supposed to have been seen walking on the lawn, and Alfred Lord Tennyson himself has been reported to have been seen smoking a pipe and relaxing in a chair in the library 15 as well as walking on Tennyson Down, the nearby hill named after him.\nThere are also tales of a phantom horse-drawn carriage seen around the grounds and the road outside Farringford...\nFarringford Today\nFarringford today is a luxury hotel, and has been since the late 1940s. Although this has the disadvantage of meaning that it is not open to the public in the conventional way, it does mean that those lucky enough to stay are perhaps able to appreciate their visit more and savour the atmosphere of living in Farringford, even if only for a short stay, which is something which people who visit a stately home for an hour or two cannot experience.\nThe hotel has sympathetically preserved the fabric of the house, somehow enabling it to be a hotel without spoiling it, and instead embracing the fact that this was Tennyson's home. This is perhaps due to the hotel remaining small - its 19 rooms prevent it seeming like a vast block of flats, and in each room, in the place of the familiar Gideon's Bible, are copies of the works of Tennyson to browse through and enjoy.\nFarringford is set in thirty-three acres of parkland and gardens. The hotel has a nine-hole private golf course, a swimming pool, tennis court, croquet, bowling and putting greens as well as a children's play area. These, and the cheaper accommodation in Farringford's converted stables, are discreet and unobtrusive. A series of 24 chalets, called 'Garden Cottages,' are not quite so successful, but thankfully are positioned out of view of the main house from the drive, and therefore do not spoil the poetic atmosphere which protrudes through a unique building that was a fundamental part of the Victorian Isle of Wight society, and the inspiration for some of the world's greatest poetry.\n1 The island's capital, located in the centre. 2 Dimbola Lodge's vegetarian restaurant was sponsored, until her death, by Linda McCartney, wife of the Beatle Paul 3 The author of Origin of Species said of her work 'I like this photograph better than any other which has been taken of me' 4 Author of several works including Barry Lyndon 5 The author of Alice in Wonderland (real name Reverend Charles Dodgson) who wrote many works including The Hunting Of The Snark while staying at Sandown on the island. 6 Author of nonsense poetry, such as The Owl And The Pussy Cat and the inventor of the limerick 7 Half of the team behind the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas 8 Indeed, even Giuseppe Garibaldi, one of the key men behind the Unification of Italy 1859 - 1870, visited Tennyson at Farringford in 1864. On his introduction to Julia Margaret Cameron, who was covered in photographic chemical stains, his first reaction was that she was a well-dressed beggar. She is reputed to have replied 'This is not dirt but art!' 9 Emily Lady Tennyson's tomb is in the graveyard of All Saints' Church, as is that of Lionel Tennyson, their second son, who was born in Farringford. 10 His name was Alfred Tennyson, 'Lord' was his title (Lord Tennyson) and not his middle name. 11 Although a few poems in the collection were written by another of his brothers, Frederick. 12 The main reason behind this delay was Tennyson's financial instability, made worse after Tennyson lost all his money following the collapse of a woodworking scheme he had invested in. 13 150 years later, in 2003, staying a night in one of the Farringford Hotel's double or twin rooms cost in low season £80 per night and in high season £120 a night, including breakfast. Low season, including dinner, cost £126 a night and high season £166 a night. Staying in the balcony room cost an extra £20 a night, whereas staying in the Tennyson Room cost an extra £14 a night. Tennyson therefore had quite a good deal. 14 Their first son, Hallam, had been born in August 1852, before they moved to Farringford. 15 The library remains a library dedicated to the works of Alfred Lord Tennyson and is sometimes used as a function room as well as for civil marriages.",

                "Tennyson, Alfred Lord Tennyson, English Poet, Victorian Poets, Isle of Wight, English Isles  | Literary Traveler\nExploring the Isle of Wight with Alfred Lord Tennyson\nPosted on January 25, 2012\nBy Ann-Maureen Owens\nThe western tip of England’s Isle of Wight was a setting beloved of the Victorian poet laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson, for the last half of his life. Still beautiful, less populated than the rest of the island and soothingly calm, it is easy to understand his attachment. The poet’s presence lingers at ivy-clad Farringford House, his home near Freshwater Bay for over 40 years, where he entertained artists, intellectuals and royalty. It was operating as a hotel, in a faded grandeur sort of way, when I stumbled upon it a few years ago, a charming place where one is happy just sitting in the garden, admiring the views and soaking in the literary atmosphere.\nTennyson’s origins are found much farther north in the Lincolnshire village of Somersby, but the Isle of Wight captured his heart when he rowed around The Needles, the sharp-edged pillars of chalk that extend out to sea, on a visit there as a bachelor in 1846. By then he was a well-known poet and had been engaged to Emily Sellwood for ten years, but bad financial investments prevented him from marrying until he was named poet laureate after William Wordsworth died in 1850. He returned to West Wight a few years later when he was looking for a suitable family home.\nPoets were the rock stars of the nineteenth century and their work was the stuff of popular culture, so Tennyson found himself hounded by fans in London. He needed a more serene place to work and bring up a family with Emily. They fell in love with Farringford, a secluded Georgian house with gothic windows and beautiful grounds close to a shingled beach, wooded paths and undulating hills. “I must have that view!” Emily reported herself as saying in her diary, and her husband agreed, “We will go no farther, this must be our home.” Such was the power of poetry in those days that the profits generated by one of Tennyson’s long poems, “Maud,” written soon after moving in, enabled them to purchase the estate after renting it for three years.\nQueen Victoria and Prince Albert had also found the Isle of Wight a favourite family retreat and while the Tennyson family was in the midst of moving in and unpacking their furniture, the prince consort dropped by unannounced, chatted pleasantly and left with a bouquet of cowslips from the garden for the queen. It was seven years later that Tennyson was invited to Osborne House to meet Queen Victoria, a moving event in his opinion, though his ten year old son, Hallam, was less impressed, writing in his diary, “You must always say ‘mam’ when in her majesty’s presence. You must stand until the Queen asks you to sit down. Her Majesty does not often tell you to sit down.”\nOn my own journey to West Wight, a contemplative mood began to envelop me as the train left London’s suburbs behind.  A change at Brockenhurst and a bit of a wait to be shuttled back in time on the kind of train that that needs to be opened by reaching through the window to the outside door handle when disembarking, brought me to Lymington Pier. On the ferry across the Solent, I settled in to accept Tennyson’s invitation,\n…Take it and come to the Isle of Wight:\nWhere, far from the noise and smoke of town\nI watch the twilight falling brown\nAll round a careless-order’d garden\nClose to the ridge of a noble down…\nThe “noble down” is now called Tennyson Down, and my first long breezy walk was to the soaring Tennyson monument overlooking an aquamarine sea, white chalk cliffs and sheep-dotted meadows. Tennyson walked this route daily with his dogs and found inspiration for the poems he laboured over in his study or the summerhouse he designed for the garden.\nAs Tennyson’s guests would have done, I relaxed with friends over drinks on the terrace and coffee in the drawing room. We played a round of golf on the small estate course where croquet or bowls would have been on offer in the poet’s time. Garibaldi planted a Wellingtonia tree there in 1864 and Tennyson fashioned an outdoor throne for the Queen of Hawaii’s visit in 1865. The view from the drawing room that so captivated Emily Tennyson draws one out through the garden gate to explore the island on foot.\nA gate at the back of the grounds opens onto a network of paths through woods and fields of National Trust managed land. I followed the poet’s footsteps, noting a footbridge he had built to escape the autograph seekers that eventually found their way to his garden gate, and continued for three miles to The Needles. My return walk brought me past the coloured sand cliffs of Alum Bay and over fields to Warren Farm that serves traditional cream teas of such quality, that this quiet, hidden-away farmhouse kitchen has made the Guardian newspaper’s list of top ten cream tea spots in England. Simple yet luxurious fare in a timeless cottage garden. “Come into the garden, Maud…”\nAnother footpath leads to Dimbola Lodge where Tennyson’s near neighbour, Julia Margaret Cameron, the celebrated Victorian photographer lived. She moved here after visiting her friends, the Tennysons, at Farringdon while her husband and son were away inspecting their coffee plantations. Cameron named it after the family estate in Ceylon and settled into her new hobby, an unusual one for women at the time. She turned a tumble-down greenhouse that had been the chicken coop into her photographic studio and a root cellar into a darkroom. Cameron would often persuade Tennyson’s famous guests to pose for hours, sometimes with costume changes and dramatic settings. Her ”magnum opus” was an edition of Tennyson’s “Idylls of the King” with 24 original photographic images. When Tennyson escorted American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to her door to have a portrait done, he reputedly said, “You will have to do whatever she tells you. I will come back soon and see what is left of you.”\nCameron’s home, situated between Farringford and the bay, was originally two cottages when she bought it in 1860 and ten years later expanded by linking them with a central tower in the fashionable Gothic style. Here, she established a literary and artistic salon, hosting Tennyson, the artist G.F. Watts and his actress bride, Ellen Terry, Charles Darwin, and writers William Makepeace Thackeray, Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, among others. Many years later, her great-niece, Virginia Woolf, affectionately satirized this Victorian circle in her play, “Freshwater,” for their concern with the holiness of Art and their sense of sublimated passion.\nDimbola Lodge is now a photographic museum and gallery featuring Julia Margaret Cameron’s work, including some of her more famous portraits, along with temporary exhibitions by current photographic artists. With a nod to contemporary popular culture, there is a room devoted to the history of the Isle of Wight Pop Festival and a Jimi Hendrix Memorial Garden where his fans can pose with his life-sized statue amid the lavender and roses and then enjoy lunch or afternoon tea in the Cameron Tearoom. Still in evidence is a special gate at the back of Dimbola Lodge that Cameron built for Tennyson, so he could walk through the fields from Farringford to visit, undisturbed by the growing number of day trippers who sought out a glimpse of the poet laureate, as fans do in any era.\nA twenty minute evening stroll inland brought me to the village of Freshwater and through the lych-gate of seventh century All Saints Church. Emily Tennyson is buried in the churchyard, along with sons, Hallam, who eventually became Governor-General of Australia and Lionel, who predeceased his parents after contracting malaria on his way back from India. The poet, who belonged to the nation, rests in London’s Westminster Abbey. Next to the church, The Red Lion, a pub with 11th century origins, keeps pace with the past, brooking no quarter with modern distractions. The establishment prides itself on being so traditional that it discourages cell phone use to the point of insisting the offending customer make a donation to the Lifeboat Charity box. The focus is on real ale and delicious traditional fare such as steak and ale pie or scallops on bubble and squeak, prepared in gourmet fashion. The pub makes no claims to a connection with Tennyson but surely some of his many famous guests must have found it a pleasant diversion.\nTennyson’s home is now being extensively and sensitively restored by its new owners, so it no longer operating as a hotel. I was lucky enough to stay there the summer before it closed in what was once Tennyson’s large and comfortable bedroom with high ceilings, an elaborate fireplace and a view through tall, mullioned windows of the park-like setting and sweeping rose-lined drive. When the restoration is complete, the house will be open to the public for concerts, poetry readings, exhibitions and regular tours. Though no longer a hotel in the strict sense, it will host private functions such as weddings and conferences. Patrons of the restaurant and the self catering cottages tucked out of the way on the 33 acre estate continue to have access to the grounds. The showcase of restored Farringford House is Tennyson’s library where his books, paintings and photographs are displayed.\nThe Isle of Wight has many other attractions such as Queen Victoria’s favourite residence, Osborne House, just outside the famous yachting town of Cowes, and Carisbrooke Castle, where King Charles I was imprisoned, his attempted escape foiled when he got stuck between the window bars. However, as in Tennyson’s day, the chance to escape crowds and enjoy the scenery is its most irresistible charm. Tennyson wrote some of his most famous works here, including “The Charge of the Light Brigade,” while “Crossing the Bar” was written on the ferry between the mainland and his island home. Some believe he and Emily still haunt their beloved Farringford and report apparitions of them in their favourite rooms and walking on Tennyson down. I understand. I also want to go back there.",

The estate remained in the family until 1946 when it was sold to become a hotel.\nAmong the famous visitors to the house were the Prince Consort and Garibaldi, the general who helped unify Italy.\n*Responding to several comments posted on this story, estate director Matthew Slade confirmed the project was entirely privately funded.\nHe added they were committed to ensuring the public would be able to access the restored house, once the project was completed.\nEDITOR'S FOOTNOTE.\nSeveral comments were removed from this story due to offensive or potentially libellous content. Users are asked to please keep in mind our House Rules when commenting on stories.\nThe planning application is due to be discussed at Freshwater Parish Council tomorrow (Tuesday) at 6.45pm, in the Memorial Hall.

                "Isle of Wight: Anyone for Tennyson? - Telegraph\nIsle of Wight: Anyone for Tennyson?\nThe poet's old home on the Isle of Wight makes a fine hotel, says Tiffany Hancock\n12:01AM BST 09 Sep 2003\nOn a cold November evening in 1852, Lord Alfred Tennyson set off for his new home, which he hoped would be \"far from noise and smoke of town\". He stepped into a small open boat with his wife and servants and rowed across the Solent to the Isle of Wight.\nLater that night, he wrote, they arrived at a \"house half hid in the gleaming wood\" where far off in the distance he could hear \"the scream of the madden'd beach dragged down by the waves\". It was not an auspicious beginning.\nMy own arrival at Farringford, Tennyson's old house and now a hotel, was less bleak. A short ferry ride in brilliant sunshine culminated in a 40-minute drive to Freshwater Bay. A little later my car was winding its way up the drive towards an \"ivied house among the pine trees\" with Gothic-style windows and castellated walls. Farringford remains largely unchanged since Tennyson lived there, although his \"careless order'd garden\" now boasts rose beds, a croquet lawn, bowls, tennis courts and a pool.\nInside, the hotel has been careful to retain a Victorian ambience. I was shown to 'Tennyson's Bedroom' complete with peppermint wallpaper, pink velvet chairs, white muslin curtains and watercolours of 19th-century aristocrats. In the centre stood a luxurious four-poster bed so high that it almost needed steps to climb onto.\nThe place is filled with relics and reminders of Tennyson's life. The room next door was once the bedroom of Emily, his wife, and the interconnecting doors are still only lockable from her side. The flat roof where Tennyson star-gazed and the hidden corkscrew staircase to his study - where he would rush to if he heard unwelcome visitors arriving - are unaltered. In his study, where he insisted on smoking his pipes in private for half an hour, morning and evening, his large kneehole bureau and heavy oak chairs remain, now accompanied by a showcase of his cape, pipe, tobacco box and hat.\nDownstairs, the drawing room and terrace command a sweeping view of the undulating down. Although the down is a little changed from Tennyson's day - a row of tall trees now obscures Freshwater Bay - it was this view and his love of the surrounding countryside that largely convinced him to buy Farringford.\nThe area is still a walker's idyll with air that is \"worth sixpence a pint\". I followed 'Tennyson's trail' from Farringford's back-garden gate across the downs to the \"milky steep\" of the cliff-edge with its \"broad-flung ship-wrecking roar\" where his memorial stands today. Tennyson indulged in long, daily walks here - sometimes covering more than 30 miles - murmuring verses and revising them along the way. In later years, he had a wooden bridge built - which is still standing - over the lane to avoid the autograph hunters who gathered at the garden gate.\nHis was not the only well-known name on the island. As Poet Laureate, Tennyson was invited to visit Queen Victoria in East Cowes on numerous occasions. She had bought Osbourne House in 1845 as a refuge from the strain of London life, a place where - in her words - she could \"walk anywhere without being followed or mobbed\".\nNo longer a royal hideaway, the house and grounds are now open to the public and offer a telling insight into the royal couple's marriage.\nYet it is the Durbar room, with its Indian theme, that is most impressive. Built as a tribute to Victoria's reign as Empress of India, every surface is richly embellished, from the deeply coffered ceiling to the sculpted white walls with teak framing. Inside the showcases, the gifts that she was presented with are no less magnificent: ivory workboxes, silver models of Hindu temples and slippers embroidered with golden thread make for a glittering ensemble.\nThe Queen's residence at Osbourne helped make the Isle of Wight fashionable among the cream of Victorian society: Charles Darwin, William Makepeace Thackeray, C. F. Watts and Julia Margaret Cameron, among others, all moved to Freshwater.\nOf these, Tennyson was particularly close to Cameron and made frequent visits to Dimbola Lodge (her home), which is now open to the public. Rumours of an affair remain unquenched; the gate that Cameron had built at the back of her garden so that Tennyson could arrive secretly still stands.\nInside, the lodge is a shrine to the Victorian greats that Cameron photographed. More than 60 images, including pictures of Edward Lear, Henry Taylor, Robert Browning, Lewis Carroll, Darwin, Thackeray, Watts and Tennyson are displayed.\nOne room is devoted to Idylls of the King, a revolutionary project in which she collaborated with Tennyson in illustrating the characters described in his poetry.\nIn later years, after Cameron had emigrated to Ceylon, Tennyson became increasingly frustrated by the number of autograph hunters visiting the island and bought Aldworth in Sussex as a summer escape. Yet Freshwater and many of its characters and surrounding countryside had already inspired much of his poetry. He had spent many happy years here; in his own words,\n\"I once half-crazed for larger light,\nOn broader zones beyond the foam,\nBut chaining fancy now at home,\nAmong the quarried downs of Wight\".\nA half-board two-night stay at Farringford Hotel costs from £162 per person through Wightlink Holidays (0870 582 0202; www.wightlink.co.uk ). Price includes ferry crossings.",

                "The fennec fox or fennec (Vulpes zerda) is a small nocturnal fox found in the Sahara of North Africa. Its most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which also serve to dissipate heat. Its name comes from the Arabic word فنك (fanak), which means fox, and the species name zerda comes from the Greek word xeros which means dry, referring to the fox's habitat.  The fennec is the smallest species of canid. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, desert environments. In addition, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear prey moving underground. It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds.\n\nThe fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity. Its main predators are the African varieties of eagle owl. Families of fennecs dig out dens in sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as 120 sqm and adjoin the dens of other families. Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to information gathered from captive animals. The species is usually assigned to the genus Vulpes; however, this is debated due to differences between the fennec fox and other fox species. The fennec's fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, the animal is considered an exotic pet.\n\nDescription \n\nThe fennec fox weighs about , with a body length of between 24 -; it is around  tall.  It is the smallest species of canid in the world.  The tail has a black tip and is 18 - long, while the ears can be between 10 - long.  \n\nThe coat is often a cream color and fluffy, which deflects heat during the day and keeps the fox warm at night. The fennec's characteristic ears are the largest among all foxes relative to body size, and serve to dissipate heat, as they have many blood vessels close to the skin. The ears of a fennec are sensitive enough to hear prey that may be underground;   the soles of its feet are protected from the hot desert sand by thick fur.\n\nTaxonomy \n\nThe species was previously classified in the genus Fennecus, but has since been reclassified to the genus Vulpes which includes a variety of other types of foxes. Scientists have noted that while there are similarities, there are many differences that set the fennec fox apart from other fox species, including both physical and social traits.  This has led to two conflicting classifications: Vulpes zerda, implying that the fennec fox is a true fox, and Fennecus zerda, implying that the fennec fox belongs to its own genus. \n\nPhysically, the fennec lacks the musk glands of other fox species, and has only 32 chromosome pairs, while other fox species have between 35 and 39.  The species also displays behaviors uncharacteristic of foxes, such as living in packs while most other fox species are solitary.\n\nBehavior \n\nSocial behavior \n\nAn 1876 sketch of a pack of fennec foxes\nInformation on fennec fox social behavior is mainly based on captive animals. The basic social unit is thought to be a mated pair and their offspring, and the young of the previous year are believed to remain in the family even after a new litter is born. Playing behavior is common, including among adults of the species. Fennec foxes make a variety of sounds, including barking, a purring sound similar to that of a domestic cat, and a snarl if threatened. \n\nCaptive animals engage in highly social behavior, typically resting while in contact with each other. Males tend to show more aggression and urine-marking around the time of the females' estrous cycle. They have been seen to bury feces by pushing soil with their noses or hind feet when in captivity. Much remains unknown of their basic ecology and behavior in the wild, and a 2004 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature stated that \"in-depth study of the species, with particular emphasis on habitat use and population dynamics in the wild, is overdue.\"\n\nDiet and hunting \n\nThe fennec fox is an omnivore. Food sources include plants, rodents, insects, birds, eggs, and rabbits.   An individual can jump up to 2 ft high and 4 ft forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators. When hunting, large eared foxes such as the fennec, or the bat-eared fox, can seem to stare at the ground while they rotate their heads from side to side to pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground.  There are reports that fennec foxes climb date palms while foraging for fruit; however, some experts consider these reports unlikely unless low branches are available for support. \n\nThe species is able to live without free water, as its kidneys are adapted to restrict water loss. A fennec's burrowing can cause the formation of dew. They are also known to absorb water through food consumption; but will drink water if available.\n\nReproduction \n\nFennec foxes are social animals that mate for life, with each pair or family controlling their own territory.  Sexual maturity is reached at around nine months old. In the wild, mating usually occurs between January and February for litters to be born between March and April. However, in captivity most litters are born later, between March and July, although births can occur year round.  The species usually breeds only once each year.  The copulation tie has been recorded as lasting up to two hours and 45 minutes.  Following mating, the male becomes very aggressive and protective of the female, providing her with food during her pregnancy and lactation periods.\n\nGestation is usually between 50 and 52 days, although there have been 62 and 63 day gestation periods reported from foxes in captivity. The typical litter is between one and four kits, with weaning taking place at around 61 to 70 days. When born, the kit's ears are folded over and its eyes are closed, with the eyes opening at around ten days and the ears lifting soon afterward. The life span of a fennec fox has been recorded as up to 14 years in captivity.\n\nHabitat \n\nThe species is found in North Africa and Asia. The range is from Morocco through to Egypt, as far south as northern Niger and as far east as the Sinai Peninsula and Kuwait. \n\nA fennec fox's typical den is dug in sand, either in open areas or places sheltered by plants with stable sand dunes considered to be their ideal habitat. In compacted soils, dens can be up to 120 square meters, with up to 15 different entrances. In some cases different families interconnect their dens, or locate them close together. In soft, looser sand, dens tend to be simpler with only one entrance leading to a single chamber.\n\nPopulation \n\nThe fennec fox is classified as \"least concern\" on the IUCN Red List, and as a CITES Appendix II species: species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but whose trade must be controlled to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.   It is often hunted by humans, though it does not cause any direct harm to human interests, such as livestock. Like other foxes, it is prized for its fur by the indigenous people of the Sahara and Sinai. \n\nCurrent statistics on population are not known, but the population is assumed to be adequate based on observations of traders commonly trapping fennec foxes in Northern Africa for exhibition or sale to tourists. In southern Morocco, the fennec fox is commonly seen in sandy areas away from permanent human settlements.\n\nPredators \n\nThe fennec fox's main predators are the various African varieties of eagle owl. Other possible predators include caracals, jackals, striped hyenas, and the saluki, a greyhound-like domestic dog local to the area. However, fennec foxes are considered very difficult to capture, and reports of predators other than the eagle owl are considered to be anecdotal and questionable. \n\nFennec foxes are commonly trapped for sale to the pet trade and for fur by the human population of Northern Africa. In southern Morocco in particular, their meat is not eaten because it is considered to be foul smelling.\n\nAs pets \n\nThe fennec fox is bred commercially as an exotic house pet. Breeders tend to remove the young kits from the mother to hand-rear, as owners prefer tamer and more handleable foxes, thereby making them more expensive.\n\nThe species is classified a \"small wild/exotic canid\" by the United States Department of Agriculture, along with the coyote, dingo, jackal, and Arctic fox,  and is considered the only species of fox, other than the domesticated silver fox, which can properly be kept as a pet. Although it cannot be considered domesticated, it can be kept in a domestic setting similar to dogs or cats.  A breeders' registry has been set up in the United States to avoid any problems associated with inbreeding. The legality of owning a fennec fox varies by jurisdiction, as with many exotic pets.  \n\nCultural depictions \n\nThe fennec fox is the national animal of Algeria.  It also serves as the nickname for the Algeria national football team: \"Les Fennecs\". \n\nFennec is the code name for Mozilla's Firefox for mobile project. \n\nA fennec fox named Finnick was depicted in Disney's Zootopia as a cute animal that turns out to be a smooth operator who is a partner-in-crime to Nick Wilde, the film's secondary protagonist.  As a result of the popularity of the movie, the LA Times reported that Chinese children are begging their parents to procure the animals as pets."

                "Report: Disclosure Simplification\nReport of the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification\nReport of the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification\nMarch 5, 1996\nCapital is the lifeblood of our economy.  By guarding the integrity of our capital markets through full and fair disclosure, the federal securities laws protect investors while at the same time ease the ability for companies to raise funds from the public.\nThese laws, however, are not administered without cost.  We who regulate our nation's financial markets must continuously strive to strike a balance between the benefits and the burdens posed by the rules we promulgate.  For this reason, the SEC periodically reviews areas of its regulatory structure to see how they might be made more efficient and less burdensome.\nIn 1995, we undertook two such reviews.  The Advisory Committee on Capital Formation and Regulatory Processes, ably chaired by Commissioner Steve Wallman, is concluding its work at this writing.  The Committee is examining ways to improve the process for registering securities that are offered in our public markets, including the concept of registering companies as opposed to transactions or offerings of securities.\nThe second review, and the subject of this Report, was that undertaken by the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification.  The Task Force was asked to review rules and forms affecting capital formation, with a view toward streamlining, simplifying, and modernizing the overall regulatory scheme without compromising or diminishing important investor protections.  To balance our internal perspective on these matters, I asked Philip Howard, an outspoken advocate of regulatory common sense, to lend a hand.\nIn a seven-month period, the Task Force reviewed most forms and rules relating to capital-raising transactions; periodic reporting pursuant to the Exchange Act; proxy solicitations; as well as tender offers and beneficial ownership reports under the Williams Act.  Suggestions were sought from interested organizations and hundreds of recommendations were considered.\nThe resulting report offers a regulatory blueprint for corporation finance in the years ahead.  Together with the Commission's continued emphasis on the primacy of investor protection, these common-sense recommendations will help to ensure that ours remain the strongest, most vibrant, transparent, and liquid capital market in the world for many years to come.\nArthur Levitt\nWashington, D.C.  20549\nDear Chairman Levitt:\nSimplifying securities regulation offers unusual challenges because the SEC acts, not just as the regulator of the markets, but as referee.  Market participants are keenly aware of the need for the SEC to maintain a level and orderly playing field, and, in making these recommendations, the Task Force was mindful not to tip the balance among the many market interests.\nLike all agencies, however, the SEC has suffered from the bureaucratic tendency to create ever thicker rule books.  Each complication breeds another level of complexity and, over time, the original regulatory goal becomes obscured amid thousands of words of detailed dictates.  Some SEC rules, intended to guide market participants in daily decisions, have become a kind of Latin liturgy, comprehensible only to those of us who have devoted our professional lives to abstract regulatory nuances.\nThe Task Force began the process of simplification by combing the rule books for duplication and obsolescence.  The resulting recommendations would clean out significant regulatory clutter.  The Task Force then tackled several well-known regulatory problems, and has recommended overhaul of, for example, the format for prospectuses and the regulations governing trading during a distribution, as well as liberalizing rules for capital-raising by smaller companies.\nThe Task Force has sought to present an agenda for simplification that is sensible and achievable in a short period.\nThis effort, however, is only the beginning.  Changing long- established conventions is never easy; our eyesight has difficulty focusing on changes that in future years may seem natural and obvious.  To help focus future reforms, the Task Force has identified anomalies caused by a misfit between statutory precepts born over 60 years ago and the realities of modern global electronic markets.  Overall, the Task Force has sought to set out in a new direction, on a path where a regulatory agency sees its job always to monitor its own performance at the same time that it regulates ours.\nThe few months that the Task Force worked on this project demonstrated how ready all participants are for a fresh\n=======================START OF PAGE 3==\nlook.  The SEC staff members who constituted the Task Force took on the challenge of simplification with enthusiasm and creativity.  I could not commend them more highly.  Many experts and practitioners offered ideas and comments revealing wisdom born of decades of practical experience.  I thank my colleagues at Howard, Darby & Levin, particularly Gus Caywood and Ed Reitler, who were resourceful and helpful to me throughout the project.\nFinally, I thank you for initiating the kind of self- examination that I believe is critical to the effectiveness of this and every government agency.\nYours respectfully,\nPhilip K. Howard.\nAcknowledgements\nThe following is a list of the members of the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification responsible for preparing this Report:\nOffice of the Chairman\nI.

The goal was to simplify the disclosure process and, consistent with investor protection, to make regulation of capital formation more efficient.\nTo aid its review, the Task Force met over a seven-month period with issuing companies, investor groups, underwriters, accounting firms, lawyers and others who participate daily in the capital markets.  These participants helped the Task Force to identify and formulate reforms that reduce costs and regulatory burdens without impairing the transparency and integrity of our capital markets.  None suggested wholesale deregulation, and virtually all emphasized the importance of basic regulatory goals to preserve orderly markets.\nThe recommendations that follow would eliminate or modify many rules and forms, and simplify several key aspects of securities offerings.  Certain recommendations reinforce the Commission's other initiatives to improve the disclosure process, and should be viewed as part of those ongoing efforts.  The recommendations roughly fall into three categories:\nWeeding out forms and regulations that are duplicative of other requirements or have outlived their usefulness;\nRequiring more readable and informative disclosure documents; and\nReducing the cost of securities offerings and increasing access of smaller companies to the securities markets.\nIn addition to specific recommendations, the Task Force has sought to identify anomalies of the regulatory structure.  The basic structure has served the markets well for over 60 years, but should be rethought in the age of novel financial instruments and virtually instantaneous electronic communication and clearance settlement practices.  Re-configuring these regulatory tenets must be done with caution, in order to avoid tipping the balance in favor of certain market participants or jeopardizing investor protection.  But the need for modernization is apparent, and the Task Force has identified areas for Commission review.  Of course, in considering how the Commission would like to proceed with reviewing any of the matters discussed in the Report, the Commission should thoroughly consider the scope of its authority and other related issues.\nA summary of the principal recommendations follows.\nI.  Elimination and Streamlining of Rules and Forms\nThe Task Force recommends eliminating or modernizing many rules relating to disclosure and registration procedures to simplify the rule books and reduce the cumulative burden of compliance.  By eliminating unnecessary detail, these recommendations also should help focus disclosure on issues of importance to investors.  If all of the recommendations are implemented, the Commission would eliminate 81 rules and 22 forms, and modify dozens of others.  In total, the recommendations would eliminate or modify approximately 23 percent of the rules and 54 percent of the forms and schedules reviewed by the Task Force.\nSelected examples of the recommendations are as follows.\nStreamline Accounting Disclosures\nMany accounting rules have become outdated or duplicative of the requirements of \"generally accepted accounting principles,\" resulting in unnecessary complication and expense.  Upon review, the Task Force recommends eliminating 11 accounting rules and 9 staff accounting bulletins.  The Task Force also recommends modifying other accounting rules that appear to be unnecessarily restrictive.\nFor example, some companies awaiting audit of their year-end financial statements have a \"black-out\" period in which they cannot issue new securities.  The Task Force believes this period is unduly restrictive in light of other ongoing disclosure obligations, and recommends retaining the requirement only for initial public offerings.  These and other accounting-related recommendations are discussed more fully under \"Accounting Disclosure Changes.\"\nEliminate Outdated Regulation\nMany rules, while well conceived when initially adopted, have become obsolete.  For example, Regulation B, adopted in 1963 (and substantially revised in 1972), provides an exemption for certain offerings of \"fractional undivided interests\" in oil and gas rights.  Despite its eight pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, the Regulation has fallen largely into disuse as a result of changes in the energy market and the availability of other exemptions.  Another set of obsolete rules was promulgated in the late 1940s to govern securities offerings through\n=======================START OF PAGE 2==\ncompetitive bidding with multiple underwriters.  The rules were adopted largely to accommodate other rules which have themselves already been discarded.  As explained more fully under \"Elimination of Rules and Forms,\" the Task Force recommends that these and similarly outdated rules be eliminated.\nDisclosures required of issuers include numerous outdated or ostensibly immaterial categories.  The Task Force recommends modifying dozens of requirements in virtually every area of corporate finance, from raising dollar thresholds for disclosure in Regulations S-K and S-X to updating industry-specific disclosure requirements in the Industry Guides.\nAnother outdated standard is the requirement that companies disclose government environmental proceedings that may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.   Depending largely on the size of the company, this requirement can result in disclosure that is not material to a particular company.  Therefore, the Task Force proposes that the Commission replace the $100,000 \"one size fits all\" standard with a more flexible general materiality standard, or raise the threshold to a higher dollar amount.  These and other recommendations are discussed more fully under \"Disclosure Generally.\"\nThe Task Force also found unnecessary disclosure burdens in other areas.  One example requires issuers making an exchange offer for the securities of a non-reporting company to provide audited financial statements of such company whether or not audited financials have been provided in the past.  There is no apparent need for requiring the acquiror to provide more financial information about the target to the target's shareholders than the target's shareholders have been provided in the past.  As discussed under \"Significant Corporate Transactions,\" elimination of this requirement would both streamline disclosures in exchange offer registration statements and reduce the cost of preparing such documents.\nII.   Simplify Disclosure Formats\nA cornerstone of the securities laws is the requirement of full and fair disclosure.  The prospectus -- the traditional offering document -- describes the company and its management and financial condition so that market participants can make an informed judgment about a company and its prospects in deciding whether to buy its securities.  While prospectuses are indispensable sources of information for market professionals and therefore to the market, the reality is that these and other disclosure documents are often written in a manner that has been described as \"turgid,\" \"opaque\" and \"unreadable.\"  Dense writing, with legal boilerplate and repetitive descriptions of the company, has become the standard convention.\n=======================START OF PAGE 3==\nOne reason for this convention appears to be stylistic and formatting habits that have become entrenched by years of practice.  It is undoubtedly easier to copy from previous disclosures than it is to formulate new and more effective ways to communicate with investors.  The Commission's own rules -- for example, requiring certain disclosures to be presented in almost unreadable bold capital letters -- may have contributed to the problem.  Fear of liability by companies and underwriters for omissions also may have created a bias towards repetitive and over-inclusive disclosures, with trivial information sometimes receiving as much attention as material information.\nThe Task Force recommends, as a first step, that the Commission adopt a new format for the opening pages of disclosure documents under the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and tender offer documents under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The Task Force also urges the Commission to continue its plain-English initiatives and make other modifications to the disclosure rules to encourage disclosure that is both concise and more readable.\nFor prospectuses, the Task Force suggests that the dense and uninformative disclosure on cover pages be replaced with easy-to-read disclosure that would summarize important aspects of the offering.  Today, the opening pages of prospectuses are dominated by boilerplate legal disclaimers.  Under the Task Force's idea, the first few pages would answer the more common questions asked by investors, such as a description of the securities (including special features), identification of the issuer and underwriter, an explanation of why funds are needed, the offering price, the securities' trading symbol (if any) and any special characteristics of the offering, including risk factors.  Two illustrations of possible formats are included in \"Presentation of Information.\"\nSimilar problems of readability occur with documents used in extraordinary business transactions such as tender offer documents.  Investors typically receive dense offering and transmittal documents that contain an overwhelming amount of information.  The Task Force recommends that a standardized summary sheet be included on the inside cover of each Offer to Purchase.  An outline of the information required and a sample summary also are included in \"Presentation of Information.\"\nIII.  Reduce the Costs of Securities Offerings\nPermit Delayed Offerings and Simplify Reporting By Smaller     Companies\n=======================START OF PAGE 4==\nOver a decade ago, the Commission significantly streamlined the registration process for certain large publicly-traded issuers with three years of reporting history with the Commission.  By introducing \"shelf registration\" for primary offerings of securities by these issuers, the Commission permitted certain relatively large, seasoned companies to sell some or all of the securities under an already effective registration statement at a time of their own choosing.  In 1992, the Commission reduced the reporting period and market float requirements of Form S-3 and thereby extended the benefits of shelf registration to a wider variety of issuers.  This flexibility allowed such companies to take advantage of perceived \"market windows.\"\nThe Task Force recommends that a modified shelf registration procedure be provided to smaller companies that have filed timely public reports with the Commission for at least 12 months.  This would provide approximately 4,800 companies with greater flexibility with respect to the timing of their offerings.\nThe Task Force also recommends permitting these smaller companies to deliver certain prior periodic reports to prospective investors instead of repeating similar information in the prospectus.  This delivery method, now used by companies filing on Forms S-2/F-2 and reporting for 36 months, saves printing and other costs and results in a streamlined registration statement more focused on the proposed transaction.  The Task Force believes that this delivery method should be expanded to issuers timely reporting for at least 12 months and using Forms S-1/F-1 (which will render Forms S-2/F-2 superfluous).\nThese proposals are discussed in more detail under \"Facilitating Capital-Raising.\"\nExempt Certain Small Local Offerings\nUnder Regulation A, small companies may offer publicly up to five million dollars worth of unregistered securities within a 12-month period by way of a short-form offering circular.  When it created this exemption, the Commission recognized that the costs of registration may otherwise effectively preclude such smaller offerings.  The Task Force recommends that this exemption be liberalized to permit an eligible company to raise five million dollars within each 6-month period, rather than each 12-month period.  This exemption would be of particular assistance to a rapidly growing, small company.\nAnother existing exemption that is advantageous for small businesses permits certain unregistered offerings within the borders of a single state.  The Task Force recommends relaxing the restrictions in the Commission's safe harbor rule, Rule 147,\n=======================START OF PAGE 5==\nto make the exemption more useful to smaller companies.  In addition, the Task Force recommends that the Commission adopt a \"regional\" exemption for offerings up to five million dollars that cross state lines but remain within a prescribed regional area.  This exemption would permit offerings in a metropolitan area that is not contained within a single state.  A fuller discussion of these proposals is included under \"Small Business Initiatives\".\nSome of these recommendations that affect small business will be of interest to state securities regulators; the Commission should follow its normal practice of coordinating such initiatives with the states.\nSeasoned Issuers\nThe Report includes several recommendations to reduce costs of registration and enhance timing flexibility for larger, more seasoned issuers, such as permitting shelf registrants to register dollar amount of offerings without any description of the securities to be offered and deferring payment of filing fees until the time of the actual offering.  These and similar recommendations are described in \"Facilitating Capital-Raising.\"\nIV.  Simplify Other Regulatory Requirements\nIn addition to the reforms designed to reduce costs of registration, the Task Force has sought to identify rules and requirements that may have unnecessarily affected decisions in the capital-raising process or caused unnecessary compliance costs.\nOverhaul the Rules on Trading During a Securities     Distribution\nFew rules have resulted in more day-to-day effort by securities firms and by Commission staff than the rules regulating purchases by an issuer or underwriter during a securities distribution (Exchange Act Rules 10b-6, 10b-6A, 10b-7, and 10b-8).  Few would take issue with their purpose:  to protect the integrity of the offering process by precluding interested parties from activities influencing the market price for the offered security.  But few, also, would dispute that these \"trading practices rules\" have become unnecessarily complicated and, in many respects, outdated.\nThe Task Force recommends a wholesale revision of the \"trading practices rules\"  with a new regulation that would be narrower in scope and easier to understand and follow.  Among other things, the new rules would establish separate requirements for issuers and other distribution participants, and in the case\n=======================START OF PAGE 6==\nof underwriters and broker-dealers, exempt actively-traded securities, permit a greater range of activities by distribution participants, make an exception for de minimis transactions, and substantially reduce the rule's application to debt securities.  The new regulation also would broaden the opportunities for permissible passive market-making and provide more flexibility for stabilizing transactions.  Finally, the Task Force recommends rescission of Rule 10b-8 entirely, which covers rights offerings.\nThese recommendations are discussed in greater detail under \"Trading Practices Rules.\"\nPlace Exchange Tender Offers on the Same Timetable as Cash Tender Offers\nToday, a cash tender offer can be commenced immediately upon filing appropriate disclosure documents.  A tender offer that includes securities rather than cash, however, must wait until a registration statement relating to the offered securities is filed, possibly reviewed by Commission staff, and declared effective before the offer can be commenced.  The Task Force recommends that most registration statements relating to exchange tender offers filed by seasoned issuers eligible to use the short form registration statements, Forms S-3/F-3, be deemed effective automatically upon filing.  This recommendation, discussed more fully under \"Significant Corporate Transactions,\" would place such exchange tender offers on the same footing as cash tender offers.  Just as with the current practice involving cash tender offers, exchange offer registration statements would remain subject to post-effective review by Commission staff.   V.  Securities Act Concepts\nThe statutory framework of the Securities Act, which has served the financial markets well for over 60 years, currently is being reexamined in light of the constant evolution of today's capital markets.  A number of initiatives have been undertaken by the Commission, Congress, state regulators and the private sector to reassess the continuing effectiveness of the Securities Act registration, prospectus delivery and other requirements.\nThe rapidly evolving world in which we live is placing many strains on the system.  Technological developments and globalization, for example, have made securities regulation today quite different from 1933.  Many other strains exist as well.\nA number of approaches to address some or all of the strains currently are being debated.  These include the global alternative of \"company registration\" being considered by the Advisory Committee on the Capital Formation and Regulatory Processes chaired by Commissioner Steven M.H. Wallman, and less\n=======================START OF PAGE 7==\nglobal alternatives, such as narrowing the definition of \"offer,\" which would allow issuers to \"test the waters\" for interest without the cost of full-blown registration; or permitting a \"pink herring\" registration, an alternative to the previous approach, that would require companies to file a simplified registration statement in order to \"test the waters.\"\nPending further consideration of all of the alternatives, the Task Force recommends a quick fix dealing with \"integration\" of private and public offerings to avoid unnecessary frictions for issuers in their capital-raising activities as well as other initiatives for seasoned issuers.\nA discussion of possible alternative approaches, as well as specific recommendations, is included under \"Securities Act Concepts.\"\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *\nThese and many other recommendations are discussed in more detail under the following thirteen tabs:  Elimination of Rules and Forms; Presentation of Information; Securities Act Concepts; Facilitating Capital-Raising; Small Business Initiatives; Significant Corporate Transactions; Registration; Reporting; Disclosure Generally; Trading Practices Rules; Accounting Disclosure Changes; Technical Changes; and Other Current Commission Initiatives.\n=======================START OF PAGE 8==\nI.   ELIMINATION OF RULES AND FORMS\nThis section includes Task Force recommendations that focus on ways to streamline the non-financial disclosure rules.  In some cases, the Task Force recommends eliminating forms or rules that no longer serve a significant purpose, because more recent regulatory initiatives by the Commission have rendered them outdated and superfluous.  In other instances, the Task Force recommends eliminating rules or forms that impose disclosure requirements that are overly burdensome by comparison with the utility of the disclosures elicited.\nA.   SECURITIES ACT REGULATIONS\n1.   Eliminate Regulation B (Rules 300-346), and accompanying Schedules A, B, C, and D, and Forms 1-G and 3-G, which provide a limited exemption for certain interests in oil or gas rights, due to its limited use and the availability of more beneficial exemptions.\nRegulation B provides a conditional, limited exemption from Securities Act registration for offerings of \"fractional undivided interests\" in oil or gas rights of up to $250,000 per offering.  The Commission originally enacted Regulation B in 1963 and last revised it substantially in 1972.\nIn order to obtain the Regulation B exemption, an offeror of fractional undivided interests in certain specified oil or gas rights must file an offering sheet with the Commission at least ten days prior to commencing the offering.  The offering sheet must contain the information specified by Schedules A, B, C, or D, depending on the distinct type of oil/gas interest, as well as on whether the enterprise is producing or non-producing.  These schedules require detailed information concerning the nature and amount of the interests offered; a discussion of the legal rights and obligations created by such interests; a description of the property in question; for producing interests, a history of the oil/gas production activities in the field in question; and, for non-producing interests, a description of plans for the drilling of wells, including the estimated costs and method of financing such drilling.  Regulation B does not require any offeror to furnish current or past financial statements.\nRegulation B also requires an offeror to submit two post- offering reports:  Form 1-G and Form 3-G.  Form 1-G, which is filed with the Commission, requires disclosure of information pertaining to each sale of the offered securities.  Form 3-G, which is sent to each purchaser, as well as filed with the\n=======================START OF PAGE 9==\nCommission, must disclose more detailed information pertaining to the offering's results, including the actual cost of drilling and expenses incurred in the selling effort.\nBetween 1966 and 1977, the Commission received 6,904 Regulation B filings.  This relatively large number of Regulation B filings corresponded with an increase in oil/gas drilling activity and related financing triggered by the energy crisis of the mid-1970s.  In 1975 alone, the Commission received 625 Regulation B offering sheets pertaining to $35.4 million in total sales.\nHowever, by 1977 the number of Regulation B offering sheets filed with the Commission had dropped to 96, covering only $7.3 million in aggregate sales of oil/gas securities.  Since then, the number of Regulation B offering sheets filed has steadily declined, from 94 such filings in 1980, to 13 in 1985, seven in 1990, four in 1992, and, finally, zero in 1995.  Moreover, since enactment of Regulation B's reporting requirements in 1972, the Commission has received only one each of Form 1-G and Form 3-G.\nThe decrease in submissions may be due to a decrease in small scale oil/gas ventures occurring in the United States since the end of the 1970s energy crisis, as well as the availability of other exemptions, such as the limited offering exemptions from registration set forth in Regulation D, or the private placement exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.  Of these exemptions, Rule 504 of Regulation D probably offers the most benefits to the small oil or gas issuer.  There are several reasons why such an issuer, which is not an Exchange Act reporting company, would elect to proceed under Rule 504 rather than Regulation B when claiming an exemption for an offering of fractional undivided oil or gas interests.  First, under Rule 504, an offeror can claim an exemption for a maximum amount of securities that is four times greater than that allowed under Regulation B ($1,000,000 compared to $250,000).  Second, the Rule 504 exemption is not conditioned on specific disclosures other than the notice filing of Form D (which the Task Force proposes to eliminate).  Third, while Rule 504 is available for an offering of fractional undivided interests in an oil or gas limited partnership, Regulation B is unavailable for such an offering.\nGiven the current lack of use by small oil/gas financiers of the Regulation B exemption, the availability of a more flexible exemption under Rule 504, and the potential availability of other limited offering exemptions with higher dollar limits, retention of this exemption with its disclosure requirements serves little purpose.  Accordingly, the Task Force recommends the elimination of Regulation B in its entirety, along with the elimination of Schedules A, B, C, and D, and Forms 1-G and 3-G.\n=======================START OF PAGE 10==\n2.   Eliminate Regulation E (Rules 601-610) and accompanying Forms 1-E and 2-E, which relate to a limited exemption for certain types of investment companies designed to aid small businesses, or  incorporate Regulation E within Regulation A.\nRegulation E provides an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for small offerings of securities issued by two types of investment companies:  small business investment companies (\"SBICs\") and business development companies (\"BDCs\").  Regulation E was adopted in 1958, shortly after the enactment of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (\"SBIA\"), and was extended to BDCs in 1984.  Both types of companies were authorized by Congress in order to stimulate the flow of capital to small businesses.\nSBICs were authorized pursuant to the SBIA.  Their activities are limited to investing in small businesses by purchasing securities and making loans.  Such investments are facilitated by the Small Business Administration, which is authorized to license SBICs and to provide or guarantee loans to SBICs at favorable rates.  BDCs are investment companies that are regulated under specific provisions under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"Investment Company Act\").  BDCs must make specific types of investments in small businesses, as well as provide significant managerial assistance to the companies in which they invest.\nRegulation E has been used infrequently.  The Commission has received a total of only 40 Form 1-E filings by 14 investment companies, with all but eight of these filings made prior to 1985 and only one since 1990.  Furthermore, since Regulation E's inception, the Commission has received only four Form 2-E filings.\nThere may be several reasons for Regulation E's limited use.\nFirst, the five million dollar limit on offerings under the Regulation E exemption may tend to discourage its use.  Many SBICs and BDCs may prefer instead to conduct private placements or registered public offerings, which are not subject to this limitation.  Second, Regulation E is available only to those SBICs that are registered investment companies.  Most SBICs, however, elect to avoid registration as investment companies by meeting the exception in Investment Company Act Section 3(c)(1) for any issuer that has fewer than 100 beneficial owners and does not make a public offering.  Unregistered SBICs therefore may not avail themselves of Regulation E even if it were available, since such an offering, if made to the public, may result in the loss of the exemption from Investment Company Act registration.       =======================START OF PAGE 11==\nAnother reason for the disuse of Regulation E may be that the same form that a SBIC must file to register under the Investment Company Act (Form N-5) can also be used by the SBIC to fulfill its Securities Act registration requirements.  Because of the convenience afforded by Form N-5's dual function, a SBIC that intends to register under the Investment Company Act is more likely to register an initial public offering of securities on Form N-5.\nThe Commission's experience with Regulation E suggests that there does not appear to be any need for a small offering exemption for SBICs and BDCs.  Consequently, the Task Force recommends eliminating Regulation E and the two forms that are required to be filed with the Commission in connection with its use, Forms 1-E and 2-E.\nAlternatively, the Task Force recommends that the Commission consider eliminating Regulation E and expanding the Regulation A exemption to include registered SBICs and BDCs.  This approach has two advantages.  First, the Commission could, at the same time, consider ways to make unregistered small offerings more attractive to SBICs and BDCs by, for example, extending Regulation A's $1,500,000 limit for selling securityholder resales to these issuers.  The Task Force's recommendation to amend Regulation A to permit issuers to raise five million dollars during any six month period rather than five million dollars per year also may benefit registered SBICs and BDCs.  Second, while Regulation E differs from Regulation A in certain respects that are attributable to special characteristics of SBICs and BDCs, the Task Force believes that amending Regulation A to accommodate registered SBICs and BDCs would be relatively easy to accomplish.\n3.   Eliminate Regulation F (Rules 651-656) and accompanying Form  1-F, pertaining to a limited exemption for assessments levied on assessable stock and for resales of forfeited assessable stock, because the adoption of Rule 504 has significantly reduced the Regulation's utility.\nRegulation F provides a conditional limited exemption from Securities Act registration for assessments levied on assessable stock and for resales of forfeited assessable stock.  The Commission promulgated Regulation F in 1959 at the same time that it enacted Securities Act Rule 136.  Rule 136(c) defines \"assessable stock\" to mean \"stock which is subject to resale by the issuer in the event of a failure of the holder of such stock to pay any assessment levied thereon.\"  Thus, assessable stock is stock the purchase of which triggers an annual obligation to pay an amount, termed an \"assessment,\" to the      =======================START OF PAGE 12==\nissuer in addition to the original offering price.  If the buyer fails to pay the levied assessment after receiving a notice of delinquency from the issuer, the issuer can reclaim the original stock and resell it, usually at an auction.\nUnder Rule 136, both the levying of an assessment on assessable stock and the resale of forfeited assessable stock constitute the issuance of securities, which trigger registration requirements under the Securities Act.  Regulation F establishes a partial conditional exemption from registration for these transactions.  In order to qualify for the exemption, a company must be incorporated or have its principal business operations in the United States.  In addition, a company cannot claim more than $300,000 in exempted assessable stock transactions for any one calendar year.           A company also must file a Form 1-F with the Commission's regional office closest to its principal business operations at least 10 days prior to levying any claimed exempted assessment or sale of delinquent assessable stock.  Form 1-F requires disclosure of pertinent information about the issuer; its 10 percent beneficial stockholders; its directors and officers; its levied assessments, resales of forfeited assessable stock, and other unregistered securities issued during the preceding year; and its current proposed assessments or resales of forfeited assessable stock.       Historically, only two types of companies have issued assessable stock:  mining companies and water extraction/delivery companies, also known as mutual water companies.  Since the promulgation of Regulation F, approximately 40 such companies have filed a total of 234 1-F forms.  Most of these filings occurred between 1967 and 1982.  Only 32 Form 1-F filings have occurred between 1983 and 1995.  Ten companies were responsible for those filings.  Since 1992, only three companies have filed a total of 10 1-F forms with the Commission.\nThe primary reason for the recent steady decline of Form 1-F filings appears to be the availability of more beneficial limited offering exemptions, particularly the Rule 504 exemption.  Virtually all Regulation F companies have been non-reporting companies eligible to claim a Rule 504 exemption.  In 1982, the Commission adopted its first version of Rule 504.  Following that year, the annual number of Form 1-F submissions steadily decreased from nine in 1982, to six in 1983, three in 1984, zero in 1985 and 1986, and an average filing rate of two to three for the years 1987 to 1995.\nThere are several reasons why an assessable stock issuer would seek to proceed under Rule 504 rather than Regulation F.  First, it would receive a higher annual dollar limit ($1,000,000 compared to $300,000).  Second, Rule 504 posits no informational\n=======================START OF PAGE 13==\nrequirements.  Third, the Rule 504 exemption is available for new issues as well as assessments and sales of forfeited assessable stock.  Therefore, given the lack of filings under Regulation F and the availability of the broader Rule 504 exemption, the Task Force recommends that the Commission eliminate Regulation F in its entirety, along with its accompanying Form 1-F.\nB.   OTHER SECURITIES ACT RULES\n1.   Eliminate Securities Act Rule 148, which sets forth a safe harbor for resales made under the repealed Bankruptcy Act, because the rule has become outdated.\nRule 148 was originally designed to be a counterpart to Rule 144 and to provide a safe harbor for the resales of certain categories of securities acquired in bankruptcy proceedings, including securities issued under the federal Bankruptcy Act, portfolio securities sold under the Securities Investors Protection Act (SIPA), and where the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has been appointed receiver of the debtor's assets.\nIn 1978, the federal Bankruptcy Act was repealed and replaced with the Bankruptcy Code, which provides an exemption from Securities Act registration as well as a safe harbor for the resales of securities received under a plan of reorganization.  Through no-action letters, the Commission has taken the position that Rule 148 is applicable only to resales of securities that were issued under the repealed Bankruptcy Act, and not to resales of securities subject to the new Bankruptcy Code.  Consequently, Rule 148 appears to be outdated and should be eliminated.\n2.   Combine Rules 152a and 236, both of which relate to fractional shares, and adjust the dollar cap under Rule 236 to account for inflation.\nRules 152a and 236 relate to fractional interests.  Rule 152a applies when fractional interests resulting from a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, conversion, merger or similar transaction are combined and sold.  The rule clarifies that the offer and sale of the combined fractional interests is deemed to be a transaction by persons other than an issuer, underwriter or dealer under Section 4(1) of the Securities Act, even if the transaction is effected on behalf of the security\n=======================START OF PAGE 14==\nholders by the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer or by a bank or other independent agent.\nRule 236 relates to situations in which issuers sell stock in order to obtain funds to pay shareholders cash in lieu of fractional interests in connection with a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, conversion, merger or similar transaction.  Rule 236 provides that the sale of stock for that purpose is exempt from registration provided certain conditions are met, including that the issuer is a reporting company; that the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of all shares offered in connection with the transaction for the purpose of providing such funds do not exceed $300,000; and that at least ten days prior to the offering of the shares, the issuer furnishes to the Commission in writing certain information about the transaction.\nThe Task Force recommends that Rule 236 be merged with Rule 152a and that Rule 236 then be eliminated.  As a result, companies considering the treatment of fractional interests need only consult one rule.\nThe Task Force also recommends that, in conjunction with merging the rules, the Commission eliminate the reporting requirement in Rule 236 and increase the $300,000 cap to $600,000.  The $300,000 cap was established in 1982. That number, converted to current dollars based on the CPI-U Index, would be approximately $560,000 today.\n3. Eliminate Securities Act Rules 445, 446, and 447, which relate to securities offered through competitive bidding, because these rules have become obsolete.\nThe Task Force recommends eliminating Rules 445, 446 and 447, which govern registration statements filed in connection with securities to be offered through competitive bidding (e.g., by means of a solicitation of competitive proposals from underwriters).  These rules were promulgated in the late 1940s principally to accommodate registered public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries (\"registered holding companies\").  These companies were subject to Rule 50 under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (\"PUHCA\"), which required that their securities be sold through competitive bids.\nRules 445, 446 and 447 appear to be rarely used at present and are unlikely to be used in the future.  A review of Commission filings shows that there was only one competitive bid filing in 1994, and no competitive bid filings in 1995.  One reason for the lack of filings under these rules may be that, beginning in 1982, the Commission began to relax the rigid bidding requirements of PUHCA Rule 50 in recognition of the fact\n=======================START OF PAGE 15==\nthat these procedures often precluded registered holding companies from obtaining the benefits of the Securities Act Rule 415 shelf registration procedure, placing them at a disadvantage compared to other issuers in getting access to the capital markets on short notice.  In 1994, the Commission determined that competitive bidding was no longer necessary to prevent abuses in the issuance and sale of securities by these companies and rescinded Rule 50.\nIn recommending this course of action, the Task Force does not intend to preclude an issuer from undertaking a competitive bidding process, which will continue to be permissible under other existing rules.\n4.   Eliminate Rule 494, which relates to newspaper prospectuses of foreign government securities, because the rule has become outdated.\nRule 494 was adopted in 1951 to accommodate a then common practice of advertising securities issued by foreign national governments.  The rule limits such \"newspaper prospectuses\" for foreign government securities to advertisements appearing in newspapers, magazines and other periodicals that are distributed by second class mail.  However, the practice appears to have fallen into disuse.  The Task Force believes that this rule is outdated and should be eliminated.\nC.   EXCHANGE ACT RULES\nTwo exemptions from the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act do not appear to serve a useful function.  Both were crafted in another era to address very narrow circumstances.  While the staff is not able to monitor when these exemptions are used, the available evidence suggests that such use is rare.  Thus, the Task Force recommends that these provisions be eliminated.\n1.   Eliminate paragraph (c) of Exchange Act Rule 16b-1, which pertains to the acquisition of securities resulting from a railroad or other carrier reorganization approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\nParagraph (c) of Rule 16b-1 exempts from Section 16(b) the acquisition of securities resulting from a reorganization of a railroad or other carrier approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, an agency that was abolished as of January 1, 1996.\n=======================START OF PAGE 16==\nThe function of approving such reorganizations has now been transferred to the Surface Transportation Board, an independent agency of the Department of Transportation.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission consider eliminating this paragraph since the security to be received in the reorganization is likely to be of a different class than that surrendered, whereas only securities of the same class or securities that are convertible into such class (e.g., equity- based derivatives) are matchable under Section 16(b).\nThese recommendations should be viewed together with other initiatives concerning rules under Section 16(b) which are discussed in \"Other Current Commission Initiatives.\"\n2.   Eliminate Exchange Act Rule 16b-4, which pertains to certain holding company redemption transactions, because the rule is of marginal utility.\nIt is an unusual situation where a holding company owns securities in only one company and desires to exchange its own shares through a redemption for those of that one company.  It is this type of transaction that is protected from Section 16(b) by Rule 16b-4, if the Rules's conditions are met.  Like Rule 16b- 1(c), this Rule does not appear to be used.  Moreover, it also exempts an exchange of one class of securities, or securities that are convertible into such class (e.g., equity-based derivatives), for another class of securities -- a transaction not likely subject to Section 16(b) in any event.  As such, the Task Force recommends that Rule 16b-4 be eliminated.\nD.   FORMS\n1.   Consider eliminating the Form D filing requirement under Regulation D and Section 4(6) of the Securities Act because the requirement has outlived its usefulness.\nThe Commission currently requires the filing of Form D by an issuer that engages in an unregistered offering of its securities in reliance on an exemption under Regulation D or Section 4(6) of the Securities Act.  An issuer also may utilize the form to give notice its reliance on the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption (\"ULOE\") for its securities offering exemption in those states that have adopted ULOE and Form D.  For each claimed exempt offering, an issuer must file a Form D with the Commission no later than 15 days after the offering's first sale of securities.  Form D requires the issuer to disclose basic information\n=====================START OF PAGE 17====\nconcerning the identity of the issuer and the offering, including information regarding the offering price, number of investors, expenses involved, use of proceeds and the exemption claimed.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission, in consultation with North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (\"NASAA\"), consider the continued need for a Form D filing requirement with the Commission.  The Commission does not require an issuer to file a notice when making offerings under other exemptions from Securities Act registration, such as an intrastate offering under the Rule 147 safe harbor.  Furthermore, with the curtailing of Form D's notice requirement in 1986, a current Form D typically provides only minimal information about the filer and the claimed exempt offering.  Similar information regarding unregistered sales is currently required by Item 701 of Regulations S-K and S-B, which applies to an issuer registering an initial public offering or other offering of securities on Form S-1, as well as to a foreign private issuer registering an offering of securities on Form F-1.\nIn addition, the Commission recently proposed to require the disclosure of Item 701 information on a quarterly basis concerning the unregistered sales of equity securities, regardless of the exemption claimed.  See Release No. 33-7189 (June 27, 1995).\nIf Form D were to be eliminated, Rules 503 and 507 also should be eliminated.  Rule 503 sets forth the notice filing requirement for issuers claiming a Regulation D exemption.  Rule 507 provides that an issuer is ineligible to claim a Regulation D exemption if it has previously been subject to a court order for failing to comply with Rule 503.\n2.   Eliminate Form SR and, instead, require the use of proceeds following initial public offerings to be reported on Exchange Act reports.\nSecurities Act Rule 463 requires issuers to report on Form SR the use of proceeds following an initial public offering within ten days of the first three months following the effective date of the registration statement, and every six months thereafter, until the offering has been terminated or all proceeds have been applied.  In 1994 and 1995, 2,103 and 1,635 such filings were made, respectively.\nThe Task Force recommends the elimination of Form SR in favor of requiring first-time issuers to report the use of proceeds on their first Exchange Act report after effectiveness and thereafter on their Exchange Act reports (e.g., quarterly reports) through the termination of the offering or application of the proceeds.  This consolidation of disclosure requirements\n====================START OF PAGE 18====\nwould facilitate reporting by registrants, who would have to comply with fewer forms in satisfying their substantive reporting obligations.  Furthermore, these important disclosures regarding the use of proceeds and the progress of the offering would appear within a filing that is more easily monitored by investors.\nIf the proposal to eliminate Form SR is adopted, Rule 463 of Regulation C, which relates to the reporting of use of proceeds, should be revised to reflect the proposed changes.\n3.   Eliminate Exchange Act Form 8-B, regarding registration of securities of successor issuers, because Exchange Act Rule 12g-3 has rendered the form largely superfluous.\nThe Task Force recommends the elimination of Form 8-B.  This form was adopted in 1936 to provide for registration of securities of certain successor issuers under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.  An issuer uses Form 8-B to register its securities in the situation where the issuer does not have securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, but has succeeded to an issuer that had securities registered under Section 12 at the time of the succession.\nThe Commission received only 59 Form 8-B filings in 1994 and 58 such filings in 1995.  Form 8-B has been rendered largely superfluous by the application of Exchange Act Rule 12g-3 to successor issuers.  In the event of a succession by merger, consolidation, exchange of securities, or acquisition of assets, Rule 12g-3 deems to be registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act the equity securities of an issuer not previously registered under Section 12 that are issued to the holders of equity securities registered pursuant to that section.  Hence, a successor to an issuer with a class of securities registered under Section 12 is deemed to succeed to that registration and need not file a Form 8-B.\nIn order to accommodate the elimination of Form 8-B, the Task Force recommends expanding Rule 12g-3 to include any transactions or securities that are currently covered by Form 8- B, but not Rule 12g-3.  In addition, the Task Force suggests clarifying in Rule 12g-3 the staff's position that the rule applies to issuers with securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, as well as to those with securities registered under Section 12(g).  Consistent with current staff practice, the successor issuer would be required to file a current report on Form 8-K with respect to the transaction and subsequently comply with all the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act.\n=======================START OF PAGE 19==\n4.   Eliminate Form 10-C and Rules 13a-17 and 15d- 17, which require issuers registered under the Exchange Act and quoted in Nasdaq to report certain corporate events to the Commission and the NASD.\nThe Task Force recommends elimination of Rules 13a-17 and 15d-17, as well as related Form 10-C, since the information required to be reported on Form 10-C is already reported on a more detailed basis with the Commission under existing reporting rules.\nUnder Rules 13a-17 and 15d-17, issuers that are registered pursuant to Section 12(g) or subject to Section 15(d) and quoted in Nasdaq are required to file a Form 10-C to report any aggregate increase or decrease in the amount of securities of such class which exceeds five percent of the amount of the class outstanding as last reported, or to report changes in their corporate name.  In 1994 and 1995, 1,515 and 1,635 filings were made, respectively.\nThe rules requiring the filing of Form 10-C were adopted in 1971, shortly after the Nasdaq automated system became operational, in order to provide the NASD with more timely notice of certain events to help in its administration of the new Nasdaq system and its publication of daily price indexes.  The Task Force believes that Form 10-C has outlived its usefulness as a Commission filing and therefore could be eliminated without any loss of information to the market or harm to investors in Nasdaq quoted companies.  In this regard, the Task Force notes that companies whose equity securities are registered under Section 12(g) with the Commission must file all Exchange Act reports with the Commission.\n5.   Eliminate the exhibit requirements of Form 11-K that provide little information that is not otherwise available to plan participants.\nIssuers that have registered interests in employee stock purchase, savings and similar plans under the Securities Act are required to file annual reports with respect to such plans on Form 11-K.  The Task Force recommends that the Commission eliminate the exhibit requirements of Form 11-K.  The exhibits provide little information that is not otherwise available to plan participants, and the Task Force understands that the exhibit requirements  are particularly burdensome to registrants.\n=======================START OF PAGE 20==\nThe Commission alternatively should consider eliminating the Form 11-K requirement for ERISA plans.  Much of the information elicited by the form relates rather narrowly to the plan and its management, rather than to the registrant and its financial condition.  The key element of Form 11-K, for example, is the plan's audited financial statements.  However, plan management is principally a concern of laws other than the securities laws (i.e., ERISA).\nIn considering this recommendation, the Commission should take into account that plan financial statements included in Form 11-K typically are incorporated by reference into a registration statement on Form S-8.  The Commission also should consider whether any relief resulting from this recommendation should be extended to plans that are not covered by ERISA.\nEliminate Items 3(e) and 4(a) of Form F-6, governing the registration of American Depositary Receipts, because the elicited information appears to be rarely used.\nItem 3(e)\nItem 3(e) of Form F-6 requires the registrant to include, as an exhibit, the name of each dealer known to the registrant who has deposited shares against issuance of American Depositary Receipts, proposes to deposit shares or participated in a plan to deposit shares, within the past six months.  The Task Force recommends that this item be eliminated because the required information appears to be of little use to the marketplace.  In addition, because the base number of outstanding shares is not normally publicly available, the information regarding semi- annual adjustments to that number appears to be of little use.\nItem 4(a)\nUnder current rules, a registrant on Form F-6 must undertake to provide semi-annual updated information generally concerning dealers depositing shares in the facility and the number of shares issued/cancelled during the covered period.  The Task Force recommends elimination of this requirement, embodied in Item 4(a), because the required information appears to be of little use to the marketplace.  In addition, because the base number of outstanding shares is not normally publicly available, the information regarding semi-annual adjustments to that number appears to be of little use.\n=======================START OF PAGE 21==\nII.  PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION\nFrom the investor's prospective, disclosure may not be effective unless it is understandable, complete and timely.  Fulfillment of each of these goals sometimes may be hindered by current practices in drafting documents.  These goals, and suggestions for better achieving them, are discussed more fully below.\nA.   CLEAR AND ACCURATE DISCLOSURE\n1.   Develop a \"plain English\" introduction to the prospectus to enhance its readability by individual investors, by eliminating boilerplate \"legalese\" and requiring a summary of key information.\nThe U.S. securities markets are built upon the foundation of full and fair disclosure.  The prospectus, the basic disclosure document used to sell securities in public offerings, contains information about the issuer, including its business, its management and financial condition, enabling market participants to make informed judgments about a company and its prospects.  The prospectus also contains information specific to the offering such as risk factors, use of proceeds, the terms of the securities and the underwriting arrangement.  Availability of this information has played a significant role in the success of the U.S. capital markets and confidence in their integrity.\nAs a practical matter, however, prospectuses often are far more useful to the professional investor than to most retail investors.  While prospectuses contain certain complex material often relating to the description of securities, even basic information about an issuer's business is written in a way that has been described as \"turgid,\" \"opaque\" and \"unreadable.\"   Drafters claim that this dense writing style stems in part from an effort to meet the high standard of diligence under the Securities Act that is imposed on companies, management and underwriters with respect to the adequacy and accuracy of disclosures provided to investors.  Issuers, underwriters and their lawyers produce defensively written documents that put a premium on legal jargon and over-inclusive disclosures.  Trivial points sometimes receive as much attention as material information, and in the end may bury points significant to an investment decision.  In the eyes of many, today's prospectus has become a legal document to shield against liability, rather than a useful and informative disclosure document, as contemplated by the Commission's current \"plain English\" rule, Rule 421 of Regulation C under the Securities Act and case law.  See e.g., McMahan & Co. v. Wherehouse Entertainment, Inc., 900 F.2d 576 (2d\n=======================START OF PAGE 22==\nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1249 (1991); In re Franchard Corp., Release No. 33-4710, [1964-1966 Transfer Binder] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH)   77,113 (July 31, 1964).  This unfortunate result especially is evident with respect to offering documents relating to initial public offerings and complex transactions.  As Chairman Levitt recently observed, \"our passion for full disclosure has created fact-bloated reports and prospectuses that are more redundant than revealing.\"\nThe Task Force believes that issuers, management and underwriters should begin drafting and using \"plain English\" offering materials.  As a first step, the Task Force briefly sets forth below its recommendations for presenting information on the front cover, inside cover and first page or back cover of a prospectus.  The Task Force also suggests the use of a \"plain English\" glossary to explain technical terms used in the document.  Further, the Task Force recommends that the Commission consider publishing an interpretive release to assist in the preparation of \"plain English\" disclosure documents by every issuer; a release similar to that published in 1991 with respect to the importance of clear, concise and comprehensible disclosure in offering materials used by limited partnerships and other direct participation investment programs.  See Release No. 33- 6900 (June 17, 1991).\nProspectus Cover.  The Task Force recommends eliminating many of the legal warnings on the cover page.  In their current form, these warnings often convey little useful information, and, because they are written in dense capital letters, also are virtually unreadable.  Instead, the cover should be more inviting to the reader, and legal warnings that continue to be necessary should be set forth in a more readable style and format.\nInside Cover.  The Task Force believes that the inside cover should be required to contain a table of contents and summary financial information, either in tabular or graphic form, which the issuer and underwriter believe would be useful to a potential investor.\nFirst Page or Back Cover.  The Task Force recommends a format that, in addition to basic information about the issuer, would include: (i) a summary paragraph of key points of interest (including a characterization of risk); and (ii) a tabular presentation of features of the offering, such as the exchange where the securities are traded, company dividend policy, etc.  The Task Force also recommends that the Commission consider requiring the tabular presentation to include certain items that are not now required, but which may assist investors in understanding the offering, such as the effect of dilution (which is now required only in initial public offerings) and certain significant financial ratios.\n=======================START OF PAGE 23==\nOther Presentation Suggestions.  The Task Force recommends that the Commission clarify that disclosure regarding the risks of the offering pursuant to Item 503 of Regulation S-K must be set forth in full in the forepart of the prospectus and cannot be incorporated by reference from other filings or portions of the document.\nSamples.  Included at the end of this section are two illustrations of the first few pages of a prospectus in a more plain English format.\n2.   Require a \"plain English\" summary sheet in tender offer statements, which would function as a \"road map\" by providing shareholders with answers to commonly asked questions about the offer.\nIn connection with a tender offer, shareholders are furnished with a disclosure document known as an \"Offer to Purchase,\" which provides information about the bidder, the terms and conditions of the offer and the procedures for tendering shares required by Exchange Act Regulations 14D and 14E or Rule 13E-4.  These documents often are quite lengthy and contain technical and legal terms not commonly understood by the reader.  The Task Force recommends that the Commission include tender offer materials within its plain English initiatives so as to make these lengthy, complex and legalistic documents more understandable.\nOne suggestion to facilitate shareholder comprehension of the essential terms and provisions of the offer is the use of a glossary to explain technical terms used elsewhere in the tender offer materials.  Another idea is a \"plain English\" summary.  This summary, which would begin on the inside cover page of the Offer to Purchase, would provide investors with a ready reference to certain basic information about the offer.  The information would be presented as responses to common shareholder questions, such as the following:\nWho is the person offering to buy the securities?\nWhat are the classes and amounts of securities being sought?\nHow much is the bidder paying and what will be the form of payment?\nIs information on the bidder's financial condition relevant to my decision whether to tender?\nHow long do I have to decide whether to tender?\n=======================START OF PAGE 24==\nWhat are the most significant conditions to the offer?\nHow do I tender my shares?\nHow may I withdraw my tendered shares?\nIf the transaction is a consensual one, what does my board of directors think of this offer?\nIs this the first step in a going private transaction?\nWill this tender offer be followed by a merger if not all of the company's shares are tendered?\nIf I decide not to tender, how will the tender offer affect my shares?\nWhat is the market value (if traded) or the net asset or liquidation value (if not traded) of my shares?\nWho can I talk to if I have questions about the offer?\nEach of the items briefly described in the summary would reference a more detailed discussion elsewhere in the tender offer materials.  Bidders also would provide a statement at the bottom of the summary to the effect that the Offer to Purchase must be reviewed in its entirety for a full understanding of the offer.\nAn example of a sample summary relating to a \"plain vanilla\" cash tender offer is included at the end of this section.  Of course, the exact contents of the summary will depend upon the structure and terms of the particular transaction.  For instance, a summary relating to a tender offer for limited partnership interests would have to include summarized risk factor disclosure in bullet point format, as well as highlight conflicts of interests faced by general partners and other affiliates in making the offer.\nThe Task Force also recommends that the Commission consider whether a summary should be required in any solicitation or recommendation by the target company to the holders of the security to accept or reject the tender offer.\n3.   Allow registrants to include earnings releases, which often are written in \"plain English,\" in their quarterly reports, thereby making such reports more readable and easier to prepare.\n=======================START OF PAGE 25==\nThe Task Force recommends permitting registrants to use quarterly earnings releases in place of, or in conjunction with, the quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  Quarterly earnings releases typically are issued shortly after the end of the quarter, before the Form 10-Q is prepared.  In addition to quarterly financial information, earnings releases often include a narrative discussion of other material developments that, unlike the filing on Form 10-Q, is typically in a \"plain English\" format.\nThe Commission should permit companies to file their earnings releases under cover of a Form 10-Q, provided that such releases and any accompanying disclosures contain all of the information required by the form.  Other than requiring that Management's Discussion and Analysis be set forth in a single coherent discussion in accordance with applicable Commission and staff positions, there would be no restrictions on the format or order in which information is presented, so long as the presentation is balanced, informative and easily understood.\nThis recommendation should enhance the readability of quarterly information since earnings releases usually are written in a clear, less legalistic manner than the required Form 10-Q.  At the same time, the recommendation may reduce the regulatory burden on registrants, who will be spared the requirement to re- order quarterly information in the format required by Form 10-Q.  The Task Force notes that this recommendation is not intended to lessen the quality of disclosure, and recognizes there is a risk that this idea possibly could result in the preparers of earnings releases switching to a more formalistic document -- a result that should be avoided since it would defeat the \"plain English\" goal.\nB.   UNEVEN DISCLOSURE\nApart from the need for plain and simple disclosure, there arises the issue of whether the Commission should attempt to encourage issuers to provide investors with \"better\" information than is now mandated.  In particular, the Commission should consider ways to further encourage the disclosure of so-called \"soft information\" or voluntary forward-looking information.\nThe value of forward-looking information to investors has been debated for the last 20 years.  Until the early 1970s, issuers were prohibited from providing this information to investors because the Commission believed it was inherently speculative and created an opportunity for abuse.  With the adoption of a safe harbor in 1979, the disclosure of forward- looking information was not only permitted, it was affirmatively encouraged.  This safe harbor was intended to provide protection from liabilities under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act for companies that make projections in good faith and on a\n=======================START OF PAGE 26==\nreasonable basis in Commission filings.  This was done because the Commission recognized that many investors and analysts found such information extremely useful in assessing the merits of investing in a particular company.\nOver the years, issuers have provided this information orally to professional analysts and investors, either over the telephone or personally at so-called \"road shows\" (typically meetings hosted by issuers and underwriters with potential investors).  By providing this information orally, issuers have avoided Securities Act Section 11 liability that attaches to a registration statement at the time of effectiveness.  Further, it is believed that issuers are less likely to fear unfounded lawsuits by professional investors.\nAs a result, some believe that two separate (but parallel) disclosure systems have developed -- one for retail customers and one for professionals.  The Commission itself recognized the existence of concerns in this area in connection with its Safe Harbor Concept Release.  See Release No. 33-7101 (Oct. 13, 1994).\nIn that release, the Commission sought comment on a panoply of issues relating to the disclosure of forward-looking information, including whether mandatory disclosure of projections in prospectuses was an appropriate solution to the problem of \"road- show\" selective disclosure.\nEarly in its inquiry, the Task Force evaluated concerns that have been raised with respect to this perceived disparity of disclosure, with a view toward recommending that the Commission consider requiring a fair summary in the front of the prospectus of any \"road show\" information (whether communicated orally or in writing).  Based on the Commission's historic experience in this area, however, the Task Force was mindful that issuers likely would resist providing such disclosure absent assurances of some additional measure of protection.  During the pendency of the Task Force, in December 1995, Congress enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act creating a statutory safe harbor from liabilities from private rights of action arising from the disclosure of specified forward-looking information.  As a result, it is uncertain at this early stage whether issuers will feel sufficient comfort to volunteer more forward-looking information in reliance upon the statutory safe harbor.  It is important to note, moreover, that the new statutory safe harbor excludes, among other types of transactions, all initial public offerings.  Accordingly, the Task Force suggests that the Commission's staff continue to monitor developments in this area.\nC.   TIMELY DELIVERY OF INFORMATION\n=======================START OF PAGE 27==\nRegardless of how simple or how complete a prospectus is, it cannot aid an investment decision unless it is received prior to the time the decision is made.  As discussed in greater detail in \"Securities Act Concepts,\" however, questions as to the appropriate timing and method of providing disclosure to investors are being widely debated. The Task Force believes that there is no quick fix in this complex area, and that the Commission should give full and careful consideration to these questions and the divergent solutions now being debated.\nD.   ELECTRONIC MEDIA\nDiscussions about the potential promises of electronic technology are not new.  Even three decades ago, securities law experts were predicting that developments in communications technology would provide opportunities for improving disclosure, while at the same time reducing the cost of disseminating information to investors.  In his 1966 article entitled \"Truth in Securities Revisited,\" which contains proposals that contributed to the development of the integrated disclosure system, Professor Milton H. Cohen called the promises of technological development \"the real hope and challenge\" of securities regulation.\nThe potential promises in using electronic media as a disclosure medium are developing rapidly with respect to all types of information, including that relating to capital-raising activities and secondary trading in the securities markets.  Technological developments are making it possible to deliver documents electronically, such as prospectuses that until recently were delivered in paper format.  Just this past October, the Commission issued an interpretive release regarding the use of electronic media to deliver information under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Investment Company Act.  See Release No. 33-7233 (October 6, 1995).\nMeanwhile, access to most EDGAR documents has been commonplace for some time now for investors and the financial markets.  And very recently, the Commission started its own \"home page\" on the Internet (World Wide Web address http://www.sec.gov), which contains Commission filings, rule proposals, litigation releases, opinions, speeches, testimony and press releases, as well as an electronic copy of this Report.\nAs is often the case, these positive developments are accompanied by some challenges of equal magnitude, some of which are unfolding with equivalent speed.  Such disclosure challenges include establishing controls and procedures to ensure that information is presented in a clear, understandable format, that information is adequate and accurate, and that it is subject to the review of effective \"gatekeepers.\"  In addition, the Commission will likely be called upon to evaluate the\n=======================START OF PAGE 28==\neffectiveness and efficiency of disseminating information through delivery, publication and/or access, and to respond to the ever- increasing pace of information flow.  Indeed, the pace of information flow in some respects appears to have already begun to erode some of the assumptions traditionally made by securities regulators, such as the existence of natural \"information barriers.\"  Some of these challenges, and possible responses to them, are discussed more fully in \"Securities Act Concepts.\"\nWhile resolution of these rapidly developing broad disclosure and legal questions in the electronic world is not within the scope or capability of the Task Force given the time- frame established for its work, the Task Force has included in this Report a few incremental recommendations designed to make the EDGAR system more user-friendly.\nIllustrations for This Section\nA.   STRAINS IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\n1.  Introduction\nIn connection with the Task Force's review of existing rules, regulations and forms, questions have been raised with respect to several premises of, and concepts underlying, the Securities Act regulatory framework.  Many of these questions currently are the subject of considerable debate, both within and outside the Commission.  First instituted in the 1930s and revised over the years by Congress and the Commission, the intricate web of Securities Act provisions and rules governing the capital formation process have been criticized by some as excessively restrictive in light of present market conditions and, by others, as unduly lax in protecting investors.  While none of the various participants in this debate seriously questions the fundamental importance of and need for full, fair and timely disclosure of information to investors, there is substantial disagreement as to how that goal best can be accomplished given the constant evolution of today's capital markets.   A number of initiatives thus have been undertaken by the Commission, Congress, state regulators and the private sector, in an effort to reassess the continuing effectiveness of the Securities Act registration, prospectus delivery and other requirements.\nAmong these initiatives are the Commission's formation in early 1995 of the Advisory Committee on the Capital Formation and Regulatory Processes (\"Advisory Committee\"), which is chaired by Commissioner Wallman, and the Commission's publication for comment in mid-1995 of still-pending proposals to permit \"testing the waters\" in advance of an initial public offering (Release No. 33-7188 (June 27, 1995)); to re-consider the prohibition on general solicitation and advertising for private placements (Release No. 33-7185 (June 27, 1995)); and to craft appropriate rule revisions to keep pace with transfers of economic or other interests in securities through equity swaps, forwards and other arrangements -- commonly known as \"derivatives\" -- without any accompanying transfer of legal title to the underlying \"physical\" instrument (Release No. 33-7187 (June 27, 1995); Release No. 33- 7190 (June 27, 1995)).  Other initiatives include legislation introduced by Congressman Fields (Capital Markets Deregulation and Liberalization Act of 1995, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995)), and a blue-ribbon panel formed this past October by NASAA, of which Commissioner Wallman is a member.\nThe following discussion distills some of the ongoing debate regarding the need to adapt existing Securities Act\n=======================START OF PAGE 30==\nrequirements and related concepts to current market conditions, by outlining certain perceived strains in the system, the resultant problems for raising capital and timely dissemination of full and fair disclosure to investors, and a comprehensive solution and several narrow proposals that address certain of the perceived strains.  The Task Force also is recommending a \"quick fix\" that, if adopted by the Commission, could resolve one issue without preempting the Commission's ability to evaluate the merits of any proposed broader initiatives.  Recognizing therefore that these issues should be and are being fully and publicly deliberated in such diverse fora as the Advisory Committee, Commission rulemaking proceedings and the Congress, the Task Force believes that Commission implementation of the specific \"quick fix\" discussed below, as well as the concepts discussed under \"Facilitating Capital-Raising,\" could serve to reduce unnecessary costs of corporate capital formation consistent with the disclosure objectives of the Securities Act.\n2.  Snapshot of the Securities Act Regulatory Scheme\nThe Securities Act has served the U.S. financial markets well over the past 60-plus years.  The volume of securities trading on the exchanges has doubled since 1935, increasing from $176 billion to $3.5 trillion.  In 1934, businesses raised $641 million in our capital markets; in 1984, $126.8 billion; and last year, that figure broke a trillion dollars.\nAs adopted in 1933 and later amended by Congress, the Securities Act is intended to ensure that investors receive full and fair disclosure with respect to securities offerings by issuers and their affiliates.  To this end, the Securities Act requires registration of every offer or sale of a security and delivery of a prescribed prospectus to investors unless the securities transaction complies with one of the enumerated statutory exemptions contained in Sections 3 and 4 of the Securities Act.  In general, these exemptions reflect legislative judgments that certain types of investors or securities in certain types of offerings do not necessarily require the protections afforded by the Securities Act.  One exemption of particular importance in the U.S. capital markets is the private offering exemption allowing issuers to offer and sell unregistered securities to financially sophisticated investors able to \"fend for themselves.\"\nIn short, the statutory framework of the Securities Act provides that, absent an exemption:\n=======================START OF PAGE 31==\nNo security may be offered for sale until a registration statement containing prescribed information is filed with the Commission;\nAfter a registration statement is filed, oral and written offers are permitted.  Written offers must be made by means of a statutory prospectus; use of sales literature or other writings are prohibited during this \"waiting\" period;\nAfter a registration statement becomes effective, either by lapse of time or more typically by Commission action, the confirmation of sale and other offering materials such as sales literature may be distributed to investors so long as the confirmation of sale and sales literature are accompanied or preceded by the final statutory prospectus; and\nAfter a registration statement becomes effective, securities may be delivered for sale so long as they are accompanied or preceded by the final statutory prospectus.\nMoreover, securities sold other than pursuant to a public offering may be subject to strict limitations on resale, rules regarding how they can be offered and sold, etc.\nIn interpreting and administering the statutory scheme, the courts and Commission early on developed several Securities Act concepts, including:\n\"general solicitation\" -- broadly construed to mean identifying persons interested in acquiring securities in a private offering through advertisements or soliciting activities beyond persons having a pre-existing relationship with the issuer or placement agent;\n\"gun jumping\" or \"conditioning the market\" -- broadly construed to mean impermissible soliciting activities both prior to the filing of a registration statement and during the \"waiting period\" between such filing and the effective date; and\n\"integration\" -- generally the combination of either two or more ostensibly separate exempt offerings, or an exempt offering and registered offering, to assess compliance with the\n=======================START OF PAGE 32==\nregistration and prospectus delivery requirements of the claimed exempt offering.\nOver the years, the Commission or its staff has modified these concepts to accommodate changes in the securities markets, including the rapid globalization of those markets, the growth in institutional ownership of corporate equity and debt securities, the continuing development of new corporate financing techniques, and technological advances in communication.  To illustrate, the Commission recognized early in its history that the integration concept might operate to impede unnecessarily legitimate capital raising transactions.  Accordingly, the Commission in 1935 adopted Rule 152 providing for a limited exception from application of this concept to integrate legitimate private offerings with subsequent public offerings.  Beginning with a 1986 interpretive letter (Verticom (avail. February 12, 1986)), the Commission staff has given issuers some comfort that an otherwise valid private placement would not be integrated with a subsequent public offering despite the fact that the public offering was contemplated at the time of the private placement.  Previously, Rule 152 had been construed by many to mean that the public offering could not have been contemplated at the time of the prior private offering.\nFurther, the Commission has adopted safe harbors to guide issuers seeking to conduct legitimate unregistered offerings (Regulation D and Regulation S), and investors in reselling privately (Rule 144A), based on the fundamental principle that registration should be required only for those offerings made in the U.S. markets to persons who require the full panoply of safeguards afforded by the Securities Act.  One such safe harbor created a \"bright-line\" integration test assuring companies that any offers or sales of securities they might make more than six months after completion of a private placement or other exempt offering under Regulation D would not be considered part of the previous offering.  A later refinement of the integration concept was made in a staff no-action and interpretive letter (Black Box Inc. (avail. June 26, 1990)), which permits an otherwise valid private offering to a limited number of qualified buyers to be conducted concurrently with a registered public offering on the policy ground that such buyers possess the requisite level of sophistication to request the information they deem necessary to informed investment decision making through means other than a registration statement, and that investors in the registered offering are not adversely affected.\n3.  Specific Strains in the Regulatory Framework\nWhile the success of Commission and staff initiatives in this area is evidenced daily by the efficient operation of the\n=======================START OF PAGE 33==\npublic and private markets, strains in the current regulatory system are appearing in connection with various categories of securities offerings.  In some cases, more and more people are asking whether the Securities Act's framework, at least as currently interpreted and administered, is working to frustrate, rather than to facilitate, the dissemination of information required, or in some instances demanded, by investors and other market participants.  Five developments have been identified for the Task Force as eroding the Securities Act's effectiveness:\nTechnological developments in the field of electronic communications;\nErosion of traditional distinctions between public and private offerings;\nGlobalization of the capital markets and concomitant erosion of \"country walls\" between such markets;\nNovel financing instruments, methods of raising capital and risk management initiatives; and\nRegulatory initiatives designed to reduce other market risks, such as those relating to the clearance and settlement system, which are compressing the time frame for many offerings.\nThe list is not intended to be all inclusive.  Many other concerns have been raised.  For example, delays in accessing the capital markets due to the need to file a registration statement for each offering may frustrate the issuer community.  When issuers take advantage of the current shelf procedure, frustrations still may develop due to the need to register securities in advance, e.g., market overhang concerns.  Moreover, distinctions and rules regulating \"restricted securities\" and securities sold offshore that flow back to the United States without any investor protections are also issues and concerns.  The Advisory Committee has been studying and evaluating these and other strains and issues for the past year and the system it currently is reviewing intends to address these and other problems within the statutory framework while enhancing investor protection.\na.   Difficulties of Regulating Information Flow\nRegulatory requirements that result in the imposition of artificial barriers to the flow of accurate information generally are not effective, in some cases not possible, and are viewed by some as not ultimately in the best interests of investors and the markets.  Whether for better or worse, market\n=======================START OF PAGE 34==\ndynamics with respect to various securities transactions are starting to outstrip or have outstripped the current regulations.  For example:\nDramatic advances in electronic communications have made corporate communications, financial, business and marketing information, analyst research reports and other information more widely and instantaneously accessible through the Internet, Bloomberg's and other computer-based information service providers.  As a consequence, in some offerings information outside of the mandated disclosure package -- the registration statement and the traditional prospectus that is part of the registration statement -- is readily available to and accessible by computer-literate investors acquiring securities in public offerings and secondary trading transactions.  Because of the Securities Act's broad coverage of offers as interpreted by the Commission, legal uncertainties exist as to whether dissemination of this information may give rise to impermissible offers.\nInformation relating to the private securities markets, such as secondary price data and securities ratings, is accessible to sophisticated and unsophisticated investors alike.  Similarly, information disseminated by a foreign company that is directed to persons outside the United States often is accessible to U.S. as well as foreign investors through the company's Website on the Internet, Bloomberg's, the press and other information service providers.  Again, the Securities Act's broad coverage of offers as interpreted by the Commission raises legal uncertainties as to whether dissemination of this information may give rise to impermissible offers.\nCompliance with required prospectus delivery obligations has become more and more difficult, and in some cases not possible.  Questions frequently are raised about how to provide investors with disclosure that is received in sufficient time to be useful in making investment decisions.  For example:\nTensions have arisen between the prospectus delivery scheme of the Securities Act and private and public initiatives to minimize risk exposure by reducing clearance and settlement periods.  Compliance with physical delivery of a final statutory prospectus before or concurrently with\n=======================START OF PAGE 35==\nthe confirmation of sale is becoming more and more difficult within today's \"T+3\" clearance and settlement period.  This delivery problem likely will be exacerbated, unless more flexible means are used or permitted for communication, such as electronic delivery of information (see Release No. 33-7233 (Oct. 6, 1995)) and incorporation by reference if the financial markets generally were to move to a \"T+1\" clearance and settlement period, notwithstanding the Commission's recent adaptation of its prospectus delivery rules to accommodate T+3.\nb.   What's Being Offered and Sold: Impact of Proliferation of Derivative Securities on the Regulatory Structure\nToday's regulatory structure focuses on offers, sales or transfers of legal title to a security evidencing a bundle of rights and obligations.  However, securities transactions more and more frequently are premised on the concept of buying, selling or transferring financial, economic or investment risks and/or interests through swap agreements, forward contracts, options, option-like products and other derivative instruments.  It is not unusual now for a company contemplating future sales of additional shares of stock to enter into \"hedging\" transactions for the purpose of minimizing its exposure to downward market price movements in its stock.  The counterparty to the transaction, such as an investment banking firm, may manage its risk exposure by engaging in short selling activities in the trading markets.  (Generally speaking, short selling occurs when a person sells securities he or she does not own and subsequently settles the trade by either borrowing securities from another investor or buying the securities in the market.)  Nor is it unusual for an investment banking firm bidding to underwrite an offering of new debt securities to hedge its exposure to movements in market rates of interest by entering into an interest swap agreement with a third party.  Risk management activities effected through instruments that attempt to shift some or all of the economic risk to the public markets are becoming a regular way of doing business.  While the Commission has sought through the rulemaking process to identify needed adjustments of existing rules to track economic risk-shifting and other unique or novel features of these transactions (e.g., Release No. 33-7250 (Dec. 28, 1995) (proposed Regulation S-K 305 relating to disclosure of derivatives); Release No. 33-7190 (June 27, 1995) (Regulation S release); Release No. 33-7187 (June 27, 1995) (proposed Rule 144 and Section 16(a) rule revisions)), much more must be learned before a comprehensive solution to these developments can be formulated.\n=======================START OF PAGE 36==\nc.   Perceived Over-Regulation of Offers\nA further regulatory dilemma stems from applications of the gun-jumping and integration doctrines to prevent use of certain financing techniques in circumstances where investor protection concerns arguably are not implicated.  Due to Commission interpretations, substantial legal uncertainties exist today with respect to the ability of a company to begin an offering of securities in reliance on the private offering exemption, and later switch to a registered public offering.  Again due to Commission interpretation, substantial legal uncertainties regarding the validity of a private offering also exist when a company commences a public offering, withdraws its registration statement upon losing its market window, and makes a private placement of securities of the same class to financially sophisticated investors, unless it waits another six months.  Despite the Black Box letter discussed above, companies remain reluctant to make limited private offerings to sophisticated buyers during a registered offering because of integration and general solicitation concerns.  Legal and other commentators maintain that the uncertainties (and concomitant costs) surrounding an issuer's ability, based on current interpretation, to complete as registered an offering commenced privately, to conduct simultaneous private and public offerings, or to place privately securities with sophisticated buyers following a terminated public offering, unduly interfere with the capital formation process without providing countervailing investor protections.\nd.   Prospectus Delivery\nAnother regulatory problem relates to the required method of delivering Securities Act prospectuses to investors.  As discussed, the acceleration of the offering process attendant to adoption of T+3 would be increased in the event the markets evolve further toward a T+1 environment.  Even now as a result of often conflicting time pressures, the statutory prospectus may not be delivered until after the confirmation of sale.\n4.  Advisory Committee on the Capital Formation and Regulatory Processes:  Company Registration\nFollowing a one-year study, the Advisory Committee is in the process of completing its report to the Commission recommending a package of concepts termed \"company registration.\"  The purpose of company registration is to streamline and lower the costs of the capital formation process, improve investor protection and enhance corporate disclosure.  In addition, the Advisory\n=======================START OF PAGE 37==\nCommittee intends that the company registration system, in full implementation, resolve all the various identified deficiencies in the current regulatory system for already public companies.  At a public meeting held February 22, 1996, the Advisory Committee agreed upon the core elements of the company registration model, which would be implemented on an experimental basis pursuant to simple rule changes (described below) during a two-year, voluntary pilot project should the Commission adopt the Advisory Committee's recommendation.  The Committee therefore directed its staff to complete a final draft of its Report and Recommendations for submission to the Commission, subject to additional revision in light of the last meeting's discussion and final review by the members.\nAs approved by the Advisory Committee, the company registration model to be presented to the Commission will recommend a shift in regulatory focus from the present, transaction-by-transaction registration of securities offerings by seasoned reporting companies, to the one-time, \"pay-as-you-go\" registration of such companies and all securities they (or their affiliates) might issue thereafter.  Except for specified exceptions that the Advisory Committee believes the Commission should carve out solely for purposes of the pilot program, securities issued by a registered company would be deemed registered for both Securities Act and Exchange Act purposes, so long as the company continued to meet prescribed eligibility conditions (e.g., for purposes of the pilot, a two-year Commission reporting history, national stock exchange or Nasdaq/NMS listing, and $75 million public float).\nCompany registration would have, among others, the following effects:\npermit disclosure to be incorporated by reference into a confirmation of a sale rather than require physical delivery of all information to a purchaser;\nallow identification of selling security holders in and underwriter(s) of a shelf offering at the time of the offering;\nallow a post-effective amendment to a shelf registration statement to include reallocation of previously registered securities and registration of new classes of securities;\npermit registration by certain issuers of a dollar amount without specification of the related classes of securities;\n=======================START OF PAGE 38==\neliminate staff review of all offering documents, except those involving \"extraordinary\" transactions (e.g., mergers of equals), and shift focus of staff review to periodic and current reports;\npermit registration fees to be paid at the time of a takedown from a shelf offering -- \"pay as you go\";\nnarrow the class of persons considered affiliates of the issuer; and\nallow all acquisitions effected through an issuance of company stock, except those constituting \"extraordinary\" transactions (involving changes of more than 40 percent of a company's outstanding capitalization), to be made immediately off the shelf; as a consequence, all mergers, exchange offers, and other business combinations that fall below the 40 percent threshold can be made without a Securities Act waiting period -- having the effect of placing such mergers and exchange offers on the same time table as cash tender offers.\nAlong with focusing on the need to streamline the offering process to reduce the costs of corporate capital-raising, the Advisory Committee plans to recommend various disclosure enhancements that are designed to benefit investors in the context of securities offerings by issuers and affiliates, and the secondary trading markets.  Specifically, use of the system would be conditioned upon the following enhancements:  (1) additional reports to the board by senior management on compliance, on a continuous basis, with disclosure procedures established to ensure the integrity and accuracy of periodic and current reports and to avoid potential insider trading abuses; (2) inclusion of risk factors in Forms 10-K; (3) expansion and acceleration of reporting of material events on Form 8-K; and (4) certification by top managers, attached as exhibit to the Form 10-K, that they have reviewed all Exchange Act reports and are not aware of any materially false or misleading disclosures or omissions.  Additional guidance would be provided regarding the due diligence responsibilities of such gatekeepers as underwriters, auditors and outside directors, with a view toward improving practices in this area.\nImplementation of the two-year pilot company registration system, which as noted would be available on a voluntary basis only to seasoned companies, would be accomplished pursuant to a series of rule amendments within the context of the current statutory framework.  The necessary changes for the streamlining\n=======================START OF PAGE 39==\nconcepts, almost all of which are similar if not identical to the Task Force's recommendations for seasoned issuers outlined in \"Facilitating Capital-Raising,\" would entail use of a new company registration form (Form C-1), modeled on current Form S-3 and the shelf registration procedure, with certain modifications.  In addition to a \"pay-as-you-go\" fee regime, the system would include provisions for prior Commission staff review of offering documents filed in connection with \"extraordinary\" transactions (as previously described), and, significant to the Advisory Committee, extension of Section 11 strict liability to takedown prospectus supplements by requiring that they be filed on Form 8- K no later than the sale of securities.  There would be no change in the nature or amount of disclosure required to be on file with the Commission at the time of the sale of securities -- all current line-item disclosure requirements would carry over to the pilot.\n5.  Other Suggestions\nThe Advisory Committee has labored to devise a comprehensive and detailed model to lower the costs of the capital formation process, improve investor protection and enhance corporate disclosure.  The model seeks to address all of the perceived strains on the system for already public companies.  Several other ideas have been floated to address certain of the perceived strains described above.\na.   Regulating the Flow of Information\nOne approach is set forth in a speech delivered by Linda C. Quinn, former Director of the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance to the fall meeting of the American Bar Associations' Federal Regulation of Securities Committee in Washington, D. C. (Linda C. Quinn, Reforming the Securities Act of 1933:  A Conceptual Framework, 10 Insights 25 (Jan. 1996)).  This approach suggests that offers be deregulated and the mandate that the statutory prospectus be the only written communication during the offering period be reconsidered.  The speech posits whether the federal securities laws might better serve investors by assuring the free flow of fair and accurate communications, whether written or oral, rather than by restricting the content and manner of any communications.  Distinctions between oral and written communications would be removed.\nIn addition to the manner in which information is communicated to investors, the speech also suggests that the traditional single uniform approach to delivery of the mandated prospectus may no longer be warranted.  Rather, it is suggested that the costs of delivering a mandated document be balanced against the benefits provided to investors.\n=======================START OF PAGE 40==\nAnother suggestion being floated that relates to deregulating offers and revisiting the mandated delivery system would be to provide information about the issuer and its securities through a core information file available at the Commission.  The content of this file has not yet been fleshed out.  Under this idea, strict liability under Section 11, now applicable to false and misleading registration statements, would attach to the core information file.  While written or oral offers of securities could be made without the necessity of compliance with the statutory prospectus requirement (in the case of the written offers), no sales could be effected until the company's core data base file is current and complete.  Negligence liability under Section 12(2) would apply to all material outside the core file.  Because information in the core file would be publicly available and accessible by any investor, the requirement to deliver the information (today through the statutory prospectus) prior to or along with the confirmation of sale would be eliminated.  The description provided to the Task Force did not distinguish between seasoned and unseasoned issuers.\nb.   \"Pink Herring\" Registration of Offers\nA countervailing approach intending to maintain the investor protection benefits in the Securities Act, to the deregulating offers concept just described, would permit offers to be made after an issuer filed a highly simplified, short form and inexpensive registration statement (termed by some a \"pink herring\").  Thereafter, the company could elect whether to pursue a public or a private offering in light of the type and level of investment interest thus elicited.  Far broader in scope than the pending \"IPO test the waters\" proposal (see Release No. 33-7188 (June 27, 1995)) because it would permit general soliciting communications that are clearly \"offers\" subject to Securities Act registration, and permit non-registered sales to be made on the basis of registered offers, this approach is premised on a similar concern for reducing unnecessary financing costs.\nPrivate or already public companies could \"test the waters\" without risking a violation of the statute by filing the \"pink herring\" containing limited price, type of security, distribution and financial information.  They then would be permitted to make a general solicitation and public offer and obtain a preliminary assessment whether enough market interest exists to warrant the expense of a fully registered public offering.  Regardless of the amount of securities intended to be offered, the initial filing fee would be nominal, such as $250.  If investor interest in registered securities were deemed sufficient to justify the costs, the issuer subsequently could pursue a fully registered public offering (distribution of a traditional red herring and final prospectus subject to the full\n=======================START OF PAGE 41==\npanoply of Securities Act liabilities, and payment of the full registration fee).  If instead, the issuer determines that it can sell only privately, to financially sophisticated investors pursuant to a private offering, it could proceed in that direction without waiting six months between the public, or \"registered,\" offers and a subsequent private placement.  A new safe harbor would prevent integration of the registered offers and non-registered sales, subject to specified conditions.  Concerns about protecting the retail investing public should not be implicated if only qualified, non-retail investors would be allowed to purchase the privately placed securities (alternatively, placement could be permitted under any other applicable exemption without regard to any general solicitation limitation).\n6.  Quick and Narrow Fixes -- Task Force Recommendations\nIn addition to the specific suggestions described below, the Task Force also outlines other more general ideas in Subpart 7 that follows.\na.   Revise Rule 152\nThe safe harbor of Rule 152 is limited to a private offering conducted in reliance on the Section 4(2) private placement exemption (this would include the limited offering exemption of Rule 506 of Regulation D) that is followed by a public offering (whether conducted pursuant to the registration process or one of the public offering exemptions).\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission revisit the current safe harbor with a view towards expanding its reach so as to permit a company to switch from a private to public offering without the necessity for an intervening termination of the private offering.  In addition to removing artificial barriers that do not further the disclosure purposes of the Securities Act, liberalization of Rule 152 also will permit a company to engage in \"test the waters\" offering activities among qualified investors in reliance on the private offering exemption prior to filing a registration statement.\nIn addition to the above suggestion, the Task Force concurs with commentators that a comparable safe harbor should be implemented with respect to exempt small business offerings conducted in reliance on Section 3(b) of the Securities Act that are followed by a public registered offering.  The safe harbor would provide only that an otherwise valid exempt offering need not be integrated with either a subsequent public offering or an earlier abandoned public offering.  In considering this suggestion, the Commission should consider whether or not the\n=======================START OF PAGE 42==\nsafe harbor should permit companies to start an offering as an exempt public offering and complete it as a registered offering.  In other words whether the safe harbor should allow for unfettered \"test the waters\" offering activities prior to filing of the registration statement.\nThe Task Force believes that the Commission should consider whether certain offerings that may give rise to disclosure abuses should be excluded from any of these safe harbor suggestions.  Historically, such offerings have included blind pools, blank check companies, penny stocks and direct participation investment programs.\nb.   Presumptive \"Public Offering\" Doctrine\nSince 1984, it generally has been the staff's position that the act of filing with the Commission a registration statement in connection with a non-shelf offering is deemed to be the commencement of the public offering of securities covered by that registration statement.  Consequently, a company is viewed as engaging in soliciting activity whether or not the company or other participants in the distribution in fact use the document to market securities.  As a result, companies that for valid reasons determine after making their filing with the Commission that a public offering is not feasible generally are precluded from raising capital in the private markets until the registration statement is withdrawn and the six-month safe harbor from integration that is set forth in Regulation D is satisfied.\nIn the Task Force's view, a publicly filed registration statement should not result in a per se conclusion that the company is engaging in general soliciting activities.  Rather than rely on an irrebuttable presumption, the Task Force suggests that the traditional facts and circumstances general solicitation analysis used in other contexts also be applied here.  To provide greater certainty to companies, however, the Task Force recommends that the Commission consider adopting a safe harbor that would allow a company to access the private markets while it has \"quietly\" filed a registration statement with the Commission.\nIn formulating a safe harbor, the Task Force suggests that the Commission consider the inclusion of investor protection safeguards relating to investor sophistication and the nature of the offering (e.g., has the type of offering raised investor protection concerns in the past).  Further, the structure of the safe harbor will depend in part on the Commission's regulatory response to general soliciting activities.\n=======================START OF PAGE 43==\n7.  Pending Staff Initiatives\na.   Prospectus Delivery\nThe Commission last May adopted revisions to its rules and forms and a new rule to implement two solutions to prospectus delivery issues arising in connection with the change to a T+3 clearance and settlement period (Release No. 33-7168 (May 11, 1995)).  The Task Force understands that last fall the Commission staff informally was advised of other prospectus delivery issues and currently is working to address the problem.  The Task Force further understands that this initiative is intended to address a specific identifiable problem and will not attempt to resolve the more global concern of how and when information should be provided to investors.\nRegardless of the outcome of this initiative, the Task Force recommends that the Commission consider whether there may be certain types of offerings where delivery of the mandated disclosure document prior to or with the confirm does not further the information flow to investors.  For instance, when a seasoned issuer is offering additional shares of common stock, the Commission should consider permitting full incorporation by reference into a confirmation sent to an investor; an approach also contemplated by the Advisory Committee's company registration model.  Such an approach could be based on the nature of the purchasers and/or the offering.\nb.   Offshore Press and Internet Activities\nConcerns have been expressed that journalists for publications with circulation in the U.S. have been excluded from offshore press activities conducted by foreign issuers.  Preliminary Note 7 to Regulation S states that such journalists should not be precluded from offshore press conferences, press releases and meetings with company press spokespersons in which an offshore offering or tender offer is discussed, provided that the information is made available to the foreign and U.S. press generally and is not intended to induce purchases or tenders of securities by U.S. persons.  Nonetheless, foreign issuers involved in global offerings with a public or private U.S. tranche have been concerned that U.S. press contacts would constitute \"gun jumping\" and thus improper offers under the Securities Act.  The Task Force understands that the Commission staff currently is working on a proposal to address these concerns.\nSimilar uncertainties arise when a foreign issuer involved in an offshore offering puts information about the offering up on its Internet Website that is accessible by U.S. persons.  Even though the offer is not being made to U.S.\n=======================START OF PAGE 44==\npersons, concerns have been raised that this activity might constitute an improper offer under the Securities Act.  The Task Force understands that the Commission staff currently is working on a proposal to address these concerns.\n=======================START OF PAGE 45==\nIV.  FACILITATING CAPITAL-RAISING\nThe Task Force recommendations described below are intended to streamline further procedures and practices under the current registration system.  The recommendations for seasoned issuers set forth under the \"Shelf Offerings\" caption, as well as certain other items in this Report, are substantially identical to the streamlining concepts of the \"company registration\" framework developed by the Advisory Committee.  Although the Task Force was not designed to overlap with the work of the Advisory Committee, the Task Force members have followed the work of the Advisory Committee.  The Task Force recommends almost all of the streamlining elements of company registration.  Given its original purpose, the Task Force only has sought to identify and recommend ways to streamline the regulatory process and thus only has looked at the suggestions individually.  Were the Commission to reach the next step of putting the pieces together into a comprehensive package, the Task Force recommends that the Commission consider reasonably expected investor protections consequences of any particular package.  The Task Force notes that the Advisory Committee has devoted significant time to deliberations on these issues as it assembled its complete model and has added, what the Advisory Committee intends to be, significant investor protections.\nThe Task Force anticipates that concerns likely will be raised regarding the effect the recommendations may have on the disclosure documents used by seasoned as well as smaller issuers.\nSome concerns already have been expressed regarding increased reliance on Exchange Act reports of smaller issuers.  For instance, underwriters may have reservations regarding the increased use of annual and quarterly reports to replace the type of prospectus disclosure which formerly reflected substantial investigation and input from underwriters and counsel.  With respect to seasoned issuers, underwriters and other persons having a due diligence obligation under the Securities Act may have reservations that the recommendations will frustrate further their ability to conduct such investigations by compressing further the time period between when an issuer decides to access the market and its securities are sold (sometimes no more than a couple of hours).\nThe Task Force has decided that on balance, even though concerns have been and likely will be raised on some or all of the recommendations, it made better sense to include the recommendations in the Report.  In the Task Force's view, the concerns should not be insurmountable and thus can be addressed in connection with any rulemaking initiatives the Commission undertakes.\n=======================START OF PAGE 46==\nThe Task Force believes that the Commission, in its consideration of these recommendations and any alternatives that may be suggested, should take steps to ensure that the quality of disclosure provided to investors be at least of the same quality as that provided to investors today.  The Task Force notes that improving the quality of disclosures in periodic reports is an area being considered by the Advisory Committee.\nA.   DELIVERY OF EXCHANGE ACT PERIODIC REPORTS\nEliminate Forms S-2/F-2, and permit smaller companies reporting on Forms S-1/F-1, and timely reporting for 12 months, to deliver along with their prospectuses periodic reports in lieu of restating information regarding themselves in prospectuses.\nCompanies that have been filing Exchange Act reports with the Commission (\"reporting companies\") for a three-year period and meet the other registrant criteria are eligible to register their securities offerings on Forms S-2/F-2.  Under this framework, rather than reiterating in the prospectus the company- specific information found in their Exchange Act reports, companies may incorporate by reference that information into the prospectus and physically deliver annual and interim reports with a prospectus more focused on the details of the offering.  The Task Force believes that the benefits of this delivery option should be extended to a larger group of issuers and recommends that the three-year reporting requirement be reduced to one year.\nBecause of the substantive disclosure included in today's proxy statement, the Task Force also recommends that the Commission consider expanding the information package that can be delivered to include the proxy statement.\nThis recommendation should reduce the costs of registration for approximately 4,800 smaller companies by eliminating certain printing and other costs associated with the preparation of a traditional prospectus filed as part of a registration statement on  Forms S-1/F-1.  According to statistics compiled pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, preparation time of Forms S-2/F- 2 is less than half the preparation time of Forms S-1/F-1.  Additionally, the terms of the offering, including the securities\n=======================START OF PAGE 47==\nto be offered, and the risks and benefits of investment would be highlighted since the prospectus would not restate information about the company.  For company-specific information, shareholders need only look to the annual and interim information delivered with the prospectus.  Of course, any material changes in the registrant's affairs since the end of the latest Form 10-K which were not described in subsequent Forms 10-Q would have to be discussed in the prospectus filed as part of the effective registration statement or, during the post-effective period, in a prospectus supplement.\nThis recommendation, which narrows significantly the gap between Forms S-1/F-1 and Forms S-2/F-2, would obviate the need for those two separate and distinct registration forms.  The Task Force thus recommends that Items 11 and 12 of Forms S-1/F-1 -- which relate to the information about the company -- be modified to include the voluntary delivery option for companies which have been reporting for at least one year, so that such companies have a choice of including comprehensive disclosure within the prospectus or delivering information.  Forms S-2 and F-2 then could be eliminated, a result consistent with suggestions received by the Task Force and with the streamlining recommendations contained elsewhere in this Report.\nThe advantage of delivering Exchange Act documents with the prospectus (instead of physically putting company-related information in the prospectus) also would extend to use of Form S-4 and Schedule 14A.  For exchange offers and merger proxy solicitations on that form and schedule conducted by (and for) 12-month Form S-1/F-1 registrants, use of the delivery option could mean even more savings for smaller companies.\nWhere a company distributes required documents to its shareholders, the Commission may want to consider the appropriateness of allowing existing shareholders to elect not to receive additional copies of the same information in connection with the company's offering of additional securities.  The Task Force believes that the option not to receive documents should rest with the shareholders.\nThe Task Force recognizes that this recommendation may be inconsistent with its recommendations designed to improve the readability of disclosure documents.  While implementation of this recommendation may result in registration statements that are more focused on the proposed offering, the delivery of multiple documents (e.g., the prospectus, annual report, and quarterly reports) could create a less readable and user friendly presentation than a single comprehensive prospectus.  One way to address readability concerns in these circumstances is to require a one-page guide, or \"road map,\" which would essentially be a more descriptive table of contents.  In any event, if this recommendation is implemented, the Commission should monitor\n=======================START OF PAGE 48==\ndisclosure practices to assure that the disclosure package provided to investors is readable and informative.\nThe Task Force also anticipates that concerns might be expressed regarding the quality of the disclosure in the Exchange Act reports of less-seasoned issuers.  Some concerns have been expressed regarding increased reliance on Exchange Act reports of smaller issuers.  Underwriters may have reservations regarding the increased use of annual and quarterly reports to replace the type of prospectus disclosure which today often provides the opportunity for substantial investigation and input from underwriters and counsel.  To address such concerns the Commission, in its consideration of the expanded delivery option, should take steps to ensure that the quality of disclosure provided to investors in the offering documents be at least of the same quality as that provided to investors in today's traditional prospectus.  The Task Force notes that the quality of disclosure in periodic reports and the adequacy of due diligence on such reports by underwriters and directors are areas being considered by the Advisory Committee.\nB.   SHELF OFFERINGS\nThe Task Force recommends several revisions to the shelf registration procedure so as to provide increased flexibility to a wider array of companies with respect to their capital-raising activities.  Among other things, these recommendations include: permitting delayed pricing for registrants that have been reporting for 12 months; eliminating restrictions on \"at-the-market offerings\" by seasoned Form S-3/F- 3 eligible companies; permitting a modified universal registrant procedure; and permitting short form universal shelf registration statements to include secondary resales.\n1.  Smaller Issuers\nAllow smaller companies to price the securities on a delayed basis in order to time securities offerings more effectively with opportunities in the marketplace.\nToday, smaller companies may not be able to take advantage of \"market windows\" for their securities because they are not eligible to use the Commission's shelf registration process for primary delayed offerings.  The Task Force believes that the Commission should consider providing a modified form of shelf registration procedure to smaller companies.\n=======================START OF PAGE 49==\nThe Task Force suggests that a procedure similar to Rule 430A, but without the requirement that a prospectus supplement containing pricing information be filed within 15 business days after the effective date of a registration statement, be provided to 12-month reporting companies.  No changes to either the short form registration eligibility requirements or disclosure requirements are suggested.  In short, the prospectus would be complete except with respect to pricing information permitted to be omitted under Rule 430A.  However, given that disclosure of certain terms of preferred or debt securities, such as financial covenants, may not be practicable until pricing, the Commission should consider whether some additional flexibility with respect to delayed disclosure is appropriate for such securities.  The Task Force contemplates that, like today under Rule 430A, the pricing-related information contained in the pricing supplement would be deemed part of the registration statement, and accordingly this recommendation would not change the protections afforded investors under the liability provisions of the Securities Act.\nAs a result of this recommendation, approximately 4,800 smaller companies would be able to sell their securities on a delayed and continuous basis, as long as they deliver a pricing supplement containing Rule 430A information, their base prospectus and any updating prospectus supplements.  It has been suggested that providing additional flexibility to smaller companies could result in such entities raising more capital through the public markets rather than through exempt offerings conducted in the domestic and offshore markets.\nWhile this recommendation will afford small companies time and cost savings, the Task Force appreciates concerns raised about possible adverse effects shelf registration may have on the adequacy and accuracy of disclosures provided to investors, on Commission oversight of the disclosures and on the role of underwriters in the registration process.  These concerns are similar to those raised when the shelf registration rule was first being considered on a temporary basis and was made available to any offering including an initial public offering.  One suggestion to address these concerns is to require a waiting period between the company's determination to sell its securities and the commencement of the offering, during which an underwriter could conduct a due diligence examination.  Further, certain types of offerings may give rise to disclosure abuses.  Such offerings historically have included blind pools, blank check companies, penny stocks, and direct participation investment programs.  In formulating a modified shelf rule for smaller issuers using Form S-1, the Commission therefore should consider excluding, in whole or in part, such offerings from the procedure.\n=======================START OF PAGE 50==\nMoreover, the Task Force anticipates that the registration statement and any post-effective amendment to reflect a fundamental change or to update the financial statements and other information in accordance with Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, as well as the company's periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act, would remain subject to Commission oversight through the selective review process.\n2.  Seasoned Issuers\na.   Reconsider restrictions on \"at-the- market\" shelf offerings registered by seasoned issuers on Forms S-3/F-3.\nAn \"at-the-market offering\" is an offering on a national securities exchange or through a market maker of securities for which there is an existing trading market.  For example, if a company's common stock is trading on the New York Stock Exchange and that company offers shares of common stock on or through the facilities of an exchange or to or through a market-maker otherwise than on an exchange at the then current market price, it is conducting an at-the-market offering.  The Task Force suggests that the Commission reconsider the feasibility, consistent with investor protection and orderly market concerns, of eliminating one or more of the current restrictions on an at-the-market shelf offering to make it a more useful tool for capital-raising by seasoned issuers eligible to use Forms S-3/F-3 for offerings of common stock and non- investment grade securities.\nUnder current rules, a registrant may not make an at- the-market offering on Forms S-3/F-3 unless certain conditions are met.  The conditions are that:  the amount of securities registered cannot exceed ten percent of the registrant's non- affiliate public float (i.e., the aggregate market value of the registrant's outstanding voting stock held by non-affiliates of the registrant); the securities must be sold through an underwriter or underwriters acting as principal(s) or agent(s) for the registrant; and the underwriter or underwriters must be named in the prospectus.\nConcerns have been raised as to whether elimination of any or all of the at-the-market offering requirements may have the unintended effect of impairing investor protection and contributing to disorderly markets.  These concerns are similar\n=======================START OF PAGE 51==\nto concerns raised when at-the-market offerings were initially considered by the Commission at the time that it adopted procedures for primary shelf registration.  The Task Force therefore believes that further analysis of the use of at-the- market- offerings, and reconsideration of the original concerns prompting inclusion of the restrictions on their use, particularly in light of subsequent regulatory changes, is warranted.  This review should take into account the Commission's overall experience with the shelf registration process and subsequent regulatory changes, including the proposal of the Task Force to amend the trading practices rules.\nb.   Permit companies engaging in shelf offerings to include secondary offerings without identifying the selling security holders until the time of the actual offering.\nIn 1992, the Commission adopted provisions permitting universal shelf offerings in an effort to facilitate the use of shelf registration for delayed offerings of common stock and convertible securities.  Universal shelf provisions permit registration of a dollar amount of securities without identifying the precise timing of each subsequent offering or specific amount of each class to be offered, provided the aggregate dollar amount of the securities to be offered is set forth in the registration statement.  For example, a company can register an aggregate dollar amount, identify the classes of securities covered and not allocate the specific amounts to be offered in each category.  At the time of its adoption, the Commission only contemplated use of the universal shelf for primary offerings of securities.  The Task Force does not believe that there is a need to retain that restriction and recommends that the Commission consider expansion of the universal shelf provisions to permit registration of secondary offerings.  Under this proposal, issuers would not be required to identify the selling security holders until the time of the actual offering unless such identities are known prior to the date that the initial registration statement is declared effective.\nc.   Adopt a \"universal registrant\" rule, which would enable a parent company to name itself and its majority-owned subsidiaries as possible issuers on a shelf registration statement, and defer the choice of actual issuer until the time of takedown.\n=======================START OF PAGE 52==\nIn some instances, an issuer is not in a position to determine whether it or one of its  subsidiaries will be issuing securities included on a shelf registration statement.  The Commission staff has taken a no-action position where a registrant named itself as well as its wholly-owned finance subsidiaries in a registration statement as possible issuers, so that the actual \"issuer\" could be chosen later at the time of the takedown.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission consider the need for a rule that would more broadly permit an issuer to name on a registration statement itself and one or more of its majority-owned subsidiaries as possible issuers.  This modification would eliminate pressure on multiple registrants to select prematurely the registrant, whether or not a finance or operating entity, which will be implementing the takedown from the shelf without reducing the level of significant information provided to investors.  Each registrant, however, would have to meet independently the form eligibility requirements.  Further, the financial and narrative disclosures in the registration statement would have to be complete with respect to each of the named registrants.  Depending on the structure of the offering, a separate core registration statement may be required for each registrant.  In addition, care should be taken to avoid the potential for investor confusion with respect to the issuer of the securities.\nd.   Permit a company to reallocate securities, or register a new class of securities, on a shelf registration statement by post- effective amendment.\nRule 413 requires that a registrant file a new registration statement in order to supplement its offering with additional securities.  However, the Task Force believes that the Commission should consider whether Rule 413 should be construed to preclude an issuer from either adding an additional class of securities or reallocating the securities registered on its registration statement by way of post-effective amendment.  To address possible disclosure abuses, the Commission may decide to require such post-effective amendments to be declared effective and not receive the same administrative treatment as post- effective amendments filed pursuant to Rule 462(b).  Post- effective amendments filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) to increase the size of an offering by no more than 20 percent become effective automatically upon filing with the Commission.\nFor example, a registrant originally registers one million dollars consisting of 100,000 shares of common stock priced at $5.00 per share and 100,000 shares of preferred stock\n=======================START OF PAGE 53=\nalso priced at $5.00 per share.  If some time after the registration statement is declared effective, the registrant decides to reallocate its one million dollar offering to include 50,000 shares of common stock and 150,000 shares of preferred stock, the registrant could do so by way of a post-effective amendment so long as the one million dollar offering amount is not exceeded.  Similarly, a company that has an effective one million dollar universal shelf registration statement covering senior securities may add common stock by means of a post- effective amendment so long as the one million dollar offering amount is not exceeded.  If the one million dollar offering amount is exceeded under either example, the excess amount must be registered on a new registration statement, unless the recommendation described below to permit registration of additional dollar amounts by post-effective amendment is implemented by the Commission.  Depending on the structure of the offering, this may require a separate core registration statement for each registrant.\ne.   Permit seasoned issuers to register a dollar amount without specifying the classes of securities being registered.\nUnder current Commission rules, seasoned issuers are permitted to register dollar amounts of securities provided that they identify the classes of securities covered by the registration statement for all securities they reasonably expect to issue over the ensuing two years.  Since such issuers may not determine the specific terms of the securities until the actual offering date, disclosure regarding the classes of securities being registered is often general since most of the terms typically are not known at the effective date.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission consider the feasibility of allowing such seasoned issuers to register dollar amounts without specifying the classes of securities registered.  Disclosure regarding the exact class and terms of securities to be offered would be provided at the time of the offering.  As a result, such issuers would be afforded even greater flexibility in their capital-raising efforts than under the current regulations.\nFurthermore, the Task Force recommends that such issuers be permitted to register additional dollar amounts by means of post-effective amendments rather than the current procedure of filing a new registration statement and using Rule 429 to bring up currently effective registration statements into the new registration statement.  The Commission should consider whether this is consistent with Section 6(a) of the Securities Act.\n=======================START OF PAGE 54==\nf.   Allow seasoned issuers to pay registration fees at the time securities are taken down from the shelf.\nAlthough seasoned issuers may conduct delayed offerings by taking advantage of the shelf registration procedure, they are required to pay fees to the Commission upon the initial filing of the registration statement.  As a result, issuers may be paying fees to the Commission months before they are actually offering securities to the public.\nThe Task Force suggests that the Commission consider its authority to implement a \"pay as you go\" policy pursuant to which seasoned issuers would be permitted to pay fees at the time securities are taken down from the shelf.  This would provide issuers with additional flexibility by allowing them the use of the funds required for Commission fees until the actual offering date.\nC.   FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES\nConsider clarifying what is a \"fundamental change\" to provide registrants with certainty regarding when a post-effective amendment is required.\nThe Task Force suggests that the Commission provide greater certainty with respect to what events constitute a \"fundamental change\" requiring a registrant to file a post- effective amendment to its shelf registration statement.  The Task Force recommends that the Commission set forth specific situations which would be considered a fundamental change requiring a post-effective amendment, including a change in accountants, a change in control, a change that cannot be succinctly stated in a supplement, a material acquisition or disposition, a change in the business or operations of a registrant that would require a restatement of the financial statements, or bankruptcy.\nThe undertaking to file a post-effective amendment to reflect a fundamental change applies to continuous and delayed offerings permitted under the Commission's shelf registration rule, Rule 415.  The Task Force suggests that the Commission consider requiring a post-effective amendment filing for any offering, whether or not it relates to an offering conducted under the shelf registration rule, whenever there is a fundamental change.\n=======================START OF PAGE 55==\nD.   BROKER-DEALER RESEARCH REPORTS\nConsider streamlining and modernizing the safe harbors provided in Securities Act Rules 137, 138 and 139 relating to the use of broker-dealer research reports.\nSecurities Act Rules 137 through 139 provide safe harbors for brokers and dealers who disseminate information, opinions or recommendations regarding registrants or a class of a registrant's securities.  The Task Force recommends that the Commission, consistent with investor protection, consider ways to streamline and modernize those rules to, among other things, reflect rapid advances in communications technology, globalization of the markets and other developments since these safe harbors were adopted in 1970.  For example, the Commission may wish to consider whether the current exclusion from these rules of any research report with respect to initial public offerings remains necessary for and consistent with investor protection.  The Task Force also recommends that Rule 138, which is a narrow rule relating to research reports concerning S-2/F-2 companies, be consolidated with Rule 139.\nWhile revisiting these rules, the Commission also should review certain restrictions on participating dealers publishing reports regarding companies ineligible to use  Forms S-3/F-3, such as the prohibition against publishing a more favorable opinion or recommendation than that published in their last publication.  Specifically, the Commission should consider whether these restrictions should be based upon criteria other than the form eligibility of the issuer, such as market capitalization.\nE.   MARKET-MAKING TRANSACTIONS\nEliminate an affiliated broker-dealer's prospectus delivery obligation in connection with \"regular way\" market making transactions.\nMarket-making transactions by a broker-dealer who is an affiliate of the issuer of the securities in which the broker- dealer makes a market must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. The Task Force recommends that the Commission eliminate the affiliated broker-dealer's prospectus delivery obligation that exists for \"regular way\" market-making transactions in outstanding\n=======================START OF PAGE 56==\nsecurities of a Section 12 reporting company.  The Task Force believes that under these circumstances, the burden on dealers can be reduced without sacrificing investor protections.  In implementing this recommendation, the Commission should consider whether certain offerings that traditionally have given rise to abuses should be excluded.  Historically, such offerings have included blind pools, blank check companies, penny stocks and direct participation investment programs.\nF.   AFFILIATE STATUS\nConsider revising Rule 144's definition of \"affiliate,\" consistent with Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, to exclude certain persons, such as some outside directors, who are not actually or potentially in a position to control a company's offering activities.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission consider whether the broad concept of \"affiliate\" could be narrowed to focus, consistent with Section 2(11), on persons in a position actually or potentially to control the issuer's activities.  Some critics maintain that the concept has expanded unduly over the years to cover all Section 16 insiders, regardless of actual or potential control.  The Commission may want to consider this proposal in conjunction with its consideration of the scope of \"outside directors\" for proportionate liability allocation purposes under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nUnder Rule 144(a)(1) an \"affiliate\" of an issuer includes \"a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer.\"  The Task Force believes that a broad rule subjecting secondary resales to the provisions of Rule 144, solely because of a person's status as an outside director, may not further the purposes of the Securities Act.  Individual outside directors usually are not conduits for distributions by the issuer unless they are associated with a broker-dealer.  This recommendation would not alter any other obligation of outside directors to comply with other applicable provisions of the federal securities laws, including the obligation to report holdings and transactions on Forms 3, 4, and 5 pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.\n=======================START OF PAGE 57==\nG.   TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939\nThe Task Force understands that the Commission may undertake a study of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the \"Trust Indenture Act\") to evaluate the continued effectiveness of specific provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, and to determine whether the outright repeal or fundamental revision of the Trust Indenture Act advocated by some commentators would be appropriate.  If the Commission undertakes such a study and determines that the Trust Indenture Act should be maintained, the Task Force recommends the following revisions in order to further streamline the rules promulgated under the Trust Indenture Act.\n1.  Permit a shelf registrant to qualify an indenture by post-effective amendment so that it need not file a new registration statement when adding a new class of debt securities.\nUnder Section 309(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act, indentures relating to registered debt securities are deemed to be qualified upon effectiveness of the registration statement.  Currently, there are no provisions for the post-effective qualification of indentures under the Trust Indenture Act.  However, indentures used in delayed offerings, while qualified at the time of effectiveness, frequently do not specify business terms until the actual sale of the securities at a date later than the effectiveness of the registration statement.  Under current practice, a form of indenture is qualified at the time the registration statement goes effective, with the business terms permitted to be specified in a supplemental indenture.\nWhen a registrant wishes to reallocate securities in a shelf registration statement to issue debt securities that were not included in the registration statement at the time of effectiveness, however, the registrant currently would be required to file a new registration statement in order to both reallocate the securities and to qualify a new indenture.  In another proposal, the Task Force recommends permitting registrants to reallocate securities registered on shelf registration statements by post-effective amendment.  As a follow-up to the reallocation proposal, the Task Force further recommends allowing for post-effective qualification of indentures.  As a result, registrants would be able to reallocate debt securities on a shelf registration statement by post- effective amendment.  This proposal would provide issuers with complete flexibility in reallocating registered securities.\nIn order to allow for post-effective qualification of indentures, the Task Force recommends that the Commission promulgate a rule under the Trust Indenture Act that defines when\n=======================START OF PAGE 58==\n\"registration becomes effective as to such security\" under Section 309(a)(1) for purposes of securities to be offered on a delayed basis.  Under the definitional rule, a registration statement would become effective as to securities to be offered on a delayed basis either: (i) when the registration statement becomes effective; or (ii) when a post-effective amendment containing the new form of indenture becomes effective.  As with the current system, this system could involve the qualification of the new form of indenture contained in the post-effective amendment, with the business terms specified later in a supplemental indenture.\nThe Task Force believes that allowing for post- effective qualification would not erode investor protection since the indenture still would be qualified prior to any sales of securities and all the mandatory indenture provisions under the Trust Indenture Act would be automatically incorporated into the qualified indenture as required by the 1990 amendments to the Trust Indenture Act.\n2.  Eliminate Forms T-1 and T-2 for determining trustee eligibility and, instead, require an issuer to make an \"eligible trustee\" representation in the registration statement.\nUnder Section 305(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Commission may require that certain information regarding the trustee be disclosed by the registrant in its registration statement so that the Commission can determine whether the trustee is eligible to act under Section 310(a).  Such information regarding trustee eligibility must be contained in a separate part of the registration statement and signed by the designated trustee.  Currently, the Commission requires registrants to use Forms T-1 (for a corporate trustee) and T-2 (for an individual trustee) for statements of eligibility and to file the forms as exhibits to the registration statement.  In 1994, 962 Form T-1s were filed and zero Form T-2s were filed and, in 1995, 683 Form T-1s were filed and zero Form T-2s were filed.\nThe 1990 amendments to the Trust Indenture Act substantially reduced the disclosure requirements under Forms T-1 and T-2.  Specifically, the trustee eligibility provisions were amended so that the enumerated conflicts of interest are disqualifying, and must be disclosed, only if there is a default.\nTherefore, under the post-1990 Form T-1, if no default exists, the registrant need only provide information required by Items 1, 2, 15 and 16 of the form concerning the name of the trustee, any affiliations of the trustee with the obligor, the order or rule by which a foreign trustee is authorized to act as sole trustee,\n=======================START OF PAGE 59==\nand certain exhibits relating to trustee eligibility. Similarly, under Form T-2, the registrant need only disclose a limited amount of information (Items 1 and 2) if no default exists.  However, other than the exhibits, much of the information required under Forms T-1 and T-2 where there is no default is already required to be disclosed in Securities Act registration statements as part of the description of securities.  Item 202(b)(10) of Regulation S-K requires the registrant to disclose, in part, the \"name of the trustee(s) and the nature of any material relationship with the registrant or with any of its affiliates.\"\nThe Task Force recommends that Forms T-1 and T-2 be eliminated.  In lieu of filing a statement of trustee eligibility on Form T-1 or T-2, the Task Force recommends that the registrant be required to make a representation in the registration statement that the named trustee is eligible to act under Section 310(a).  The representation would serve as part of the information used by the Commission in determining trustee eligibility rather than the information provided on Forms T-1 and T-2.  Because of the Commission's reliance on the registrant's representation, the exhibits required under the forms would no longer be necessary.  In addition, the registrant would be required to file as an exhibit to the registration statement a statement by the named trustee confirming its eligibility under Section 310(a).  Such a statement would be signed by the trustee, thereby assuring that the trustee had notice of being named as a trustee.  Further, the registrant would be able to rely on the statement of the trustee when making its representation as to the trustee's eligibility.\nIn shelf offerings, where a trustee may not be identified at the time the registration statement is filed, the registrant would be required to make a representation that the trustee will be eligible (upon selection) to act under Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act and that it will provide a statement of the trustee in accordance with Section 305(b)(2) upon selection.  Together, the representation and the trustee statement filed later would serve as the application for determining trustee eligibility, which is allowed to be filed on a delayed basis pursuant to Section 305(b)(2) for registered shelf offerings.\nAn issuer may have debt securities that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act but are nevertheless subject to the Trust Indenture Act.  For such debt securities, an issuer must file a Form T-3 in addition to the applicable trustee eligibility form.  If Forms T-1 and T-2 are eliminated, then Form T-3 should be modified so that the trustee eligibility information is provided in Form T-3.\n=======================START OF PAGE 60==\nIn addition, if Forms T-1 and T-2 are eliminated, the rules which set forth the requirements relating to the filing of the forms (Rules 5a-1 through 5a-3 and 5b-1 through 5b-3) should be eliminated.\n=======================START OF PAGE 61==\nV.        SMALL BUSINESS INITIATIVES\nThe Commission has long recognized that small businesses play a pivotal role in ensuring the vitality of the nation's economy.  Over the years, the Commission has taken numerous steps to ease the way for small businesses to access U.S. capital markets.  Among some of the most significant measures taken by the Commission were the small business initiatives in 1992.  As a result of those initiatives, the Commission adopted major revisions to its rules implementing Securities Act registration exemptions and established an integrated registration and reporting system for small business issuers.  The Task Force makes the following additional recommendations.\nA.   LOCAL OFFERING EXEMPTION\nLiberalize the local offering exemption by adding a \"substantial compliance\" provision, expanding the concept of residence for individual and business purchasers, relaxing the triple 80 percent \"doing business\" test, and shortening the resale holding period under Rule 147 while creating a new limited exemption for certain local offerings that cross state lines.\nSection 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act permits an issuer with localized business operations to sell securities exclusively to local investors without the need to register with the Commission.  The Commission promulgated Rule 147 in 1974 to provide a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11).\nOver the years, the safe harbor provided by Rule 147 appears to have been infrequently used by issuers seeking to raise capital within the borders of a single state, and critics have described the rule as unreasonably strict and narrow.\nGenerally speaking, in order to fall within the Rule's safe harbor, an issuer must offer and sell all of its securities only to persons who are resident of the same state in which the issuer is resident and doing business or, if the issuer is a corporation, in which it is incorporated and doing business.  The Commission has narrowly construed both Section 3(a)(11) and Rule 147 to mean that if any part of an issue is offered or sold to a non-resident, even if unintentionally, the entire offering is disqualified from receiving the exemption.  Even de minimis sales to non-residents trigger the disqualification.\n=======================START OF PAGE 62==\nMoreover, Rule 147 requires that, for the most recent, specified fiscal period, an issuer must have derived at least 80 percent of its gross revenues and have at least 80 percent of its assets located within the particular state.  Rule 147 further requires that an issuer use within the state at least 80 percent of the net proceeds derived from the sale of the exempted securities in order to fall within the Rule's safe harbor.  This \"triple 80 percent\" test appears to be stricter than the \"predominant amount of business\" test, which some courts have adopted to determine whether an issuer has satisfied the \"doing business\" requirement under Section 3(a)(11).  See, e.g., Chapman v. Dunn, 414 F.2d 153 (6th Cir. 1969).  The current test also appears to be stricter than the \"substantial operational activities\" test, which the Commission utilized for determining an issuer's Section 3(a)(11) eligibility prior to the enactment of Rule 147.  The Commission explained this latter test in a 1961 release, which set forth guidelines for interpreting Section 3(a)(11).  See Release No. 33-4434 (December 6, 1961).\nIndications are that, because of the strict provisions of Rule 147, issuers have utilized the local offering exemption only sparingly, if at all.  The Commission's goal should be to create a usable offering exemption for small issuers that reflects the realities of the nexus to more than one locality of today's small businesses.  Today, an individual investor often maintains more than one residence, which makes it difficult and costly for a small company to ensure that it has truly engaged in a local offering.  Further, an individual investor may be equally (or even more) familiar with companies located around his or her place of employment as those located near his or her residence.\nBecause some of the problems associated with Rule 147 stem from the statutory language of Section 3(a)(11) itself, the most expedient way to accomplish reform of the local offering exemption for small companies is for the Commission to both revise Rule 147 as much as the statute will allow and exercise its Section 3(b) authority to create an expanded local offering exemption, subject to the following guidelines.  The new Section 3(b) exemption would apply to any specified capital raising transaction that does not exceed $5,000,000.  Offerings greater than that amount would have to meet the more stringent requirements of Rule 147 and/or Section 3(a)(11).  With this two- tier approach in mind, the Task Force makes the following recommendations for an expanded offering exemption for small companies.  For each recommendation, the Task Force has noted whether it can be implemented under a revised Rule 147 exemption, a new Section 3(b) exemption, or both.\n1.  The Commission should add a \"substantial compliance\" provision similar to that contained in Rule 508 of Regulation D.  Under such a provision, an issuer would not lose the exemption for the entire offering by making an inadvertent\n=======================START OF PAGE 63==\noffer or sale to a non-resident as long as it fulfills the following requirements:  a) the issuer must have reasonably believed that the non-resident was in fact a resident; b) the number of inadvertent non-resident purchasers was de minimis; and c) the issuer must have made a good faith effort to comply with all of the Rule's provisions.  The Task Force believes that the Commission could promulgate such a \"substantial compliance\" provision when revising Rule 147 under Section 3(a)(11).  However, even if the Commission reaches a contrary determination regarding Rule 147, it should promulgate this \"substantial compliance\" provision as part of a new Section 3(b) exemption.\n2.  The Commission should clarify that the primary focus of the local offering exemption is on purchasers rather than offerees so that an issuer would not violate the rule if a non-resident inadvertently became an offeree.  This would protect an issuer that utilizes newspapers of limited, albeit general, circulation or outdated mailing lists to advertise its offering.  As the Commission has previously acknowledged in the above- referenced 1961 release interpreting Section 3(a)(11), as long as the issuer included the appropriate cautionary statements warning a prospective purchaser that the offering was limited to local residents, the mere fact that some non-residents read the advertisement or otherwise became inadvertent recipients of the solicitation would not disqualify the offering from receiving the exemption's benefits.  The Task Force believes that the Commission could implement this recommendation under Section 3(b), as well as under Section 3(a)(11).\n3.  The Commission should expand the concept of residence for the purpose of determining an eligible individual purchaser.  This would accommodate those investors that spend substantial amounts of time in more than one state.  A person should be considered a \"local\" where:  a) such person owns or leases a dwelling which is maintained as a personal residence; b) such person's principal place of employment or occupation is located; or c) such person is registered to vote.  The Commission could act on this recommendation when revising Rule 147 under Section 3(a)(11), as well as when creating a new local offering exemption under Section 3(b).\n4.  The Commission also should consider expanding the concept of residence for a corporate or other business purchaser.  Rule 147 currently restricts the residence of a corporation, partnership, trust or other business organization to the state in which its principal business office is located.  The Commission should consider expanding the \"business purchaser\" residence requirement to include any state in which the business purchaser has an office from which it operates a bona fide business enterprise, provided this is the office that handles the investment in question.  Again, the Commission could implement\n=======================START OF PAGE 64==\nthis recommendation when revising Rule 147 as well as under Section 3(b).\n5.  The Commission should change the determining factor of an issuer's residence to be the location of its principal place of business, regardless of the particular form of business organization involved.  Rule 147(c)(1)(i) currently limits the residence of a corporation, limited partnership, trust, or other form of business organization that is organized under local law, to its place of incorporation or organization.  In so doing, the Rule excludes from its scope a substantial number of business organizations that have taken advantage of another state's favorable corporate, partnership or tax laws when forming their enterprises despite maintaining their principal places of business elsewhere.  The Commission should adopt a \"principal place of business\" residence requirement for all issuers, regardless of their business form.  The Commission could implement this recommendation only under Section 3(b) since Section 3(a)(11) utilizes the term \"incorporated,\" thereby restricting the statutory exemption to a corporation that is both incorporated and doing business within the same state of residence as its offerees and purchasers.\n6.  The Commission should modify or eliminate the \"triple 80 percent\" test by which it currently determines whether an issuer is \"doing business\" to qualify for the local offering exemption under Rule 147.  The Commission should either substantially lower the threshold \"doing business\" amount under Rule 147 or eliminate it altogether and replace it with a more general \"predominant amount of business\" or \"substantial operational activities\" standard.  For example, the Commission could adopt a \"doing business\" standard that is satisfied by the issuer having earned less than 80 percent but more than 50 percent of its gross revenues and having less than 80 percent but more than 50 percent of its assets located in the particular state.  Furthermore, the Commission should consider discarding the \"use of proceeds\" portion of the \"triple 80 percent\" test.  In this regard, as long as investors have recourse to an issuer, the local offering exemption would remain available if an issuer eventually uses the proceeds of a local offering to fund an out- of-state project, but otherwise continues to meet the \"gross revenues\" and \"net asset\" requirements.  The Commission could implement this recommendation both when revising Rule 147 and proceeding under Section 3(b).\n7.  The Commission should consider permitting an issuer to claim the local offering exemption for an offering that crosses state lines in certain limited circumstances.  Such a transaction would retain its \"local\" character as long as it was confined to:  a) a metropolitan region that is recognized as a single statistical area, such as the District of Columbia- Northern Virginia-Maryland area or the New York City-Northern New\n=======================START OF PAGE 65==\nJersey-Connecticut region; or b) an area within a certain prescribed distance (e.g., 100 miles) from the issuer's principal place of business.  The Commission could implement this recommendation only pursuant to its Section 3(b) authority.\n8.  The Commission should consider relaxing the nine- month resale safe harbor for purchasers of securities issued in a local offering.  Under Rule 147, a purchaser of local offering securities cannot resell them out of state for at least nine months following the issuer's last sale of such securities.  The Task Force believes that this period may impose an unnecessary burden on the marketability of such securities.  Accordingly, the Task Force recommends that the Commission curtail the nine-month period to either 90 days or six months.  The Commission has previously utilized each of these periods as a measurement under the federal securities laws.  For example, under Section 4(3) and Rule 174, the Commission utilizes a 90-day period to determine a dealer's prospectus delivery requirements concerning the initial public offering of an issuer that is a non-reporting company and is not traded on Nasdaq.  The Commission adopted a six month period as the basis for its integration principle under Rule 147 as well as Regulation A.  The Commission could implement this \"shortened holding period\" recommendation under both Section 3(a)(11) and Section 3(b).\n9.   For purposes of safeguarding investor protection, the Commission should consider excluding offerings by \"blank check\" and \"blind pool\" business organizations and direct participation investment programs from the scope of the expanded offering exemption, whether implemented under Section 3(b) or as a revised Rule 147.\nB.   REGULATION A\nExpand the Regulation A exemption by permitting small businesses to raise five million dollars within six months rather than five million dollars per year.\nRegulation A, promulgated under Securities Act Section 3(b), provides an exemption for small offerings of up to five million dollars within a 12-month period.  However, the Commission's exemptive authority under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act is broader.  It may exempt any single offering up to an aggregate five million dollars, without any explicit limitation on the number of offerings in a given time period.  The Commission included a 12-month limitation to prevent companies from evading the spirit of the five million dollar limitation by making multiple five million dollars offerings within a short period of time (e.g., four five million dollar\n=======================START OF PAGE 66==\nofferings which really would amount to one $20 million non-exempt offering).  The Task Force believes that the 12-month limitation may not be necessary and that the scope of the exemption for Regulation A purposes should be changed from a 12-month to a 6- month period so that $10 million could be sold under the exemption annually.  Changing the limit on the ceiling in this way would assure that small businesses have more frequent access to the marketplace and can continue to play their essential role in the success of the U.S. market system.\nAlternatively, the Task Force recommends that the Commission consider revising Regulation A to permit five million dollars to be raised per offering rather than within a specific time period, applying standard integration analysis to determine when multiple offerings in fact constitute a single offering.  This approach would be consistent with a recent Commission proposal regarding a California limited offering exemption.  See Release No. 33-7185 (June 27, 1995).  In that release, the Commission proposed a new exemption from registration for limited offerings up to five million dollars that meet the qualifications of a new California exemption, regardless of whether such offerings are separated by any particular time period.  Thus, the Task Force believes that modification to an offering-by-offering rule rather than an annual ceiling would be consistent with harmonization of the federal and state regulatory scheme.\nC.   REGULATION D\nReduce the regulatory burden on nonreporting companies engaged in exempt offerings under Regulation D by permitting the use of uncertified financial statements when the offering amount is five million dollars or less.\nThe requirements in Rule 502, relating to financial statement disclosure for non-reporting companies selling securities pursuant to Rules 505 or 506 of Regulation D, are currently inconsistent with the requirements for disclosure of non-financial information.  The level of non-financial disclosure required is determined by whether the offering could alternatively be accomplished under Regulation A.  If the offering amount is five million dollars or less, the issuer must provide the same kind of information as in a Regulation A offering.  If not, the issuer must deliver the same kind of information as would be provided in a registration statement under the Securities Act on the form that the issuer would be eligible to use.\n=======================START OF PAGE 67==\nThe level of financial statement disclosure is similarly based upon the size of the offering, but does not depend upon the five million dollar Regulation A threshold.  Instead, it depends upon three levels of offering size:  a certified balance sheet is required for offerings up to two million dollars; certified financials pursuant to Regulation S-B are required for offerings from two million dollars up to $7.5 million; and certified financials as would be provided in a registration statement under the Securities Act on the form that the issuer would be entitled to use are required for offerings over $7.5 million.  The last two disclosure categories need not be satisfied if that information cannot be obtained without unreasonable effort or expense in which event only an audited balance sheet need be provided.  In addition, financial and non- financial information is required to be furnished to a purchaser only to the extent material to an understanding of the issuer, its business and the securities being offered.\nIn 1992, as part of the Commission's small business initiatives, the Commission considered revising the financial information requirements of Rule 502 to eliminate the requirement for certified financial statements, regardless of the size of the offering.  This proposal was not received favorably and was never adopted.  The Task Force recommends that the Commission consider a similar, more limited, revision to the financial information requirements.  Specifically, the Task Force recommends conforming the financial information requirements to the rule's non- financial requirements so that offerings below five million dollars could contain uncertified financial statements.  This recommendation also would simplify preparation of Regulation D offerings by eliminating the two different schemes for financial and non-financial disclosure.\n=======================START OF PAGE 68==\nVI.       SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS\nA.   WILLIAMS ACT AND PROXY RULES\n1.  Consider the creation of an integrated regulation for mergers, tender offers and other extraordinary transactions.\nTo promote uniform disclosure practices among similar types of transactions, the Task Force recommends that the Commission consider creating a new regulation integrating the transactional disclosure requirements of Forms S-4 and F-4 (form for registration of securities issued in mergers, exchange offers and other business combination transactions), Schedules 14A (proxy solicitations), 14C (information statements), 13E-3 (going-private transactions), 13E-4 (issuer tender offers) and 14D-1 (third party tender offers).  Much like Regulation S-K, the regulation should standardize, where appropriate, the type of disclosure among different forms of such extraordinary transactions.  The Task Force believes that integration would eliminate the redundancies that currently exist by having the same disclosure item appear in the different forms and schedules where the investment and/or voting decision confronting shareholders is essentially the same.  This approach also would facilitate greater uniformity in the disclosure disseminated to investors.\nIn formulating the new regulation, the Task Force also recommends that the Commission consider the following additional revisions.  These recommendations also should be considered independently if the Commission determines not to establish a new integrated disclosure regulation:\na.   Revise proxy statement disclosure requirements.\nThe disclosure requirements of proxy statements regarding mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and similar matters are contained in Items 11 through 14 of Schedule 14A.  Item 11 sets forth disclosure requirements regarding authorization or issuance of securities otherwise than for exchange.  Item 12 sets forth disclosure requirements regarding modification or exchange of securities.  Item 13 sets forth financial and other information requirements for transactions pursuant to Items 11 and 12.  Item 14 sets forth disclosure requirements regarding mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and similar matters in proxy statements.\nThe Task Force recommends that Items 11 through 14 of Schedule 14A be substantially revised and simplified, and that\n=======================START OF PAGE 69==\nconforming changes be made to Form S-4 to the extent that it contains substantially similar language and the Form S-4 proxy/prospectus procedure is not used.  This recommendation is intended to clarify and simplify current rules, not to suggest that substantive modifications be effected.\nb.   Clarify the treatment of cash mergers.\nItem 14 of Schedule 14A addresses the disclosure requirements for cash mergers in a complex instruction.  Since very little, if any, information is necessary regarding the acquiring company in cash mergers, the Task Force recommends that Item 14 be revised to make clear that information regarding the acquiror in cash mergers is only necessary if it is material to the voting securityholder's evaluation of the proposed transaction.  Such material information would include, for example, information about the acquiror's financial ability to satisfy the terms of the offer, or potential conflicts of interest between the management of the target company and that of the acquiring company.\nc.   Combine Schedules 13E-4 and 14D-1.\nDue to the substantial similarities between the disclosure required for issuer tender offers (Schedule 13E-4) and third party tender offers (Schedule 14D-1), the Task Force believes that benefits may be achieved by combining the Schedules into a uniform tender offer schedule.  One major difference between the two schedules concerns their respective financial disclosure requirements.  In certain respects, a Schedule 13E-4 filer must disclose more financial information than a Schedule 14D-1 bidder.  These financial disclosure differences should not pose an obstacle to merger of the two schedules.\nSimilarly, the Commission should consider merging Schedules 13E-4F and 14D-1F together.  These Schedules pertain, respectively, to issuer and third party tender offers involving certain Canadian companies.  The eligibility criteria and the disclosure requirements are substantially similar for both Schedules.\nd.   Move substantive disclosure requirements out of rules and into schedules.\nSome of the disclosure requirements for tender offers are set forth in the tender offer rules, while the balance of such requirements are included in Schedules 14D-1 and 13E-4.  For example, Rule 14d-6(e) requires disclosure of (i) the scheduled expiration date of the tender offer and information regarding extension of that date, and (ii) information with regard to\n=======================START OF PAGE 70==\nwithdrawal rights.  The Task Force believes that this dispersion of disclosure requirements is unduly confusing.  Therefore, the Task Force recommends consolidation of all such disclosure requirements in the new integrated regulation or, if such regulation is not adopted, in the schedules.\nThe Task Force also recommends that any disclosure requirements for proxy statements contained in the rules rather than in Schedule 14A similarly be moved into that schedule (e.g., the date by which shareholder proposals must be submitted for inclusion in a company's proxy statement, which requirement is now in Rule 14a-5).\n2.  Reduce the disclosure obligations for an investor with a passive investment purpose, who acquires or holds more than five percent but less than a certain percentage of a company's equity securities, by allowing such an investor to file a short form Schedule 13G rather than a Schedule 13D report.\nWith certain exceptions, Exchange Act Section 13(d) and the regulations promulgated thereunder require a beneficial owner of more than five percent of a class of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file a Schedule 13D report with the Commission within ten days after it has exceeded the five percent threshold.  The purpose of Section 13(d)'s reporting regimen is to function as an early warning system to the company, its shareholders and the markets about a potential change in control of the company.\nHowever, the scope of the Section 13(d) reporting scheme may place an unnecessary reporting obligation on persons whose acquisitions have a passive investment purpose and thus do not involve the concerns of the Williams Act.  Consequently, the Task Force recommends the following Regulation 13D revisions.\na.   Permit investors with passive investment intent to use Schedule 13G.\nThe Commission should amend Regulation 13D to permit any investor, whether institutional or non-institutional, that acquires or holds more than five percent but less than a certain percentage (e.g., 10, 15 or 20 percent) of a class of Section 13(d) securities with a passive investment purpose, to file a Schedule 13G instead of a Schedule 13D.  Schedule 13G is the \"short form\" Section 13(d) report, which primarily applies to certain qualifying institutional investors.  Schedule 13G only requires minimum disclosure of certain basic items of information\n=======================START OF PAGE 71==\nconcerning the beneficial owner's identity and a description of the securities interest in question, and need only be filed within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year in which the threshold is exceeded.  While the Commission proposed a similar amendment to Regulation 13D in 1989, it has not acted on this proposal.\nThe Task Force therefore recommends that the Commission revisit the 1989 proposing release and renew the debate on these issues.  In determining the best method to implement this recommendation, the Task Force recognizes that the Commission may wish to take into account its intervening liberalization of the proxy rules in 1992, particularly reliance that was placed in that context upon the beneficial ownership rules.  Also, in determining the appropriate beneficial ownership ceiling, the Commission again should seek comment on the level of holdings that would implicate a controlling interest.\nb.   Codify staff position permitting control persons of institutional investors to file jointly with such institutional investors on Schedule 13G under certain conditions.\nInstitutional investors who, as part of the ordinary management of their investment portfolios, acquire securities representing more than five percent of a class of equity securities are required under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act to file reports indicating their beneficial ownership with the Commission.  If these securities were acquired with neither the purpose nor effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer, and not in connection with nor as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect, the institutional investor is eligible to report the acquisition on Schedule 13G.\nAlthough persons controlling such institutional investors also are considered under Commission rules to be beneficial owners of those securities, such persons are generally not eligible to avail themselves of the short form reporting privilege.  Nevertheless, the staff has taken the position in no- action letters that such control persons may file jointly with the institutional investors on the short form report, provided that such control persons' individual ownership (i.e., ownership other than that which is attributable to the person by virtue of their relationship with the institutional investor) does not exceed one percent of the class of the issuer's equity securities.  The Task Force recommends the codification of this staff position.\n=======================START OF PAGE 72==\n3.  Exemptive Order For Multinational Tender Offers\nIn 1991, the Commission issued a release proposing rules, forms and an order that would permit tender offers (cash or exchange) to proceed in the United States on the basis of the applicable regulation of the target company's home jurisdiction, where 10 percent or less of the class of securities sought in the tender or exchange offer is held of record by U.S. holders.  See Release No. 34-29275 (June 5, 1991).  No action has yet been taken by the Commission on such proposal.  The Task Force has not included a specific recommendation in this Report regarding the treatment of multinational tender offers because it understands that the Commission's staff is actively working on a rulemaking proposal relating to certain of these offerings.  The Task Force anticipates that in reviewing the staff's proposal, the Commission would balance carefully the need to encourage foreign issuers to extend offshore offerings to U.S. shareholders with the adequacy of the bidder's home-country disclosure requirements.\n4.  Consider permitting direct mailing of proxy soliciting materials to non-objecting beneficial owners of voting securities held of record by brokers, banks and other intermediaries.\nIn 1992, the Commission adopted extensive revisions to the proxy rules in order to alleviate regulatory burdens on shareholder communications.  In view of ongoing technological and other developments in shareholder communications, including possible changes in applicable state law and stock exchange requirements that overlap with the Commission's proxy regulations in this area, the Task Force recommends that the Commission consider whether an additional revision is warranted to permit companies to mail proxy soliciting materials relating to a shareholder vote directly to non-objecting beneficial owners of voting securities held of record on their behalf by brokers, banks and other intermediaries (collectively referred to as \"NOBOs\").  For example, some recently amended state corporation laws and the Revised Model Corporation Act have introduced a concept of consenting beneficial holders who can be recognized as shareholders for some purposes (e.g., receipt of notices).  However, the current Commission rules permit direct company mailing (or electronic delivery) to NOBOs of all communications except proxy soliciting materials (or information statements).  Only if the company is willing to incur the additional cost and other burdens attendant to mailing (or otherwise transmitting) the same set of materials twice -- both to the record holders and the NOBOs -- is direct transmission of proxy and other soliciting materials permissible.  Of course, some mechanism (such as use of\n=======================START OF PAGE 73==\nan omnibus proxy) would have to be developed by the Commission to ensure compliance with applicable state-law voting requirements.\n5.  Consider eliminating filing of preliminary proxy statements in contested elections of directors.\nConsistent with the Commission's previous efforts to liberalize the regulatory scheme pertaining to proxy solicitations, the Task Force recommends that the Commission permit most Schedule 14A proxy statements filed in connection with an election contest to be filed in definitive form immediately upon use.  This change is consistent with the current rules in that issuers and other soliciting parties currently are allowed to use all other soliciting material immediately upon filing with the Commission.  Soliciting parties also are permitted to disseminate preliminary proxy statements immediately so long as such material is not accompanied by a proxy card.  This recommendation may not be appropriate where there is a significant inequality of resources among the parties to the election contest.  One approach to address this concern would be for the Commission to identify an appropriate threshold based on the target company's unaffiliated market float, below which the contestants' proxy statements would not be afforded such treatment.  The Task Force believes that shareholders of these target companies under the threshold may benefit from staff review of preliminary proxy material.\n6.  Study the shareholder proposal process.\nFew areas of the federal securities laws have been as contentious as shareholder proposals under Exchange Act Rule 14a- 8.  The Rule, first adopted in 1942, provides a federal framework for shareholders to submit proposals to a vote of their fellow shareholders where otherwise appropriate under state law.  Under the rule, public companies generally must include proposals that meet this (and several other criteria) in proxy statements sent to all shareholders at no cost to the shareholder proponent.  This provides a low cost mechanism for shareholders to communicate with one another regarding proposals they plan to raise at the meeting, using the company's proxy statement as a vehicle.\nThe contention arises in two primary areas:  (1) what proposals should be included; and (2) what efficiencies should be added to the process.  Although the debate dates back over 20 years, it seemingly has intensified as issuer groups complain that Rule 14a-8 has become a vehicle for shareholder groups to conduct referenda on social issues that many companies believe are not relevant to their business.  Although the proposal and\n=======================START OF PAGE 74==\nsupporting statements are limited by rule to 500 words, some issuers (typically those that receive a number of proposals) argue that the cost of inclusion of these proposals outweighs any benefit to the shareholder body at large.  Activist shareholder proponents, particularly proponents of social issues, counter that it is a fundamental right of shareholders to submit proposals for consideration and that major social issues (e.g., affirmative action or doing business in particular countries) are of importance to shareholders and have an impact on the company's profitability.  Criticism, however, is not limited to the area of social proposals.  In general, shareholders acknowledge the value of the rule in addressing issues of corporate governance.\nThe Task Force considered many possibilities, including raising the thresholds for submitting a proposal; removing the exclusion for ordinary business; revisiting the personal grievance exclusion; raising the threshold for resubmitting a proposal from the prior year that did not garner much support; imposing a reasonable ceiling on the number of proposals that must be included in a single proxy statement; and turning the entire process of determining which shareholder proposals should be included in a proxy statement over to the individual states.  Unfortunately, no attempt at compromise appeared to address adequately the concerns of both proponents and issuers.  In order to find a complete solution, the Task Force believes the Commission will need to undertake a formal and in-depth study of the entire shareholder proposal process.  In the interim, however, the Commission may wish to consider suggestions received by the Task Force in favor of raising the threshold for resubmissions while at the same time considering added flexibility.\nB.   EXCHANGE OFFERS\n1.  Place certain seasoned issuer exchange tender offers on the same footing as cash tender offers by permitting such issuers' registration statements to go effective automatically upon filing.\nUnder the current regulatory scheme, bidders are not required to submit cash tender offer documents for Commission staff review prior to commencement of an offer.  The tender offer statement is filed with the Commission on the same day the tender offer is commenced.  However, if the tender offer consideration involves the issuance of bidder securities, a bidder must file a\n=======================START OF PAGE 75==\nregistration statement and await its effectiveness prior to commencing the tender offer.\nTo place exchange tender offers on an equal footing with all-cash offers, the Task Force recommends that registration statements on Forms S-4/F-4 relating to exchange tender offers by S-3/F-3 eligible companies become automatically effective upon filing, so long as the securities offered are common stock traded on a national securities exchange or quoted in Nasdaq NMS, or are investment grade debt or preferred stock.  However, automatic effectiveness would not be available for going-private or roll-up transactions.\nSimilar to cash offers, exchange tender offer filings still would be reviewed by the staff during the pendency of the tender offer.\nAlternatively, the Commission should consider allowing shareholders to tender during the period between filing and effectiveness of the registration statement.  This alternative assumes withdrawal rights during at least the waiting period and at most through the pendency of the offer and any extension thereof.\n2.  In registration statements relating to exchange offers or other acquisitions involving nonreporting target companies, require only financial information about the target company that the target company has provided to its shareholders.\nIn exchange offers or other acquisitions involving nonreporting target companies, audited financial statements of the target may not be readily available.  The Task Force believes that it represents an unreasonable burden to require acquirors to obtain audited financials for the target when it is the target company's shareholders themselves who will be the recipients of the information.  The target shareholders made an initial investment decision in the target, and then continued to hold the target's shares, without the benefit of audited financial statements.  The Task Force cannot identify any significant reason why the target shareholders should receive more and different information about their company in this context than they received prior to the exchange offer.\nBuilding on positions previously taken by the Commission staff, the Task Force recommends that the Commission require acquirors to provide only the financial information that the target has previously provided to its shareholders.  As part of this recommendation, acquirors also would no longer be required to provide a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP of the\n=======================START OF PAGE 76=\nfinancial statements of nonreporting foreign private issuers, unless such a reconciliation was already available.  This recommendation would not alter any of the existing requirements to provide pro forma financial information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X.  In addition, it would not alter any of the existing requirements to provide audited financial statements pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X if a registration statement on Form S-4 is used for resales to the public by any person who with regard to the securities being reoffered is deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Rule 145(c).  Furthermore, the disclosure requirements in proxy statements when the acquiror's shareholders are voting would remain the same.  This recommendation also would not apply to roll-up transactions.\n=======================START OF PAGE 77==\nVII.      REGISTRATION\nA.   INTERNAL REORGANIZATIONS\n1.  Exempt certain internal holding company reorganizations from registration so long as the reorganization is the sole purpose of the transaction and fundamental shareholder rights and interests remain substantially unchanged.\nA typical internal holding company reorganization is a corporate restructuring where a holding company is created to be a parent to a pre-existing operating company and shares in the pre-existing company are exchanged pro-rata for shares in the holding company.  Companies carry out such reorganizations for a variety of reasons, such as facilitation of acquisitions, joint ventures, financing and tax planning.\nUnder current rules, most internal holding company reorganizations, even reorganizations that do not alter important shareholder rights, must be registered under the Securities Act.  As Rule 145 is currently written, the issuance of securities in connection with a merger that requires a shareholder vote must be registered.  Rule 145 deems such transactions to involve an \"offer\" or \"sale\" of securities under Section 2(3) of the Securities Act.  Most holding company reorganizations involve a merger between the pre-existing company and a shell company and require shareholder approval.\nThe Task Force recommends permitting unregistered internal holding company reorganizations, so long as the reorganization is the sole purpose of the transaction, and fundamental shareholder rights and interests are substantially unchanged.  In these circumstances, there may well be no \"offer\" or \"sale\" of a new security under Section 2(3) of the Securities Act, and therefore no registration requirement under Section 5 of that Act.  Shareholders receive shares which, in reality, represent substantially the same interests and carry the same rights as those held prior to the reorganization.  To implement this recommendation, the Task Force suggests revising Rule 145 to remove internal holding company reorganizations from the description of covered transactions subject to registration.\nThis recommendation is consistent with the theory apparently underlying recently enacted legislation in Delaware and Pennsylvania that permits internal holding company reorganizations to be carried out without shareholder approval or the availability of appraisal rights, so long as certain conditions -- evidently designed to ensure continuity of\n=======================START OF PAGE 78==\nshareholder rights and interests -- are satisfied.  The recommendation also is consistent with recent staff interpretive letters involving reorganizations carried out pursuant to the new Delaware and Pennsylvania laws.  In the recent interpretive letters, the Division agreed that no \"offer\" or \"sale\" would be involved so long as certain additional conditions are met, including, among others, that shareholders will receive shares of the same class evidencing the same proportional interest in the holding company as they held in the pre-existing company and the rights and interests of the shareholders in the new holding company stock will be substantially the same as their rights and interests prior to the transaction.  The factors cited in these recent letters would serve as a basis in formulating the proposed new rule.\nThe Task Force understands that the recent enactment of Section 3(a)(12) under the Securities Act, providing a transaction exemption for certain bank holding company reorganizations, may raise issues relating to the implementation of this recommendation.  These issues should be addressed in the rulemaking process.\n2.  Ease financial disclosure requirements for internal holding  company reorganizations that are subject to registration.\nAdditional recommendations relating to holding company reorganizations follow.\nAccounting Change\nWhen the registrant is a successor to an ongoing business for which audited financial statements have been provided for the periods specified in Rules 3-01 and 3-02 of Regulation S-X, the Task Force recommends revising Rule 3-01(a) of Regulation S-X to eliminate the requirement that the successor provide an audited balance sheet as of a date within 135 days of the date of effectiveness of the registration statement.\nModification of Disclosure Requirements of Form S-4\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission codify the staff's position that an issuer engaged in a holding company reorganization may omit from its proxy statement/prospectus filed as part of a registration statement on Form S-4 the financial and other information analogous to that information which may be omitted pursuant to Instruction 4 to Item 14 of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act.  The required information would thus be largely limited to information about the reorganization itself.\n=======================START OF PAGE 79==\nB.   SPIN-OFFS\nCodify a rule permitting certain unregistered spin-offs of subsidiaries or divisions by reporting companies.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission codify the staff position stated in a series of no-action letters that certain non-abusive spin-offs of subsidiaries or divisions of companies reporting under the Exchange Act may be effected without registration under the Securities Act, so long as the marketplace is provided with sufficient information about the entity to be spun-off.  Specifically, the Task Force recommends that the Commission adopt a rule to permit unregistered spin-offs of subsidiaries of reporting issuers where shareholders receive information substantially similar to information contained in Schedule 14A or 14C, and the spun-off company registers under the Exchange Act prior to the distribution (or in the case of a foreign private issuer, provides home country information under Rule 12g3-2(b)).  Consistent with the current line of no-action positions, this relief would not be available (a) in those situations where the securities being spun-off are \"restricted securities\" (as defined in Rule 144(a)(3)) that were acquired from a third-party within the prior three years; or (b) for spin- offs lacking a valid business purpose.  The Commission staff receives numerous no-action requests in this subject area each year.  This recommendation would save registrants the time and expense spent preparing those requests and permit Commission staff to reallocate the time spent processing such requests to other matters.\nC.   EXCHANGE OFFERINGS\n1.  Broaden the circumstances in which the guaranteed convertible securities of a wholly owned subsidiary can be exchanged for those of its parent without the expense and delay of registration.\nSection 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act provides for an exemption from registration for certain exchanges by an issuer with its existing security holders.  Often, Section 3(a)(9) exempts the issuance of securities underlying convertible securities.  However, since this exemption requires that both the security issued and the security exchanged be those of the same issuer, the availability of the exemption to wholly-owned subsidiaries that issue convertible securities guaranteed by the\n=======================START OF PAGE 80==\nparent and convertible into the securities of the parent has been unclear.\nThe Task Force recommends building on, and broadening, a staff no-action position with respect to when two such issuers can be considered the same issuer for purposes of Section 3(a)(9).  This recommendation could be implemented by modifying Securities Act Rule 149 to define the term \"exchanged by the issuer with its existing security holders exclusively\" under Section 3(a)(9) to include convertible securities issued by a wholly-owned subsidiary when such securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent and convertible into securities of the parent.  The Task Force also recommends that conforming changes be made to the Rule 144 tacking provision consistent with staff no-action relief.\n2.  Codify staff positions permitting certain unregistered issuances of securities pursuant to Securities Act Section 3(a)(10) that have been subject to judicial or administrative review and approval.\nSection 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for securities issued in exchange for other securities, claims or property interests, where the issuance has been approved by a court or by an authorized federal or state administrative body following a hearing on the fairness of the terms and conditions of the proposed issuance at which all persons to whom securities are proposed to be issued has the right to appear.  The Task Force suggests that the Commission consider the appropriateness of a rule codifying the staff's position that (1) the term \"any court\" in Section 3(a)(10) includes foreign courts; (2) the court or administrative body must specifically consider the fairness of the terms and conditions of the exchange to the persons to whom securities are to be issued in the exchange, and (3) in making its fairness determination the court or administrative body must have sufficient information before it to determine the value of both the securities, claims or interests to be surrendered and the securities to be issued in the proposed transaction.  Consistent with the staff's position, the exemption would not be available in connection with class action litigation settlements where the fairness hearing occurs prior to the time the court is provided with all terms of the settlement payment formula, and with information as to the number of persons participating in the settlement and the value of their individual claims against the issuer.\n=======================START OF PAGE 81==\nD.   AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS\nEliminate the requirement to register under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act American Depositary Receipts registered on Securities Act Form F-6.\nUnder current rules, American Depositary Receipts (\"ADRs\") that are traded on the Nasdaq stock market or in the over-the-counter market generally are exempt from the Exchange Act registration and reporting requirements applicable to the deposited securities.  ADRs that are listed on a national securities exchange are, however, subject to such requirements, as are the deposited securities to which they relate.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission eliminate Exchange Act registration for the latter category of ADRs.  In these circumstances, Exchange Act registration imposes a regulatory burden with no apparent benefit to investors, since it results in no additional disclosure and creates an unwarranted distinction between Nasdaq-traded ADRs and exchange-listed ADRs.\n=======================START OF PAGE 82==\nVIII.     REPORTING\nA.   SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS\n1.  Expand the circumstances in which companies may terminate registration under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.\nA company is required under Exchange Act Section 12(g) and Rule 12g-1 to register a class of its equity securities under the Exchange Act, thus incurring periodic reporting and other obligations under that Act, if it has 500 record holders and total assets exceeding five million dollars at the end of its fiscal year.  Once registered, however, unless the number of holders drops below 300, a company cannot terminate its registration until it has fallen below both the five million dollar asset threshold and the 500 holder threshold.  That is, even though there is no initial registration obligation unless both thresholds are met, a company may not terminate its registration even if it falls below one of them.  In the case of the asset threshold, it could not terminate its registration unless its total assets have fallen below five million dollars on the last day of each of the most recent three fiscal years.  The latter requirement helps to ensure that a decline in total assets below the threshold has some permanence.\nThe Task Force suggests that the Commission revisit the rule relating to the termination of Exchange Act registration to consider whether companies should be permitted to terminate reporting when they fall below only one, but not both, of the thresholds.  The Task Force also recommends that the requirement that the value of assets fall below five million dollars on the last day of each of the most recent three fiscal years be revised to require that assets fall below that amount on the last day of each of the most recent two fiscal years.  A two-year history should in most cases be sufficient to ensure that a company's eligibility for de-registration is firmly established.\nThis suggestion seems consistent with the theory that only companies that meet both thresholds are large enough to be subject to compulsory registration, reporting and other obligations under Exchange Act.  After all, companies are not considered large enough to be subject to an initial obligation to register until both the assets and holders thresholds are met.  A company that no longer meets one of the thresholds should therefore be entitled to opt-out of registration.  On the other hand, investors buying equity of reporting companies may do so with the expectation that they will continue to be public\n=======================START OF PAGE 83==\ncompanies subject to the full regulatory scheme of the Exchange and Williams Acts.\nAdditionally, it has been brought to the attention of the Task Force that some companies which had previously registered under the Exchange Act when the asset thresholds were lower are effectively prevented from exiting the system, even though they would not under current rules have an obligation to register in the first place because they have five million dollars or less in assets.  (The Commission increased the asset threshold from one million dollars to three million dollars in 1982, and from three million dollars to the current five million dollars in 1986.  The Commission has recently proposed to raise the asset threshold to ten million dollars.)  The revision proposed by the Task Force would permit such companies with less than five million dollars of total assets or less than 500 holders of record to terminate their registrations.\nIn making this recommendation, and the recommendation below to make similar modifications to the rules relating to the suspension of an issuer's reporting obligations under the Exchange Act Section 15(d), the Task Force is aware of the outstanding proposal to raise the thresholds for termination of registration, and suspension of reporting obligations, from five million dollars to ten million dollars.  See Release No. 33-7186 (June 27, 1995).  It is not the intention of the Task Force to recommend that the Commission implement both the outstanding proposal and its own recommendations.  In the event that the Commission adopts the outstanding proposal, it should carefully evaluate the combined effect of that adoption and the Task Force's recommendations.\n2.  Similarly revise the rules governing when companies may suspend Section 15(d) reporting obligations.\nIn connection with Exchange Act Rule 12h-3 governing suspension of reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Task Force recommends expanding the circumstances in which companies may suspend their Section 15(d) reporting obligations.  Since the rules governing the suspension of Section 15(d) reporting obligations are substantially similar to the rules governing the termination of Section 12 registration, the Task Force recommends making the same revisions to Rule 12h-3 as to Rule 12g-1 described above.\n3.  Promulgate a rule pursuant to Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act permitting the modification of periodic reporting\n=======================START OF PAGE 84==\nobligations for certain companies in bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIn 1972, the Commission stated that the staff would consider providing certain companies subject to bankruptcy proceedings relief from Exchange Act reporting on a case-by-case basis.  See Release No. 34-9660 (June 30, 1972).  The Task Force recommends that the Commission adopt a limited exemptive rule, pursuant to Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act, covering companies in bankruptcy that satisfy certain conditions.  Such a rule would, in most cases, eliminate the requirement that registrants consult with the staff before modifying their reporting obligation during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding.\nAny exemptive rule largely should track the pre- conditions for relief set forth in current no-action letters, such as the preparation of Exchange Act reports involving unreasonable effort or expense (in light of the curtailment of the company's operations), the company's securities being minimally traded, exchange-traded securities being de-listed, and the company's preparation of periodic reports under the supervision of a trustee or other court-appointed officer and undertaking to file such reports with the Commission on Form  8-K.  Consistent with the no-action letters, the relief would be limited to the time that the company is in bankruptcy.  Upon emerging from bankruptcy, the company would resume its full Exchange Act reporting obligations.  In addition, in any future filings under the Securities Act, the company would have to provide audited financial statements for any period for which audited financial statements are required under the Securities Act, even though some portion of such periods might cover the period during which the company was in bankruptcy.\nThe Commission staff has provided similar relief to certain liquidating trusts, such as trusts created in connection with companies that are winding down after filing articles of dissolution with their states of incorporation.  The new rule also should provide relief to such liquidating trusts.\nThe proposed new rule should not cover certain situations that the Task Force believes may involve potential for abuse, such as liquidating trusts established in connection with real estate limited partnerships or trusts designed to cover anticipated environmental or other liabilities.\n4.  Re-examine periodic reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act to ensure that such obligations are more closely aligned with the period during which securities are actually sold.\n=======================START OF PAGE 85==\nSection 15(d) of the Exchange Act states that an issuer that has filed a registration statement under the Securities Act that has become effective is subject to Exchange Act reporting obligations.  The Task Force recommends that the Commission revisit periodic reporting requirements under Section 15(d) in order to provide clarification and avoid possible anomalous interpretations that may be inconsistent with the purposes of the Section.\nA reporting obligation under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act commences at the time a registration statement under the Securities Act becomes effective.  Although a company may postpone its offering for market, business or other legitimate reasons, it has a reporting obligation even though no securities have been sold.  In the Task Force's view, this reporting obligation should commence instead at the earlier of the time securities are sold or when-issued trading commences.  Therefore, the Commission should consider revising its rules to implement this \"springing\" reporting obligation approach.  Registrants, of course, could restart their Securities Act offering only with a current prospectus.\nThe Commission may also wish to consider other possible alternatives to ensure that reporting obligations are more closely aligned with the period during which securities are actually sold.  One alternative would be to require that certain registrants with effective registration statements remain subject to reporting obligations for a fixed period of time following de- registration of their securities.\nWhile these recommendations would likely ease the regulatory burdens on some registrants, they may in some respects increase the burdens on others.  The Task Force believes that they deserve consideration in light of other recommendations contained in this Report to extend some shelf registration concepts to smaller issuers and the importance of maintaining information in the marketplace during the time period that securities are offered and sold.\nB.   CONCURRENT EXCHANGE ACT/SECURITIES ACT REGISTRATION\n=======================START OF PAGE 86==\n1.  Permit a company to register concurrently a public offering under the Securities Act and a class of securities under the Exchange Act by filing a single form that would cover both registrations.\nUnder current rules, a reporting company can register a class of securities under the Exchange Act on a short form registration statement, Form 8-A.  A company registering an initial public offering is permitted to use Form 8-A even though it is not technically subject to reporting until after its first Securities Act registration.  Form 8-A is a short form registration form that requires only a description of the registrant's securities pursuant to Item 202 of Regulation S-K and the filing of certain exhibits.\nRegistrants who are concurrently registering securities under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act must file two forms, Form 8-A and the appropriate Securities Act form.  Since the Securities Act form will contain or incorporate by reference all of the information called for by Form 8-A, the Task Force recommends that the Commission dispense with the requirement to file Form 8-A.  In order to provide for registration under the Exchange Act, Forms S-1/F-1, S-2/F-2 (if not eliminated as recommended), S-3/F-3 and S-4/F-4 should be modified to include a box on the cover page of the registration statement that could be checked to indicate when concurrent Exchange Act registration is being made, and to include certain other information, such as title of the class of securities to be registered.\nConcurrent registration would not, however, be available for a universal shelf registration statement since that document normally does not include an adequate description of the securities for the purposes of Exchange Act registration.\nThe Task Force also recommends that the Commission consider providing a procedural mechanism for automatically registering securities issued on a shelf takedown, such as by checking a box on Rule 424 prospectuses.\nC.   SECURITIES ACT FORM ELIGIBILITY\n1.  Permit a company to switch to a shorter Securities Act form at the time of filing any amendment if it has become eligible to use the shorter form since filing its initial registration statement.\nPursuant to Rule 401 of Regulation C, the form and content of a registration statement and prospectus are determined\n=======================START OF PAGE 87==\non the initial filing date of such registration statement and prospectus.  A company is not permitted under Rule 401 to reevaluate its status until it files an amendment pursuant to Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act.  This means that, even if a company meets the eligibility criteria to use a shorter form at the time of a pre-effective or post-effective amendment, current rules require it to file the amendment on the longer form that applied at the time of its initial registration statement.\nThe Task Force believes that a company should be permitted to take advantage of a form if it meets the eligibility criteria for that form at the time it files an amendment.  Therefore, the Commission should permit companies to determine the appropriate form upon filing any amendment, whether it is a pre-effective amendment or a post-effective amendment.  When filing an amendment other than for the purposes of Section 10(a)(3), a company would not be required to revert to a more comprehensive form than the one used for its initial registration statement.\n2.  Exclude automatically effective registration statements on Form S-8 from the general rule that filings are deemed to be on the proper form unless objection is raised by the Commission prior to effectiveness.\nParagraph (g) of Rule 401 provides that a registration statement or amendment is deemed to be filed on the proper form unless the Commission objects to the form prior to the effective date of the registration statement or amendment.  To prevent abuses of this rule, the Task Force recommends that the Commission consider excluding registration statements on Form S- 8, which are automatically effective upon filing.  Since there is no time period between filing and effectiveness, the Commission does not have an opportunity to object to the form.  Thus, the appropriateness of the form should not be governed by the effectiveness of the Form S-8 registration statement.\n=======================START OF PAGE 88==\nIX.       DISCLOSURE GENERALLY\nA.   ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nEliminate the $100,000 \"one size fits all\" materiality standard for certain environmental legal proceedings and replace it with a general materiality standard to ensure that companies will not be required to disclose non-material information.\nInstruction 5 to Item 103 of Regulation S-K provides guidance in connection with the disclosure of environmental proceedings.  Instruction 5(A) directs the disclosure of a proceeding that is material to the business or financial condition to the registrant.  Instruction 5(B) directs disclosure if the proceeding involves primarily a claim for damages, or involves potential monetary sanctions, capital expenditures, deferred charges or charges to income, and the amount involved, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeds 10 percent of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated.  Instruction 5(C) calls for disclosure when a governmental authority is a party and the proceeding involves monetary sanctions, unless the registrant reasonably believes that the proceeding will result in monetary sanctions of less than $100,000.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission revise Instruction 5(C) to replace the $100,000 standard with a general materiality standard.  Alternatively, the Commission could simply raise the dollar thresholds that trigger disclosure.  The Task Force understands that in some circumstances this \"one size fits all\" approach may result in the disclosure of non-material information about environmental proceedings.\nTo address this concern, the Task Force recommends that the Commission replace the $100,000 standard, as well as the current assets standard in Instruction 5(B), with a more flexible general materiality standard.  Should the Commission implement the general materiality recommendation, consideration should be given to providing guidance in an instruction with respect to determining materiality by suggesting, for example, consideration of whether a governmental authority is a party, the nature of possible monetary sanctions, effects and potential effects on equity, future capital expenditures, cash flows, deferred charges and charges to income.\nB.   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n=======================START OF PAGE 89==\nConsider clarifying and streamlining the rules governing when companies must disclose executive compensation information in registration and proxy statements.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission consider the necessity or appropriateness of the following suggested changes:\nAmend S-K Item 402(i), the 10-year Option Repricing Table to reduce the look-back period from ten years to five years;\nAmend S-K Item 402(f), requiring disclosure of the Pension Plan Table, which is now widely regarded as confusing and otherwise of scant utility to shareholders attempting to track post- retirement payouts to senior executives, to require a more meaningful, individualized presentation of all ERISA and non-ERISA (top-hat) defined-benefit or actuarial plan benefits expected to be paid upon retirement to each of the five most highly compensated executive officers (as defined for Regulation S-K Item 402 purposes); and\nProvide interpretive guidance on compliance with Item 10 of Schedule 14A.  Issuers reportedly have experienced some difficulty in determining what proxy disclosure is required with respect to plans that do not fit readily within the criteria of Item 10.\nThe Task Force notes that the Commission has an outstanding proposal on the executive and director compensation disclosure requirements set forth in Item 402.  The proposal would allow registrants to shift to the Form 10-K selected items of executive pay disclosure now required in proxy or information statements delivered to shareholders.  Also proposed are amendments designed to elicit more streamlined, tabularized information on director compensation in any document requiring Item 402 disclosure.  See Release No. 33-7184 (June 27, 1995).\nC.   OTHER REGULATION S-K MODIFICATIONS\nThe Task Force is making several recommendations with respect to Regulation S-K that are designed to streamline disclosure, eliminate duplication, improve the disclosure elicited by the items and update thresholds.  To the extent\n=======================START OF PAGE 90==\nappropriate, the Task Force recommends making conforming changes to Regulation S-B.\n1.  Streamline Item 101's disclosure requirements relating to the description of the registrant's business by eliminating duplication of quantitative information provided in the financial statements.\nItem 101 generally requires a five-year description of the development of the registrant's business; disclosure of the amount of revenue, operating profit or loss and assets attributable to each of the industry segments for the preceding three fiscal years; a narrative description of the registrant's business; and disclosure of financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales.\nThe Task Force recommends eliminating paragraph (b), relating to quantitative disclosure regarding business segments, and paragraph (d)(1), regarding quantitative disclosure of foreign operations.  This information already is provided in the financial statements.\n2.  Revise Item 102 relating to the description of property to elicit more meaningful and material disclosure.\nItem 102 requires a brief statement of the location and general character of the principal plants, mines and other materially important physical properties of the registrant and its subsidiaries.  Additionally, the registrant must identify segment(s) that use the properties described and state any limitations on ownership of the property.\nThe Task Force believes that the disclosure provided in response to Item 102 often contains a substantial amount of immaterial information, which sometimes may obscure the material information.  The Task Force, accordingly, recommends that the Commission revise Item 102 in a manner that more effectively elicits disclosure of material facts regarding a registrant's principal properties, rather than lists of properties and their immaterial characteristics.\n3.  Limit the scope of Item 507, relating to securities offered for the account of a\n=======================START OF PAGE 91==\ncompany's individual security holders, so that a company only would have to disclose information regarding certain of its selling affiliates and significant beneficial owners rather than all of its selling security holders.\nUnder Item 507, if any of the securities to be registered are to be offered for the account of security holders, the registrant must name each security holder, and related information.  The Task Force recommends that Item 507 be modified to require that only affiliates (as defined by Rule 144) within the last two years and beneficial holders of a certain percentage (e.g., five percent) of the registrant's securities be identified individually.  The Task Force notes that there is a recent Commission proposal to reduce the Rule 144 holding period for resales by affiliates from two years to one year.  See Release No. 33-7187 (June 27, 1995).  If that proposal is adopted, the Task Force recommends that the Commission consider conforming the period of time for disclosure of affiliates under Item 507 from two years to one year.\n4.  Move undertakings in Item 512 into a rule in Regulation C, and clarify when offers and sales may be made when a registrant has an obligation to file a Section 10(a)(3) updating prospectus.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission make the following revisions to the undertakings required by Item 512 of Regulation S-K:\nItem 512 should be eliminated and the undertakings should be made into rules.  Codifying the Item 512 undertakings will, among other things, reduce the amount of information that registrants are required to provide in Part II of the registration statement; and\nThe Commission should clarify when offers and sales may be made when a registrant has an obligation to file a Section 10(a)(3) updating prospectus by post-effective amendment.  For example, a registrant may file a Section 10(a)(3) updating prospectus prior to the time the current prospectus goes stale and continue to make offers and sales pursuant to that current prospectus.  Once the current prospectus goes stale, the registrant then may use the Section 10(a)(3) updating prospectus to make offers.  However, sales cannot be made until the post-effective\n=======================START OF PAGE 92==\namendment containing the Section 10(a)(3) updating prospectus is effective.\n5.  Eliminate Item 702's requirement to state the general effect of any arrangement regarding indemnification of a registrant's directors, officers, or control persons, which typically results in \"boilerplate\" disclosure of minimal value to investors.\nThe Task Force recommends the elimination of Item 702 of Regulation S-K.  Item 702 requires the registrant to set forth in Part II of the registration statement the general effect of any statute, charter provisions, by-laws, contracts or other arrangements under which any director or officer is indemnified against liability.  The Task Force believes that the disclosure elicited by this Item has become boilerplate and of little value to investors and that any concerns should be adequately addressed if the Commission modifies Item 510 to add a new paragraph (b) that would apply to registration statements that are to become effective by Commission action, and to registration statements on Form S-8. This new paragraph would require that the registrant disclose in the prospectus that it will perform the matters that are now the subject of the Item 512(h) undertaking, such as that the registrant will submit indemnification provisions to a court for a determination of validity whenever directors and officers are indemnified against liability.  Item 512(h) should then be eliminated.\n6.  Adjust certain dollar thresholds in Regulations S-K and S-X for inflation since the time of their adoption.\nThe Task Force recommends that the following thresholds be adjusted for inflation (determined by accounting for the passage of time since the thresholds were originally set and rounding to an appropriate whole number):\n�    The $60,000 threshold in paragraph (a) of Item 404 of Regulation S-K (relating to disclosure of a registrant's transactions with management and others)  should be increased to $100,000.  The $60,000 threshold was established in 1983.  That number, converted to current dollars based on the CPI-U Index, would be $92,590 today;\nThe $50,000 threshold set forth in the instructions to Item 509 of Regulation\n=======================START OF PAGE 93==\nS-K (relating to disclosure of payments to experts and counsel) should be increased to $100,000.  The $50,000 threshold was established in 1982.  That number, converted to current dollars based on the CPI-U Index, would be $79,637 today;\nThe $100,000 threshold set forth in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X (relating to the definition of an inactive registrant) should be increased to $200,000.  The $100,000 threshold was established in 1980.  That number, converted to current dollars based on the CPI-U Index, would be $186,529 today; and\nThe threshold set forth in Rule 144(h) for filing of a Form 144 should be revised from the current level of sales over 500 shares or an aggregate sales price in excess of $10,000 over a three- month period.  The $10,000 threshold was established in 1972.  That number, converted to current dollars based on the CPI-U Index, would be $36,000 today.  For small business issuers, the threshold for filing a Form 144 should be raised to 500 shares or $40,000.  For issuers who are not small business issuers, the threshold should be increased further to 1,000 shares or $100,000.\nD.   EXHIBITS\n1.  Create a new exhibit form, which would enable a company to file most of its exhibits on one form, thereby making such exhibits easier to locate and update.\nThe Task Force recommends consolidating all exhibit filings into a single \"supplemental information\" Form EX, filed as a separate Section 13(a) or 15(d) report.  Under current rules, locating a specific exhibit can be extremely difficult for registrants and investors alike, as every filing requires its own set of exhibits and an exhibit may not be physically attached to a particular filing that calls for it, since exhibits are often incorporated by reference from previous filings.  Adding to the confusion, different filings often bear different file numbers, so a search for exhibits often must follow a few different trails.\nThe recommendation to consolidate all exhibits would greatly simplify matters.  A person looking for an exhibit\n=======================START OF PAGE 94==\ntypically would have to look in one place.  There would, however, be a few exceptions.  For instance, exhibits that relate directly to a specific filing, such as consents and opinions, would continue to be filed with such filing.  Annual reports to shareholders incorporated into, and included as an exhibit to, a Form 10-K filing would continue to be filed with such filing.\nIn addition, in the context of offerings of asset- backed securities, registrants would no longer be permitted to file a form of prospectus supplement as an exhibit to the registration statement.  They would, instead, be filed within Part I of the registration statement.\nThe filing would be \"evergreen\" in that it would be continuously updated by the registrant.  Stale exhibits could be withdrawn by the registrant for liability purposes, but would continue to be publicly available.\n2.  Permit automatic effectiveness of a post- effective amendment filed solely to add an exhibit.\nFollowing effectiveness, companies may update their registration statements to include new consents or opinions.  Under current rules, registrants eligible to use Forms  S-3/F-3 may file updated exhibits post-effectively on Form 8-K.  The exhibit is then automatically incorporated by reference into its prospectus.  By contrast, registrants that are not eligible to use Form S-3/F-3 can accomplish the same thing only by way of post-effective amendments, which are subject to possible staff review.     In order to facilitate the filing of updated exhibits by non-S-3/F-3 registrants, the Task Force recommends that the Commission adopt a rule to permit any post-effective amendments filed solely to add exhibits to be effective automatically upon filing.\n3.  Eliminate specific exhibits that appear to be rarely used or contain information that is otherwise available.\nIn the course of its review of the exhibit requirements in Item 601 of Regulation S-K, the Task Force identified five exhibits that should be eliminated either because the information contained in the exhibit appears to be infrequently used or because the information is otherwise available.  Under Rule 418, the documents would nonetheless be subject to a specific staff request to provide a copy supplementally to the staff to aid its\n=======================START OF PAGE 95==\nreview of a filing or to publicly file the document as an exhibit.  The exhibits that should be eliminated are as follows:\nOpinion re discount on capital shares (Exhibit 6);\nOpinion re liquidation preference (Exhibit 7);\nStatement re computation of per share earnings (Exhibit 11);\nMaterial foreign patents (Exhibit 14); and\nInformation from reports furnished to state insurance regulatory authorities (Exhibit 28).\nE.   INDUSTRY SPECIFIC DISCLOSURE\nModernize the existing Industry Guides, consider adopting additional industry- specific disclosure rules, and relocate all such guides and rules within Regulation S-K.\nThere are currently seven Industry Guides, which provide disclosure guidance with respect to gas and electric utilities (Guide 1), oil and gas operations (Guide 2), statistical disclosure by bank holding companies (Guide 3), oil and gas drilling programs (Guide 4), partnerships and REITs (Guide 5), property casualty insurance claims (Guide 6) and significant mining operations (Guide 7).\nAlthough the Industry Guides are reflected in the table of contents to Regulation S-K, they are technically and physically separated from that Regulation.  The Task Force understands that many registrants find this separation confusing.\nThe Industry Guides should, therefore, be incorporated into Regulation S-K and placed intact at the end of that Regulation in the manner that industry-specific disclosure requirements are currently placed in Regulation S-X.  The Commission also should consider adopting rules to provide disclosure guidance for transactions in other specialized industries, such as real estate and asset-backed transactions.\nThe Task Force, additionally, recommends that all of the industry-specific disclosure requirements be modernized.  Although a more detailed review would undoubtedly highlight other appropriate changes, the Task Force has the following specific recommendations:\n=======================START OF PAGE 96==\nGuide 1 (Gas & Electric Utilities)\n-   Eliminate this Guide.  The information appears to be adequately covered by the requirements of Regulation S-K (principally Items 101 and 303).\nGuide 2 (Oil & Gas Operations)\n-   Eliminate the reference to Rule 4-10(k).  This reference is obsolete.\n-   Consider codification of all (or certain) SABs and ASRs relating to oil and gas into Guide 2 or Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X.\n-   Eliminate the proviso stating that certain limited partnerships and joint ventures with oil and gas drilling programs need not comply with Guide 2.  Drilling programs should be required to provide the disclosure required by Guide 2 to the extent available.\nGuide 3 (Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies)\n-   Update to accommodate changes in the economic, accounting and regulatory environments impacting banks and related entities.  Reflect the impact of (and conform the disclosure requirements to) recently issued accounting standards, such as SFAS 91, SFAS 114, SFAS 115 and SFAS 118.  Numerous disclosures that duplicate GAAP and certain disclosures that may no longer be necessary can be eliminated.  Clarify and incorporate SAB 69 into revised Guide 3.\nGuide 5 (Partnerships & REITs)\n-   Overall revisions to this Guide are necessary to reflect subsequent changes in the economic environment relating to real estate companies, disclosure rules, GAAP and staff policies.  Consolidate into Guide 5 changes that were adopted in Release No. 33-6900 (June 17, 1991) and certain of the requirements of Form S-11.  Revise to eliminate duplicative disclosures required by Regulation S-K and certain other non- substantive disclosures.  Other changes that should be considered include:\n=======================START OF PAGE 97==\nEliminate all prior performance tables, except for Table III (operating results of prior programs), and modify Table III to incorporate some useful portions of the other tables;\nClarify Item 19C regarding when \"broker- dealer only\" material is subject to staff review;\nCodify staff practice of requiring information in reports on Form 10-K information that is similar to that required by Items 13 and 14 of Form S- 11; and\nStaff practice has been to apply the disclosure guidelines and requirements of Guide 5 and Release No. 33-6900 to offerings that are substantially similar to those subject to those requirements.  For example, blind pool partnerships, through practice, comply with certain disclosure guidelines in Guide 5 relating to prior performance information.  In addition, these partnerships also provide the undertakings set forth in Item 20 of Guide 5 which relate to the filing requirements of prospectus supplements and post-effective amendments.  Blind pool REITs, due to their similarity to partnerships, also comply with these requirements.  The Task Force recommends that the practice of compliance with these disclosure guidelines and filing requirements be codified among the industry-specific rules.  These requirements would apply to offering documents relating to ongoing partnership offerings, or offerings of a similar nature, without limitation to the real estate industry.  This would be consistent with the Commission's interest in providing investors in partnership offerings with clear, concise information on an ongoing basis.\nGuide 6 (Property Casualty Insurance Claims)\n-   In order to accommodate the recommended elimination of Article 7 of Regulation S-X,\n=======================START OF PAGE 98==\nincorporate the provisions of note 6 to Rule 7-03(a) of Regulation S-X (which requires disclosure of investments in excess of 10 percent of equity).\nGuide 7 (Significant Mining Operations)\n-   Revise and simplify the following definitions in Guide 7.  One approach would be as follows:\n(2)  Proven (Measured) Reserves:  Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in underground workings and/or drill holes, outcrops, and trenches; grade and/or quantity are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character so well defined that size, shape, depth, and mineral content of reserves are well established.\n(4)(i)  Exploration Stage -- Includes all issuers in search for mineral deposits (reserves) which are not in either the development or production stage.  Such an issuer may indicate the size of a mineralized area and describe briefly the geologic, geotechnical, sampling and other such surface work which could warrant testing in depth.\n(4)(ii)  Development Stage -- Includes all issuers that have intersected a mineralized deposit with a sufficient number of drill holes, pits, or underground sampling to determine sufficient tonnage and average grade.  This deposit does not qualify as a commercially viable ore body (reserves) until a final economically feasible study based upon such work is concluded.\nThese revisions are intended to provide clarification to the current definitions and current staff positions.  They are not intended to make any substantive modifications to the definitions and current positions.\nCorrect the following technical errors:\n=======================START OF PAGE 99==\nIn the second paragraph of subparagraph (a)(1), replace the words \"oil, shale, tar, sands\" with \"oil-shale, tar-sands;\"\nIn subparagraph (b)(7), replace the word \"geographic\" with the word \"geologic;\" and\nIn subparagraph (c)(1)(i), insert the word \"data\" after \"sample-assay.\"\nF.   STAFF LEGAL BULLETINS\nConsider publishing \"Staff Legal Bulletins\" to announce significant legal interpretations of interest to a wide group of issuers.\nThere are several ways in which the Commission and the staff provide companies and the private bar with guidance in complying with the securities laws.  Among these are interpretive releases, informal written requests for no-action interpretive advice and oral requests for such advice.  The Task Force recommends that the Commission staff consider adopting another means of providing interpretive advice similar to the Staff Accounting Bulletins (or \"SABs\") issued by the accounting staff of the Commission.  Such \"Staff Legal Bulletins\" would describe significant interpretive positions of interest to a wide group of issuers.  The bulletins should be made widely available through traditional means as well as on the Commission's Internet World Wide Web site.\nG.   EDGAR\n1.  As part of the study regarding the EDGAR filing system, consider whether certain EDGAR forms should be eliminated at some future date.\nThe Task Force has considered suggestions that certain Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (\"EDGAR\") forms be eliminated.  However, because of the architecture of the Commission's EDGAR system, the Task Force is not recommending any changes with respect to the existing forms.\nEDGAR processes and disseminates most filings made by, or with respect to, domestic companies.  Electronic filers must identify their filings in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual\n=======================START OF PAGE 100==\nso that the EDGAR system can understand and process them consistently with the Commission's recordkeeping system.  Compliance with the formatting requirements also is necessary to allow the Commission staff and the public to easily retrieve electronic filings and locate information contained in them.\nThe architecture of the EDGAR system is currently being reevaluated.  See Release No. 34-36683 (January 5, 1996).  As part of this reevaluation, basic issues as to how EDGAR filings should be structured, presented, formatted, filed, processed and disseminated are being considered.  During the EDGAR contract recompetition, the Task Force recommends that the automated processing functions of EDGAR be reviewed to determine if and where the system could be simplified and made more user-friendly, without diminishing its utility -- for example, by establishing a program that assists the filer in selecting the appropriate form type.\n2.  Enable EDGAR filers to receive certain filing date adjustments without the need for a case-by-case determination by the staff as to whether the request should be granted.\nUnder current rules, an electronic filer must petition the staff for a filing date adjustment where the filer has in good faith attempted to file a document with the Commission in a timely manner but the filing was delayed because of technical difficulties beyond the filer's control.  The Task Force believes that it may be appropriate to provide for filing date adjustments for certain routine filings without the need for a case-by-case staff determination.  For example, a filing date could be adjusted automatically for an Exchange Act report filed no more than a specified number of days late when a company certified that it made good faith efforts to file the report on or before the due date but was prevented from doing so by technical difficulties beyond its control.  This would be consistent with the treatment of notices of late filing under Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act and temporary hardship exemptions under Regulation S-T and would benefit the filers and the staff by reducing the time currently required to prepare and process requests for adjustments.  In non-routine matters, such as tender offers, staff involvement with filing date adjustments would continue.\n3.  Pursue an electronic linkage of EDGAR with the exchanges, Nasdaq and NASAA.\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission continue to pursue the establishment of an electronic linkage to EDGAR for the exchanges, Nasdaq and the states, through NASAA.  Under\n=======================START OF PAGE 101==\ncurrent rules, paper copies of registration statements and other disclosure documents that are filed with the Commission must be simultaneously provided to each exchange upon which the registrant's securities are listed.  These paper delivery requirements apply even to companies that currently make electronic filings with the Commission.  The Task Force understands that Commission filings provide information about the registrant needed by exchanges and Nasdaq in order to enforce their regulations.  The same is true with regard to many securities filings required to be made with the states.  The establishment of an electronic linkage would both facilitate the regulatory processes of the exchanges, Nasdaq and the states, as well as eliminate requirements that registrants deliver to them extra paper copies of Commission filings.\n=======================START OF PAGE 102==\nX.        TRADING PRACTICES RULES\nA.  DISCUSSION OF THE TRADING PRACTICES RULES\nTo prevent manipulative activities during offerings of securities, the Commission has implemented a series of rules under the Exchange Act, which are referred to as the trading practices rules and include Rules 10b-6, 10b-6A, 10b-7, 10b-8, and 10b-21.  These rules are meant to protect the integrity of the offering process by precluding persons with a stake in the offering from activities that could influence artificially the market for the offered security.\nRule 10b-6 is a prophylactic rule that prohibits issuers, underwriters, and others participating in a distribution from bidding for, purchasing, or inducing others to purchase the offered securities or related securities during the distribution.\nRule 10b-6 contains exceptions from its general prohibitions that are designed to accommodate market activities consistent with the rule's anti-manipulation purpose.  Rule 10b-6A permits \"passive market making\" (i.e., transactions that follow, but do not lead, the market), by Nasdaq market makers participating in distributions of Nasdaq securities.  Rule 10b-7 prescribes the parameters for stabilizing activity, i.e., transactions made to facilitate an offering of a security by preventing or retarding a decline in the open market price of any security.  Rule 10b-8 pertains to distributions of securities being offered through rights, and restricts the prices at which rights may be purchased as well as the prices at which the securities being distributed, or securities of the same class and series, may be sold.  Rule 10b-21 prohibits persons who engage in short sales in anticipation of a public offering from covering such sales with securities obtained from an underwriter, broker, or dealer who is participating in the offering.\nThe securities markets have changed dramatically since these rules were implemented or last significantly amended.  These changes include the expanded role of institutional investors, new kinds of trading instruments and strategies, enhanced transparency of securities transactions, expanded surveillance capabilities of the self-regulatory organizations (\"SROs\"), increasing globalization of securities markets, and transformation of the capital raising process.  To address whether these changes warrant revision or even rescission of the trading practices rules, in 1994 the Commission issued a release commencing a comprehensive reexamination of the rules and the concepts underlying them.\nUpon reviewing these rules and comments received in connection with the concept release, the Task Force recommends that significant revisions be made to the structure and scope of\n=======================START OF PAGE 103==\nthe trading practices rules.  The rules are unnecessarily complicated, rigid, and onerous, making both compliance with, and administration of, their provisions difficult.  Moreover, Rule 10b-6 in particular covers classes of issuers and transactions that are broader than necessary, particularly given today's trade reporting and surveillance capabilities.  In our view, fundamental changes to these rules can be made, thereby reducing impediments to capital formation, but without undermining their important investor protection goals.\nB.   RECOMMENDATIONS\nReplace the trading practices rules, which have become unnecessarily complicated and burdensome, with a new, streamlined, more understandable regulation that would restrict a narrower range of activities, persons and issuers.\nThe Task Force recommends that the trading practices rules be completely rewritten in a manner that would both simplify these rules and narrow their application.  For example, Rule 10b-6 applies during distributions of securities of almost all issuers, regardless of their size, and during a period generally commencing before offers or sales begin -- even if the offering is not priced for another month or more.  The Task Force believes that prophylactic trading restrictions are no longer necessary for such a lengthy period, and that underwriters and broker-dealers, at least, need not be restricted so comprehensively with respect to such a broad class of securities.\nBy shortening the time frame of many of the restrictions and, in the case of underwriters and broker-dealers, focusing them upon less actively-traded issuers, the Task Force believes the Commission could ease substantially the burdens imposed by the trading practices rules while reducing their complexity.\nThe Task Force's proposed narrowing of the trading practices rules would not confer a license to manipulate in non- covered transactions.  All activities in connection with an offering of securities, whether or not within the scope of the restructured trading practices rules, would remain subject to Rule 10b-5 and other general anti-fraud and anti-manipulation statutory provisions and rules.  The Task Force believes that the SROs should play an integral role in this revised regulatory scheme: to help guard against abuse, the SROs should expand their surveillance capabilities in connection with securities offerings.\n=======================START OF PAGE 104==\nUnder the Task Force's recommendation, the Commission would adopt a new regulation to replace the existing trading practices rules.  This regulation would employ a number of provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act.\nThe provisions proposed to replace Rule 10b-6 would be contained in two rules:  one rule covering underwriters, prospective underwriters, and broker-dealers participating in a distribution (collectively \"underwriters\"); and the other rule covering issuers and selling securityholders.  Depending on the security's characteristics, the restrictions under these new rules would not commence until one business day or five business days prior to the pricing of the offered security, the principal event meriting regulatory protection.\nEspecially given the narrower application and shorter restricted period of the new rules, the current complex series of exceptions to Rule 10b-6 could be streamlined considerably.  The securities subject to the rule governing underwriters would be limited primarily by the addition of an exception covering actively-traded securities.  The Task Force also recommends adding other exceptions to this rule to cover all distributions to QIBs of Rule 144A-eligible securities (the current exception covers Rule 144A-eligible foreign securities only), de minimis transactions, routine dissemination of research reports, options exercises, and transactions in baskets of securities.  These new exceptions would respond to specific concerns raised by commenters.\nIn the rule governing issuers and selling securityholders, the Task Force recommends that the existing exception for issuers' plan transactions be broadened to give these plans greater flexibility.\nIssuers and selling securityholders, unlike underwriters, lack the legitimate independent business reasons to engage in trading during a distribution.  In addition, as principals in the distribution, they might have a greater incentive to influence the market to maximize offering proceeds.  Therefore, most of the exceptions applicable to underwriters would be unnecessary or inappropriate for inclusion in this rule.\nRule 10b-6A, adopted in 1993, is an exception to Rule 10b-6 for passive market making in certain Nasdaq securities.  Passive market making is limited to certain firm commitment, fixed price offerings when distribution participants account for at least 30 percent of Nasdaq trading volume in the security.  The Task Force recommends that the new rule proposed to replace Rule 10b-6A relax current eligibility criteria, thereby permitting Nasdaq passive market making in a greater number of offerings and securities.\n=======================START OF PAGE 105==\nThe Task Force recommends that the new rule proposed to replace Rule 10b-7 provide greater flexibility for stabilizing transactions.  Among other things, this rule should allow underwriters to follow the independent market for a security, eliminate the distinction in the current rule between exchange- traded securities and over-the-counter securities, and permit stabilizing levels to refer to prices reported in the security's principal market, wherever located.  The Task Force further recommends that information on stabilizing and other market activities be written in \"plain English,\" and be tailored to the particular offering.  This will provide more useful disclosure to investors about underwriters' potential market activities than is provided by the current boilerplate language.\nBecause stabilizing is activity specifically intended to influence a security's market price, the stabilizing rule would not be limited to the shortened time period applicable to the other restructured trading practices rules that are recommended by the Task Force, and would not include an exception for actively-traded securities.  To harmonize treatment of foreign and domestic issuers' securities, the Task Force recommends that the current rule's exception for distributions to QIBs of Rule 144A-eligible foreign securities be expanded to cover all Rule 144A-eligible securities.\nThe Task Force recommends that Rule 10b-8 be rescinded because it is not necessary to have a detailed, complex rule pertaining solely to distributions through rights.  In the proposed new rule governing the activity of underwriters, the Task Force recommends replacing the current exception for Rule 10b-8 transactions with a new exception permitting bids or purchases of rights during the rights offering.\nFinally, in light of the narrow scope of Rule 10b-21, and the adoption of other regulatory measures that address short selling activity, the Task Force questions whether it is necessary to have a special regulation to deal exclusively with this activity.  A number of commenters maintain that the current rule is too easily circumvented and does not capture adequately conduct that can depress artificially a security's price shortly before the offering price is determined.  Since the initial adoption of the rule in 1988, the NASD has implemented a short sale rule on a pilot basis, and the Commission has adopted the Nasdaq passive market making rule; both may reduce the need for Rule 10b-21.  Further, in the absence of this rule, short selling to depress an offering price would continue to be covered by the general anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act.  Therefore, the Commission should seek comment on whether Rule 10b-21 continues to be necessary or appropriate, or whether the rule should be amended to cover transactions in related securities.\n======================START OF PAGE 106====\nXI.   ACCOUNTING DISCLOSURE CHANGES\nIn formulating its recommendations concerning potential accounting disclosure changes, the Task Force received suggestions from a number of participants in the financial reporting process.  Many of the Task Force's recommendations that follow reflect the input received from these participants.  Other suggestions -- such as integration of the financial reporting requirements of Regulation S-X with the narrative disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K in one comprehensive package and another to modify the interim reporting scheme -- will be considered as part of a longer-term review.\nThese suggestions are important, however, and they will be considered as part of a longer range project to evaluate the recommendations of the various private sector organizations that have issued reports on the information needs of users of financial information.  Those reports make a number of recommendations to enhance the utility of financial repo\"income average\" when determining the significance of acquisitions and equity method investments, thereby refining the circumstances when the company must provide separate financial statements to those instances where the acquisition or investment is truly significant.\nIn addition to their own financial statements, registrants are often required to present separate audited financial statements of other persons in filings with the Commission.  The two most common situations where separate audited financial statements of another person are required in a\n======================START OF PAGE 108==\nregistrant's filings relate to (1) business acquisitions where the acquired business exceeds 10 percent in significance and (2) financial statements of equity method investees when the significance of the investee to the registrant exceeds 20 percent.  Significance is measured using the three significant subsidiary tests of Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X, one of which is a comparison of the investee's income to the registrant's income.  Under current rules, if the registrant's income for the most recent fiscal year is 10 percent or more lower than the average of the last five fiscal years, the registrant may elect to use the average income for purposes of determining significance under the significant subsidiary tests (thereby reducing the level of significance of the investee and eliminating or reducing the requirements to present its audited financial statements).\nHowever, the rule allowing registrants to income average is not applicable if the registrant reported a loss, rather than income, in the latest fiscal year.  In such circumstances, the test could operate to require unnecessary disclosure, particularly with respect to companies with relatively small losses in the latest fiscal year.\nThe Task Force proposes changing the rules to allow registrants to income average, for purposes of determining significance, whenever the registrant's income or loss for the most recent fiscal year is 10 percent or more lower than the average of the last five fiscal years.\nImplementation of this recommendation would require a revision to the definition of \"significant subsidiary\" in Rule 1- 02(w) of Regulation S-X.\nB.   Reduce the effect of the 45-day \"black out\" period during which many registrants are effectively prevented from undertaking a public offering by narrowing the scope of the accounting rules requiring updated audited financial statements in certain registration statements declared effective 45 days after the registrant's fiscal year end.\nThe Exchange Act generally requires filing of audited annual financial statements of a registrant 90 days after the end of the registrant's most recently completed fiscal year.  However, unless the registrant meets the requirements of Rule 3- 01(c) of Regulation S-X (relating to expected profits for the most recent fiscal year and a history of profitable operations), registration statements filed under the Securities Act must include audited financial statements of the registrant for the\n======================START OF PAGE 109==\nregistrant's most recent fiscal year if the registrant statement is declared effective more than 45 days after the registrant's fiscal year.  This requirement to provide updated audited financial statements 45 days after a registrant's fiscal year is difficult for many registrants to satisfy, and in some circumstances, prevents a registrant from filing a Securities Act registration statement during this 45-day \"black-out\" period.  The Task Force believes that the requirement to provide updated audited financial statements in Securities Act filings sooner than required under the Exchange Act should be eliminated for repeat issuers.  This recommendation would not alter current requirements relating to initial public offerings under the Securities Act.\nC.   Expand the circumstances in which a company may incorporate by  reference audited financial statements of significant investees so that such statements need not be reproduced in filings with the Commission.\nUnder Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, registrants are required to provide audited financial statements of significant investees accounted for under the equity method.  An investee is \"significant\" if the registrant's investment exceeds 20 percent of the registrant's total assets or the investee provides more than 20 percent of the registrant's income.  The Task Force recommends clarifying current rules to state more explicitly that registrants may incorporate such financial statements by reference in all reports and filings under the Exchange Act (and, consequently, that registrant's filing on Forms S-3/F-3 may incorporate by reference their Exchange Act reports containing such financial information).  The Task Force also recommends permitting issuers eligible to use Forms S-1/F-1 that have been reporting for 12 months to deliver the financial statements of \"significant investees\" in lieu of restating them in the prospectus, and to incorporate by reference financial statements of significant investees that are eligible to use Forms S-3/F-3.  The Commission should consider whether such relief should be extended to all classes of issuers.\nD.   Streamline the complex and often confusing rules requiring separate   audited financial statements of affiliates whose stock collateralizes a registrant's securities, and of persons who guarantee a registrant's securities.\nRule 3-10 of Regulation S-X requires separate audited financial statements of each affiliate whose stock constitutes a\n=======================START OF PAGE 110==\nsignificant portion of the collateral for any public issuance of the registrant's securities.  In addition, Rule 3-10 requires a registrant to file separate audited financial statements of each guarantor of the registrant's publicly issued securities.  Rule 3-10, as currently written and interpreted by the staff, can lead to multiple sets of financial statements.  In many situations, such financial statements may be of limited usefulness to investors.  The Task Force believes that simplification and streamlining of this rule is necessary.  The following recommendations have been divided into two separate recommendations, the first dealing with collateralizations and the second dealing with guarantees.\nFinancial statements of affiliates whose stock collateralizes securities of a registrant.\nRule 3-10 currently provides that the collateral is significant, and thus audited financial statements of the affiliate whose stock constitutes the collateral are required, when the book value, fair value or market value of the collateral exceeds 20 percent of the principal amount of the secured class of securities.  The Task Force recommends that audited financial statements of the affiliate should only be required when the value of the securities of the affiliate which collateralize the securities of the registrant exceeds 40 percent of the principal amount of the secured class of securities.  If the value of the collateral constitutes between 20 percent and 40 percent of the principal amount of the secured class of securities, the Task Force recommends the rules be revised to require only condensed financial statements of the affiliate.  Such condensed financial information could be placed in an audited footnote to the registrant's financial statements, provided, however, the affiliate is consolidated with the registrant.  Alternatively, the Commission could require such information in a schedule pursuant to Rule 5-04.\nFinancial statements of guarantors.\nThe rules requiring separate financial statements of each guarantor of a security are currently contained in SAB 53 and Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, as interpreted through various no-action positions taken by the Division staff.  In addition, the guarantor (if a subsidiary of the issuer) oew rulessuer (if the issuer is a subsidiary of the guarantor) must file periodic reports under the Exchange Act unless it obtains Section 12(h) reporting relief.  This relief normally is granted only if the guarantor or the issuer is wholly-owned and the guarantee is full and unconditional.  The current financial statement requirements for guarantors are complex, provide for multiple outcomes depending on the corporate structure of the registrant and the level of significance of any non-guaranteeing subsidiaries and are not understood by many registrants.\n=======================START OF PAGE 111==\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission simplify the reporting alternatives under Rule 3-10 and SAB 53 and clarify the definition of wholly-owned subsidiary to be consistent with the definition of General Instruction J of Form 10-K.  The Task Force recommends that, if the guarantee is full, unconditional and joint and several, the Commission require either summarized consolidating financial information or condensed consolidating financial statements, depending upon the significance of any non- guaranteeing subsidiaries.  This would greatly simplify Rule 3-10 and SAB 53 and actually provide more useful information to investors than is currently provided in many circumstances.  If only summarized consolidating financial information is required, it should be on the condition that in the event of a default on the security or other events which increase the need for disclosure of information relating to the issuer or guarantor, the level of disclosure increases and condensed consolidating financial information or full financial statements would be required.  If the guarantees are not full, unconditional and joint and several, or the affiliate is wholly-owned, separate audited financial statements would continue to be required.\nE.   ELIMINATION OF ACCOUNTING RULES\nStreamline accounting and related disclosure requirements by eliminating duplicative rules and those rules that have outlived their usefulness.\nThe accounting and related disclosures required in Commission documents are governed by GAAP and the rules and regulations of the Commission.  GAAP applies to all companies, while the rules and regulations of the Commission apply primarily to public companies.  Therefore, when preparing Commission documents, registrants must comply with GAAP as well as Commission accounting rules, most of which are contained in Regulation S-X.  In many cases, the Commission adopted rules that were subsequently codified by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) as a part of GAAP.  In addition, when more than one independent body is making rules for disclosure for different but overlapping populations, it is inevitable that some duplication will occur.  As a result, over the years, redundancies have developed between the FASB accounting rules and Regulation S-X.\nThe recommended changes made to the accounting items listed below are intended to eliminate Commission accounting rules where information required under a rule is substantially duplicative of information required by the current accounting literature, or where the accounting rule has otherwise outlived its usefulness.\n=======================START OF PAGE 112==\nEliminate Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X. Rule 3-12 sets forth the requirements regarding the age of financial statements at the effective date of a registration statement or at the mailing of a proxy statement.  This rule largely duplicates the information contained in Rules 3- 01 and 3-02.  Therefore, the Task Force recommends the elimination of Rule 3-12 and the merging of any non-duplicative portions into Rules 3-01 and 3-02.\nEliminate subparagraph (a) of Rule 3-15 of Regulation S-X. Subparagraph (a) of Rule 3-15 relates to the format of the income statement and balance sheet of real estate investment trusts (REITs).  This rule is no longer necessary because GAAP adequately provides for the formatting of the balance sheets and income statements for REITs.\nEliminate Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X. Rule 3-16 sets forth the requirements for registrants that have emerged from a corporate reorganization.  This rule may be eliminated because the disclosures required by GAAP (including SOP 90-7, \"Reorganizations Under the Bankruptcy Code\") and Item 303 of Regulation S-K (management's discussion and analysis) are adequate and cover the information required in Rule 3-16.\nEliminate Rule 4-05 of Regulation S-X. Rule 4-05, relating to current assets and current liabilities when a company's operating cycle is longer than one year, may be eliminated because current GAAP disclosures are adequate.\nEliminate Rule 4-06 of Regulation S-X. Rule 4-06 requires that reacquired indebtedness of a registrant must be deducted from the appropriate liability caption on the registrant's balance sheet.  The Task Force believes that this rule is unnecessary because GAAP, including current accounting practices, requires that such items reacquired should be deducted from the appropriate caption on the balance sheet.\nEliminate Rule 4-07 of Regulation S-X. Rule 4-07, relating to the mandated balance sheet presentation for discounts on shares, should be\n=======================START OF PAGE 113==\neliminated because it is outdated and unnecessary.\nEliminate subparagraphs (f) and (k)(1) and modify subparagraph (m) of Rule 4-08 of Regulation S-X. Rule 4-08 relates to the general notes to the financial statements.  Subparagraph (f), relating to significant changes in bonds, mortgages and similar debt, and subparagraph (k)(1), relating to related party disclosures,  should be deleted from Rule 4-08 because disclosure under current GAAP, including SFAS 57, appears to be adequate.\nIn addition, subparagraph (m), relating to repurchase agreements, should be revised to eliminate the disclosure requirements already required by SFAS 107 and SFAS 115.\nEliminate subparagraphs (b) through (h) of Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X. Rules 4-10(b) through (h), setting forth the requirements under the successful efforts accounting method followed by oil and gas producers, are duplicative of SFAS 19.  Specific rules for both the successful efforts and full cost accounting methods were maintained in Regulation S-X as a result of the Commission's action to supersede the FASB's determination to designate successful efforts as the method of accounting to be applied uniformly by all oil and gas producers.\nEliminate or modify Article 7 of Regulation S-X.  Article 7, relating to requirements for insurance companies, could be eliminated because the AICPA Industry Guides adequately cover disclosures by insurance companies.  However, if Article 7 is deleted, the provisions of Notes 6 to 7-03(a), relating to disclosure of investments in excess of 10 percent of shareholders' equity, should be incorporated into Industry Guide 6.\nAlternatively, Rule 7-02(b) could be eliminated because its requirements are covered by SFAS 120 and SOP 95-1.\nAny change to Article 7 would require corresponding changes to the EDGAR Financial Data Schedules, which are based in part on information elicited by disclosure requirements in Article 7.\n=======================START OF PAGE 114==\nModify Rule 10-01(a) of Regulation S-X. Rule 10-01(a) sets forth requirements for condensed financial statements to be filed for interim periods.  In 1992, interim reporting requirements were modified for small businesses.  In recommending this action, the staff highlighted its potential to be substituted for the current Rule 10-01(a).  Rule 10-01(a) may now be rewritten to be consistent with the modifications adopted for small business issuers under Regulation S-B.  This revision would reduce the degree of detail required and would make the small business modifications applicable to all registrants filing interim reports.\nEliminate Staff Accounting Bulletin 43. This bulletin provides guidance concerning the early adoption of new rules for separate financial statements required by Regulation S-X.  Guidance is no longer necessary due to lapse of time.\nEliminate or Modify Staff Accounting Bulletin 50. The Task Force recommends below that General Instruction G to Form S-4, relating to the filing and effectiveness of registration statements involving the formation of bank holding companies and requests for confidential treatment, be eliminated.  If this instruction is eliminated, the Commission should consider eliminating or modifying SAB 50, which relates to financial statement requirements in filings involving the formation of a bank holding company.\nModify Staff Accounting Bulletin 80. This bulletin provides guidance relating to the application of Rule 3-05 in initial public offerings.  The Task Force recommends that this bulletin be revised to codify previous staff relief granted.\nEliminate Staff Accounting Bulletin 86. This bulletin provides guidance on accounting for the tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards that existed as of the date of a quasi-reorganization.  The guidance is based on SFAS 96, which subsequently has been amended by SFAS 109.  Eliminating SAB 86 will have the effect of deleting questions 4 and 5 from SAB Topic 5.S.  SAB 86 may be eliminated because SFAS 109 contains adequate guidance with respect to the accounting covered by those questions.\n=======================START OF PAGE 115=\nEliminate Staff Accounting Bulletin 91. This bulletin provides guidance on accounting for income tax benefits of bad debts of thrifts.  This guidance is unnecessary because of the issuance of SFAS 109.\nEliminate Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12.A.4 This bulletin, which provides guidance in filings by Canadian registrants, is no longer necessary.\nEliminate Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5.C This Bulletin provides guidance on accounting for tax benefits of loss carryforwards and is no longer necessary because of the issuance of SFAS 109.\nThe Commission should consider eliminating or modifying Rule 3A-02 of Regulation S-X, Staff Accounting Bulletin 51, and Staff Accounting Bulletin 84 if the FASB issues new standards on consolidation.\nThe FASB has issued an exposure draft of a proposed accounting standard to specify when entities should be included in consolidated financial statements.  The comment period expired on January 15, 1996.  If the FASB issues new standards on consolidation, Rule 3A-02 of Regulation S-X, SAB 51, and SAB 84 should be reviewed to determine whether they are duplicative of FASB standards and should be deleted or modified.\nRescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin 57 This bulletin provided guidance as to the accounting for stock warrants when issuance is contingent on achievement of certain future events.  SAB 57 contained a commitment to revisit that guidance upon completion of a FASB project on accounting for stock compensation and was identified by the Task Force as representing outdated guidance to be included with the Task Force recommendations.  FASB Statement 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation includes specific provisions for transactions with non- employees that were effective as of December 15, 1995.  Since transactions with non-employees were the transactions covered by SAB 57, the SAB was rescinded as of December 15, 1995.\n=============================START OF PAGE 116==\nXII.  TECHNICAL CHANGES\nThis section focuses principally on recommendations that are designed to modernize current disclosure requirements.  In addition, several recommendations in this section relate to technical adjustments that the Task Force believes have become appropriate in light of technological advances in communications, or to accommodate other Task Force recommendations.\nMake technical changes to numerous other rules and forms, which in the aggregate should render the Commission's disclosure requirements easier to understand and follow.\nThe Task Force recommends making the following changes in order to modernize and make technical modifications to certain rules and forms:\nSecurities Act Rule 153 (Definition of \"preceded by a prospectus\" as used in Section 5(b)(2), in relation to certain transactions)\nIf practicable due to availability of a site on the Internet, extend Rule 153 to include delivery for Nasdaq listed companies (unlike an exchange, for which Rule 153 is available, there is no physical place to deliver prospectuses for Nasdaq trades).\nSecurities Act Rule 252 (Regulation A -- Offering statement)\nConsider allowing the addition or withdrawal of a delaying notation by facsimile under Rule 252(h)(2).\nSecurities Act Rule 402 (Regulation C -- Number of copies -- binding -- signatures)\nModify and clarify that typed, faxed or duplicated signatures are acceptable so long as manual signatures are retained by the company for an appropriate time period.

By their terms, Rules 702(T) and 703(T) (and thus Form 701) were effective only until 1993.\nSecurities Act Rule 902(a)(1) (Regulation S -- Rules governing offers and sales made outside the U.S. without Securities Act registration)\nUpdate the definition of \"a designated offshore securities market\" to include markets that have been recognized as such since the adoption of the rule.\nExchange Act Rule 3a12-3(b) (Exemptions from Sections 14(a), (b), (c), (f), and Section 16 for securities of certain foreign issuers)\nMake revisions to clarify that foreign issuers may ascertain their status as foreign private issuers at the end of each fiscal quarter and upon the occurrence of specified events.\nFor purposes of the Section 16 look-back provisions, clarify that a foreign private issuer may disregard the period prior to which it lost its status as a foreign private issuer.\n============================START OF PAGE 119==\nExchange Act Rule 12b-11 (Regulation 12B -- Registration and reporting -- Number of copies -- signatures -- binding)\nModify and clarify that typed, faxed or duplicated signatures are acceptable so long as manual signatures are retained by the company.

The exemption for small life insurance companies expired by its terms on December 20, 1983, and the exemption for mutual life companies was meant to track the small life insurance companies exemption.\nExchange Act Rule 14d-1 (Scope of and definitions applicable to Regulations 14D and 14E)\nModify and clarify that typed, faxed or duplicated signatures are acceptable so long as manual signatures are retained by the company.

Rule 12h-3 would be eliminated as a separate rule.\nExchange Act Rule 16a-3 (Reporting transactions and holdings)\nModify and clarify that typed, faxed or duplicated signatures are acceptable so long as manual signatures are retained by the company.

The requirement under Item 502(g) to include a reasonably detailed table of contents with page numbers, including the location of any risk factors section, is sufficient guidance.  If the cross-reference sheet is eliminated, references to it should be deleted from Securities Act Rule 472.\nEliminate the requirement under Item 501(c)(8) to set forth the \"Subject to Completion\" legend in red ink.  Such a revision would conform Regulation S-K to Regulation S-B.\nItem 509 of Regulation S-K  (Interests of named experts and counsel)\nAdd an instruction to Item 509 to require that indemnification provisions relating to named experts and counsel be disclosed.\nForm 1-A (Regulation A offering statement)\nRevise and update the narrative disclosure model for offering circulars and offering statements under Regulation A.\nForm S-4 (Registration statements to be used under the Securities Act by domestic companies to register securities in a merger or exchange offer)\nConsider eliminating General Instruction G to Form S-4, which relates to the filing and effectiveness of registration statements involving the formation of bank holding companies and requests for confidential treatment.  This instruction is no longer necessary because Securities Act Section 3(a)(12) provides an\n============================START OF PAGE 121==\nexemption for bank holding company reorganizations.\nIf General Instruction G to Form S-4 is eliminated, references to the instruction should be deleted from Rules 406(a), 464, 473(d), 475a, and 477(b) in Regulation C.\nForm F-4 (Registration statements to be used under the Securities Act by foreign private issuers to register securities in a merger or exchange offer)\nDelete the references in Rules 406(a), 464, 473(d), and 475a of Regulation C to registration statements filed on Form F-4 in compliance with General Instruction F.  This reference appears to be in error.\nForm 8-K (Current report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act)\nClarify in Item 2 of Form 8-K that, upon the acquisition of operating real estate, the registrant is considered to have purchased operating properties (as opposed to assets in the ordinary course of business) and Item 7 of Form 8-K and Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X applies.  This would codify current staff interpretations.\nForm 10-K (Annual report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act)\nEliminate Instruction I which relates to \"Registrants Filing on  Form S-18,\" since Form S-18 no longer exists.\nAdd an instruction explaining the significance of the market capitalization determination and the manner in which it should be determined.  The market capitalization project has shown that a very large number of companies complete this portion incorrectly.  Require a standardized numerical presentation.\nRequire a table of contents in lieu of cross references to the items of the form.\n============================START OF PAGE 122==\nGeneral Instruction J to Form 10-K provides for abbreviated disclosure by certain subsidiaries, subject to certain conditions.  The Task Force recommends that these conditions be updated as follows:\n-- Current rules require the subsidiary to provide a narrative analysis by management.  The Task Force recommends updating the provisions to more closely track the current disclosure requirements in Item 303 of Regulation S-K relating to Management's Discussion and Analysis.\n-- Current rules require that the subsidiary has not had, during the previous 36 months, a material default in any payment of principal, interest, a sinking or purchase fund installment or any other material default, which was not cured within 30 days, or a material default in the payment of rentals under material long-term leases. The Task Force recommends revisions to reduce the applicable time-period to 12 months. This change would conform this requirement in the Form 10-K to the more up-to-date requirements of Forms S-3/F-3.\nForm 15 (Certification and notice of termination of registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act or suspension of duty to file reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act)\nConsider parentheticals under each of the boxes on the form so that anyone reading the form will immediately understand why the registrant will no longer be a reporting company.\nIf the recommendation to merge Exchange Act Rules 12h-3 and 15d-6 is implemented, make appropriate simplifying revisions.\nForm 18 (Application for registration of securities of foreign governments and political subdivisions thereof)\nUpdate outdated references in this form, such as the reference to the \"Statistical Handbook of the League of Nations.\"\nOther Revisions\n===========================START OF PAGE 123==\nAs a result of the small business initiatives, all references to Forms 10-Q,  10-K and 10 were revised to, where appropriate, also reference the small business equivalents of those forms, such as Form 10-KSB.  However, not all changes were made with the correct conjunction (e.g., \"Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB\" as opposed to \"Form 10-K or Form 10-KSB\").  The Task Force recommends that such references be reviewed and corrected.\nChange the references in Forms F-7, F-8, F-9, F- 10 and F-80 to Rule 24 of the Commission's Rules of Practice to refer instead to Item 10 of Regulation S-K.  Rule 24 has been eliminated and its requirements are now set forth in Item 10.\n============================START OF PAGE 124==\nXIII.     OTHER CURRENT COMMISSION INITIATIVES\nThe Commission should consider this Report in conjunction with the many other initiatives currently being undertaken by the Commission to streamline and modernize regulations relating to corporation finance.  A brief summary of such initiatives is set forth below.\nStreamlining Disclosure Requirements Relating to Significant Business Acquisitions; Quarterly Reporting of Unregistered Equity Sales\nThe Commission proposed new rules designed to streamline the disclosure requirements relating to significant business acquisitions.  The proposed rules would eliminate the requirement to provide audited financial statements for certain pending business acquisitions and would generally allow registrants to provide information about significant acquisitions in Securities Act registration statements on the same time schedule as for Exchange Act reporting.  The proposed rules also would provide an automatic waiver of the earliest year of required audited financial statements otherwise required in certain cases when they are not readily available.  In addition, the Commission proposed rule revisions that would require registrants to report on a quarterly basis recent unregistered sales of equity securities.  See Release No. 33-7189 (June 27, 1995).\nRelief from Section 12(g) Registration for Small Issuers\nThe Commission proposed to raise the asset threshold that subjects companies to registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act from five million dollars to ten million dollars.  The proposals also would raise the asset threshold for termination of Section 12(g) registration and suspension of Section 15(d) reporting from five million dollars to ten million dollars.  See Release No. 33-7186 (June 27, 1995).\nSolicitations of Interest Prior to Initial Public Offerings\nThe Commission proposed a rule that would allow issuers contemplating initial public offerings to\n============================START OF PAGE 125==\nsolicit indications of investor interest in their companies prior to the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act.  In addition, if an issuer \"tests the waters\" under this proposed new rule and decides not to proceed with a registered offering, the issuer may still use Regulation A.  See Release No. 33-7188 (June 27, 1995).\nIn addition, the Commission proposed to amend the \"test the waters\" provisions under Regulation A to permit issuers that \"test the waters\" under Regulation A, and then decide to have a registered offering instead, to do so without waiting 30 days.  See Release No. 33-7188 (June 27, 1995).\nRule 144 -- Holding Period; New Trading Strategies\nThe Commission proposed to reduce the holding period required for resales by any person under Rule 144 from two years to one year, and to reduce the holding period for resales by non- affiliates without restriction from three years to two years.  See Release No. 33-7187 (June 27, 1995).\nIn addition, the Commission solicited comment on whether Rule 144 should be revised to address new trading strategies such as equity swaps.  See Release No. 33-7187 (June 27, 1995).\nExemption for Certain California Limited Issues\nThe Commission proposed a new exemption from registration for limited offerings up to five million dollars that meet the qualifications of a new California exemption for offerings made to specified classes of qualified purchasers that are similar to accredited investors under Regulation D.  See Release No. 33-7185 (June 27, 1995).\nIn addition, the Commission solicited comment on whether it should revise or eliminate the prohibition against general solicitation in offerings pursuant to Rules 505 and 506 under\n============================START OF PAGE 126==\nRegulation D.  See Release No. 33-7185 (June 27, 1995).\nProblematic Practices Under Regulation S\nThe Commission published its views concerning problematic practices under Regulation S and requested comment on whether that Regulation should be amended to limit its vulnerability to abuse. See Release No. 33-7190 (June 27, 1995).\nStreamlining and Consolidation of Executive and Director Compensation\nThe Commission proposed amendments to Item 402 of Regulations S-B and S-K and to Forms 10-K and 10-KSB and Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act.  The annual proxy and information statement would be streamlined by allowing some of the more detailed compensation disclosure required by Item 402 of Regulations S-B and S-K to be provided in the annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission rather than included in the proxy or information statement furnished to shareholders. The proposals also would affect director compensation disclosure, which would remain in the proxy statement, by consolidating certain elements of that disclosure into an easier-to-read tabular format that provides information for each director.  See Release No. 33-7184 (June 27, 1995).\nAbbreviated Financial Statements\nThe Commission proposed amendments to allow the use of abbreviated financial statements in annual reports delivered to shareholders pursuant to the proxy rules.  Rule changes also were proposed to allow the use of abbreviated financial statements in other disclosure documents, including prospectuses, required to be delivered to investors.  See Release No. 33-7183 (June 27, 1995).  Chairman Levitt has announced that further thought is being given to this proposal in light of the public comments, and consideration is being given to whether there are alternatives that may better serve both investors and companies.\nSection 16 - Ownership Reports and Trading by Officers, Directors and Principal Security Holders\n===========================START OF PAGE 127==\nIn 1994, the Commission issued two releases proposing amendments to certain rules regarding the filing of ownership reports by officers, directors and principal security holders and solicited comment on the Section 16 treatment of cash-only instruments.  See Release No. 34-34514 (August 10, 1994) (the \"Proposing Release\"); Release No. 34-34681 (September 16, 1994) (the \"Cash-Only Release\").  On October 11, 1995, the Commission proposed an alternative scheme to amend Rule 16b-3 and solicited comment on various other issues relating to Section 16.  See Release No. 34-36356 (October 11, 1995) (the \"Alternative Proposal Release\").  The Alternative Proposal Release proposed a major simplification of Rule 16b-3 to exempt from Section 16(b) most transactions between an officer or director and the issuer.  Comment also was solicited on simplifying the reporting of transactions under Section 16(a).  The release further proposed greater flexibility for DRIP plans.  In addition, the Commission solicited comment as to the continued efficacy of Section 16(b) and whether legislation should be proposed to rescind it.\nDerivatives Disclosure\nIn response to an increasing involvement in derivatives activity by public companies leading to potential exposure to significant risks, the Commission issued interpretive guidance and proposed rule amendments in a release in late 1995.  See Release No. 34-36643 (December 28, 1995).  The release was intended to (1) enhance disclosures about registrants' accounting policies associated with derivatives and other instruments and (2) increase quantitative and qualitative disclosures by registrants about the market risks inherent in these instruments.\nUse of Electronic Media\nThe Commission is working to facilitate the use of electronic media to enhance communication and save costs.  The Commission implemented one of its initiatives in this area in a recent interpretive release that discusses the ability to use electronic delivery of prospectuses and reports to shareholders who have the means to communicate electronically.  The interpretive guidance is intended to assist market participants in using electronic media to provide\n============================START OF PAGE 128==\ninformation under the federal securities laws and to encourage continued research and development and use of such media.  See Release No. 33-7233 (October 6, 1995).  A release also was issued proposing technical amendments to rules premised on paper delivery to make it clear how those rules should be implemented when electronic media are being used.  See Release No. 33-7234 (October 6, 1995).\nIn addition, the Commission has embarked on an effort to make documents and other information available through the Internet.  As part of this endeavor, the Commission established a \"home page\" on the World Wide Web, which offers access to the Commission's EDGAR database of corporate information, SEC News Digests, rule proposals, litigation releases, speeches, testimony, press releases, and other information relating to the Commission, including an electronic copy of this Report.  The Commission's World Wide Web address is http://www.sec.gov.\nhttp://www.sec.gov/news/studies/smpl.htm",
                "Issue 5 - Conflict in the Middle East by The Horace Mann Review - issuu\nA Region Wrought With Conflict\nW\nhat is it about the Middle East that makes it such a perennial region of interest to the rest of the world? This month, Review writers explore various answers to this question. For starters, a population that relies almost exclusively on oil to operate is inextricably tied to the politics of the few countries that produce more than half of the world’s most precious resource. What are the implications of being this economically bound to a region that also exports political instability and conflict? The Middle East’s acknowledged role as a hotbed of terrorism also solidifies its centrality in the global conversation on international security. 9/11’s terrorist attacks are one of the events that most significantly affected our nation’s foreign and domestic policy in the last decade. Violent conflict in the Middle East informs the American mentality in myriad ways, through terrorist organizations, the threat of nuclear power, or America’s involvement in two war efforts. A more positive social and political undercurrent in the region captures global attention, though. As the Arab Spring’s push for democratization un-\n2\nfolds, one year after its inception, citizens of all countries reevaluate the importance of representative government. Bloodshed continues in some nations as ironfisted heads of state fail to demonstrate true leadership. But the message of hope demonstrated by the Jasmine Revolution, though marred by violence and uncertainty, unites us in the never-ending march towards democracy and equal opportunity. With our eyes turned towards these complex issues, we are happy to share with you our opinions on their implications and possible resolutions. As always, The Review also presents exploration of various other current events, from the debate on Internet piracy law to factionalism within the GOP. The Review is always open to new writers interested in engaging with the events that are shaping our world.

Why do we have to deal with the coups and rebellions of Libya and Syria and the social injustices of Saudi Arabia? We do so mainly because of the Middle East’s enormous supply of oil, even though, according to a recent Consumer Energy Report, America actually gets more oil from Canada than from the Middle East. Canadian oil, however, requires pipelines to move it from oil well to oil refinery, and President Barack Obama has recently rejected one of the most important proposed pipelines, the Keystone Pipeline XL. In rejecting the Keystone XL, President Obama temporarily rejected a measure that would reduce our reliance on Middle Eastern oil and create jobs for the unemployed. The Keystone Pipeline XL would be a series of pipelines starting from the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, and running through a total of nine American states. Costing a (relatively cheap, for infrastructure projects) $13 billion, the Keystone XL would transport crude oil to the refining cities of the United States in an extremely secure way: the pipelines, made of steel, would be the safest way to transfer oil from Canada to the refining hub of Port Arthur, Texas. The economic benefits from the Keystone Pipeline XL are compelling. It would supply the United States with a more stable energy supply for a longer period of time than importing oil from the Middle East. It would cement our ties with our most important trading partner, Canada. And the most appealing part of this potential oil tap is the jobs it would create. 20,000 high-wage manufacturing and construction jobs would be newly available if the pipeline were to be built. This stimulation is what America needs now, considering the US currently has one of highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression. Many of the citizens who oppose the Keystone Pipeline XL have problems with the fact that it has the potential to cause the environment much harm – in particular, the aquifer that supplies potable water to the populations of Nebraska and Oklahoma. Those concerns are misplaced. Not only would the pipelines be theoretically leak-free, but computerized monitors would also supervise them 24 hours a day, and if for any reason a pipeline is damaged, a staff member would immediately shut down the pipeline and fix the broken part. Even if a spill were to occur, the pipelines would not be built in environments occupied by endangered species, over significant water crossings, or through paleontological digs. TransCanada would also be held responsible for any significant spill, though as expressed before, pipelines are the safest and securest way to transfer oil, and if\nfor any reason oil contaminated an underground aquifer, TransCanada would be legally obligated to find and pay for an alternative water supply. On January 18, 2012, President Obama rejected the Keystone Pipeline proposal, purely for partisan political purposes: he did not want to be pushed around by Republicans in Congress, who, in December, had given Obama a two-month period to make a decision on the fate of the pipeline. After the rejection, the President made a statement saying that the State Department was not given sufficient time to finish a review of the proposed project. “The rushed and arbitrary deadline insisted on by Congressional Republicans prevented a full assessment of the pipeline’s impact, especially the health and safety of the American people, as well as our environment,” Obama said to ABC News. While Obama’s statement is reasonable, his repudiation kills 20,000 jobs, a potentially important stimulant to the American economy. Two months should be plenty of time to map out a reasonable solution. Also, the company proposing the Keystone Pipeline XL, TransCanada, had already mapped out a route for the pipeline system, and Obama’s own Commission on Jobs and Competitiveness had recommended that the project go through. Had Obama listened to his own advisors, we would not be debating this issue today. Obama should have listened to the Congressional Republicans and have gone through with the creation of the Keystone Pipeline XL. Job creation is obviously the most direct way of stimulating our economy and lowering the high unemployment rate in the America, and the United States should not have to rely on the group of bellicose countries in the Middle East for our oil import requirements. The only reason we have tried to reconstruct the political and economic situations in Libya and the social problems of Iraq are because of the oil they provide us. A life without the Middle East would allow the United States to deal with our domestic priorities: the economy, healthcare, and budget deficits. This is the indirect benefit of severing our reliance on the Middle East.   To summarize, the Keystone Pipeline will stimulate the economy, create jobs, provide a safe way to transport oil, and will effectively end our hypocritical diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. This should be a no brainer. Congress should immediately draft a bill approving the Keystone XL, and Obama should let it pass. HMR\n“In rejecting the Keystone XL, President Obama temporarily rejected a measure that would reduce our reliance on Middle Eastern oil and create jobs for the unemployed.”\npendant\nThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\n5\nHow Post 9/11 Security Measures Have Curbed Our Rights\nnathaniel tillinghast-raby\nmerica’s civil rights activists have had a tough time of it this past decade. 9/11 has ushered the United States into a new age of government security measures and paranoia. In the meantime, faceless behemoths have led our Congress into protecting the interests of the few at the expense of the many. The results? The rhetoric and the reality of how the Constitution is applied in America today are drifting farther and farther apart. A good example of this contrast is\n6\nWikileaks. Perhaps the world’s first truly independent news source, it operates in locations around the world. A throwback to the muckraking journalism of the early 20th century, the group has broken stories from the leaking of toxic waste in Africa to the film “Collateral Murder,” which shows American soldiers, in a helicopter, shooting at Iraqi citizens and two Reuters journalists. Yet, after revealing these atrocities and many more, Wikileaks has been accused of breaking the law by soliciting information from U.S. government employees under the\nEspionage Act of 1917, an archaic relic of World War I which was created prior to Supreme Court decisions expanding the protections of the First Amendment. Wikileaks is in supposed violation of the section of the law that states that any unauthorized possessor of a document or documents that could be used to injure the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation cannot communicate or transmit the document to a person not authorized to receive it. The government is trying to use this case to set a dangerous legal precedent: The Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nDomestic that asking a source in the U.S. government for information is breaking the law and can be prosecuted as such, which would give the U.S. government total control over what is published about it. This would obviously completely violate the First Amendment. Regardless of what you think of Wikileaks and how they go about publishing their material, the fact remains that they did publish it, with the intent to expose corruption and outrages committed throughout the world. Shutting Wikileaks down because the government doesn’t like owning up to the problems within itself would violate the very spirit of the Constitution. Another, much more obscure violation of the Bill of Rights was signed into law by President Obama on December 31, 2011. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is the military spending bill for 2012, but it manages to infringe on one of our most basic rights: the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees us the right to fair trial. What this bill does is allow the indefinite military detention of American citizens if they are suspected of working to harm the United States. This incredibly loose qualification for indefinite detainment effectively allows the U.S. military to be the judge, jury and jailor of any American citizen, anywhere. Amazingly, the NDAA passed with overwhelming majorities in both the House and the Senate, even though our military court has successfully handled a grand total of six terrorism-related cases, while the civilian courts have dealt with over 400. That our entire legislative body, along with our president, was able to ignore this fact, as well as entirely disregard the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, is a terrible reminder of the age of fear that we now live in, even ten years after 9/11. The Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nThis bill, of course, builds off of the Patriot Act of 2001, which authorizes the indefinite detention of immigrants, allows the FBI to look through telephone, email and phone records and gives the government the power to go through financial records, among other provisions. To be fair, this bill was both made and passed right after 9/11, when terrorism was seen as a legitimate threat. But if the Patriot Act should have been passed at all, its provisions should only have been temporary measures. Instead, it has been in place for over a decade now, quietly endangering our civil liberties and providing a platform for bills like the NDAA. Finally, there is the widely derided SOPA and its cousin PIPA, which were introduced in late 2011. Made famous by the protests of sites such as Google, Firefox and Wikipedia, they were another step forward in the entertainment industry’s ongoing war with the Internet over copyright infringement, which has been raging on since the mid 1990s. The problem is the availability of pirated material online. The entertainment industry keeps trying to get harsher legislation concerning copyrighted material on the Internet, while Internet activists cry foul every time, believing that any attempt to control the Internet is a violation of their rights. For the most part, I agree with the entertainment industry: people deserve not to have their hard work stolen. But these bills managed to cross the line from proper regulation into outright censorship. The problems with SOPA & PIPA have been well discussed by the media: that by giving the power of online censorship to profit-driven companies, SOPA & PIPA would have killed the Internet as we know it, stifling online innovation,\ngrowth and most importantly the First and Fourth Amendments. Despite all these faults, the bills enjoyed broad bipartisan support before they were brought into the public eye. The reason? SOPA and PIPA’s sponsors received four times as many contributions from the entertainment industry than they did from tech. companies, proving that for all the grand speeches of America’s politicians, money seems to matter more to them than our Constitutionally-given rights. The examples given here are not the only times that our civil liberties have recently come under fire. There is a vast list of them, from our government using drones to kill an American citizen to warrantless searches – and it gets longer every day. Some of these abuses have come about because of greed, and others from America’s War on Terror. But does it really matter? The point is that these civil rights violations have, are, and will continue to happen unless we do something about it. An encouraging sign is that when the public becomes aware of something like SOPA or “Collateral Murder,” the general response is outrage. The problem is making people aware. There’s a very good reason why nobody has heard of the NDAA, and that’s because our politicians are aware of what most of us would think. The same reason applies to almost every example on our list. After all, the public can’t react to constitutional abuses that it doesn’t know about. Our government needs to be more transparent. It needs to stop listening to just big business. It needs to stop taking drastic actions because of 9/11. I, for one, do not want to grow up in an America where my civil liberties are anything but. HMR\n7\nThe State of Charity\nPHILIP PERL\nmerican charity is well known and regarded around the world. According to Dr. Carol Adelman, director of the Center for Global Prosperity at the Hudson Institute, Americans are the “most generous” people in the world, especially in private giving. This generosity is present in good times and in bad times whether it takes place at home or abroad. So what are some of the motivations that make us so generous compared to the rest of the world and how effective are they in solving social ills? There are as many explanations for American generosity as there are forms of charitable giving. One explanation is that Americans are just “good” people who participate in charitable giving for the sake of giving. Another equally popular explanation is that Americans are very compassionate people who simply enjoy satisfying the needs of the suffering. A third explanation is that Americans understand social responsibility better than the rest of the world. While there is some degree of truth in all of these explanations, for many Americans, charity is not just the right thing to do but also the most effective way of giving and achieving the “common good.” The belief has been that individual care is better than government care, which transfers money from one group to another. According to Andrea Coombs of CBS Market Watch, “philanthropy has become more than just an act of generosity or a tax deduction; it is an investment.” Many proponents of this view of philanthropy engage in civic service not because of tax incentives, their wealth or their generosity but because they see their involvement as an invest-\n8\nment opportunity to effectively allocate their resources, connect with different members of society and work together to promote improvement on shared concerns. Advocates for individual progress, for example, choose to invest a resource like money to reward those who have initiative or want to pursue their individual potential, while advocates for social change, on the other hand, choose to invest their time or skills because they want to solve social ills by changing the circumstances rather than actions of those suffering the most.\n“Americans understand social responsibility better than the rest of the world....Americans’ charity is not just the right thing to do but also the most effective way of giving and acheiving the ‘common good.’” Even though charitable giving in America reached a new height of more than $200 billion in 2000, the philanthropic challenge has been how to maintain charitable growth. The general belief among philanthropists is that giving works because it improves the welfare of its recipients. In reality, giving does not work because it never achieves a solution to the problem that precipitated giving in the first place. Just because giving is not effective, it does not mean that we should avoid it. Instead of looking for ways to increase giving, the emphasis should be on finding ways to give in more effective and sustainable ways so that circumstances that contribute to charitable giving would not recur. For charitable giving to work, giving must be sustainable. That means that charitable giving would have to meet\nthe needs of the recipients in the present without compromising the ability of future charitable giving. The problem with charitable giving has been that donors put money where their heart is, making recipients perpetually dependent on donations. Today there is increasing support for sustainable charity that emerged during the creation of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Through corporate social responsibility, businesses identify ideas, practices and policies that constitute effective and sustainable charity. To make a transition from giving to sustainable giving, philanthropists have to give in ways that are appealing to recipients. One way would be to fund a cause–driven business that will achieve a social goal, such as healthcare for the poor, cover all costs, and make profit. In social business, all profits would be reinvested in the venture for expansion and improvement and the investor would get his or her investment back but without dividend beyond the original investment amount. The challenge for this type of charitable giving would be to seek business opportunities that maximize profit as well as social objectives. Instead of philanthropists investing assets to earn returns, which they may give to charitable organizations, they can direct their capital and attention to enterprises that create both profit and social value. This type of giving would be attractive, as it would allow recipients to have a stake in the process. Social business enterprise would incorporate the interests of corporations with economic development in a way that would create sustainable giving. Such an enterprise would not only address many social problems but would also offer inThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nDomestic\nnovative and economically feasible opportunities for both donors and their recipients. Consider Dannon, a French dairy product corporation that contributed to social objectives in India. Instead of donating earned cash in various forms of charity to random recipients, Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi economist and founder of Grameen Bank, helped convince Dannon to give small loans to The Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nIndiaâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s poorest people to launch a yogurt business so they can lift themselves out of poverty. By lending the credit to Indiaâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s poorest, Dannon engaged in a social business and at the same time empowered the recipients to create opportunities for a sustainable business charity. Since social business enterprises can create an environment in which the poor can help themselves out of subsistence\nand into the independence that surplus brings, it will not take long before investors see that technology, experience and other skills in addition to money can also make a perpetual difference in recipientsâ&#x20AC;&#x2122; lives. HMR\n9\nMitt Romney’s Bainful Past I\nTheDailyBeast.com\nEDMUND BANNISTER n recent weeks, one of the most widespread and controversial stories in the news has been that of Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney and his record at the venture capital firm Bain Capital. Governor Romney is the former CEO of the Boston based investment firm. In recent weeks he has come under fire from Democrats and his fellow republican candidates, especially former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for leading the so called “liquidation firm”. His critics accuse him of firing all the workers at companies that the firm bought and then stripping the companies of all their assets and selling them. His political opponents are trying to brand Governor Romney as a man who laid off hard working Americans. The fact of the matter is they’re right, and he did. However, is what Romney did destruc-\ntive and hurtful? The answer to that is, in my opinion, no. Bain Capital purchased companies and sometimes, as Romney’s opponents have said, stripped the companies clean of their assets and fired their workers. However many free market, capitalist principles, especially the theory of creative destruction, suggest that Bain’s actions aren’t necessarily bad. Capitalism rests on the principle that only the strong survive, a concept similar to the theory of evolution. Evolutionary principles apply to economies and companies as well. If a company is productive, innovative, profitable, and supplies an in demand product, it succeeds and investment firms and banks are encouraged to invest in them, rather than destroy them. If a company is inefficient and unprofitable it either dies on its own, is destroyed by its more successful\ncompetitors, or is taken over and destroyed by firms like Bain Capital. This process is good for the country, businesses, their employees, and U.S. consumers. The more profitable companies proceed to take the destroyed companies’ market share and expand, or new companies spring up to take advantage of the opportunities created by the destruction of the old ones. Both of these eventualities result in the hiring of new workers. They also mean that more efficient companies have more business. If companies are more efficient it also means that they can afford to sell their products at a lower price, which both lowers prices for consumers and gains more customers for the company. The country as a whole makes progress, because innovative companies are able to expand and provide useful services to people that want and/or need them. From the seemingly sad event of the destruction of a company, jobs, creativity, and progress have emerged. The above economic ideas are embraced by Republicans in particular, which is why it is surprising that Romney’s fellow candidates are attacking him. His opponents are pandering to the lowest kind of mindless populism there is. They are using the largely held sentiment against Wall Street and corporate “fat cats” to turn mainstream voters against Romney. Republicans have always opposed regulation of companies and businesses. Instead of sticking to the free market principles that they have advocated for in the past the other candidates are going against what they believe because it is politically expedient. Their actions prove that in a race where Romney has been labeled as a flip-flopper, candidates like Mr. Gingrich are being wildly hypocritical. They are pandering to the emotions and particularly the fears of a people still recovering from the recession by pointing fingers and throwing accusations. It is not enough to say, “curb Wall Street greed,” or “lower taxes”. The critical economic issues that need to be discussed are infinitely more complex than that. Instead of explaining ideas in one liners and catch phrases, candidates should have an intelligent debate about the economic road that is best to pursue to lead the country into a more prosperous future.

A violin with a popped string might need to be mended, and an iPod with a cracked screen should probably be looked at. But a person--does any person require repairing? Little 8-year-old Elijah was found telling dropout Presidential candidate Representative Michelle Bachman, at her book signing in South Carolina this past December, “My mommy’s gay and doesn’t need any fixing.” Bachman’s charlatan smile quickly turned into an embarrassed expression, hearing those strong words come out of such a young boy’s mouth. And as she stood there, I could only wonder what was going The Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nthrough her head, for she was only able to whisper a quiet “bye now,” standing on the slightly elevated stage. The idea of gay rights is a widely debated topic, one with many different viewpoints and opinions internationally, let alone within different American political parties. But as a country that only represents legal gay marriage in six U.S. states, gay rights is still a new concept to Americans, one that not all of us are willing to accept so quickly. New York City, known to many as the Big Apple, the Empire state or the center of capitalism, is also a melting pot of diverse races, perspectives, views and attitudes. For most of us, we know it as a place where new and modern ideas can be developed, regardless\nof how conventional or un-conventional they are. With over eight million people in this one city, there are bound to be overlapping views, especially on the legalization of gay marriage. In late July of last year, when the bill passed on a vote of 33-29, the legalization of gay marriage marked not only a political movement but an urban and personal progression as well. To many New Yorkers, this bill affected themselves, a family member or a friend, seeing this as a warm gesture from the New York government. People were now able to believe that government supported their lifestyle, something many people in New York alone had been battling with for many years. Although New York, one of America’s most progressive and fastpaced cities, has legitimatized gay marriage, it is a fairly recent development compared to other countries that already allow same-sex marriage nation-wide. Countries like Argentina, Canada, Spain, South Africa and Sweden all legalized this act in 2001. And even as America’s economic capital has tackled this idea, I don’t think our national government is ready to take on gay rights as a whole. Halfway across the world, Hilary Clinton at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva publically argued that human rights and gay rights are “one and the same.” Her and Obama urged for efforts in combatting other nations that don’t recognize homosexuality and the abuse that often comes along with the intolerance against it. And while Obama and Clinton haven’t taken direct initiation for these vows, they have made it a priority to use American diplomacy to promote gay rights. HMR\n11\nDomestic\nhenry luo\nFour years ago, Ron Paul – then Texas’ fourteenth Congressional District’s representative – made a run for the presidency. Paul was a fundraising success but underwhelmed at the polls; he ultimately managed to place only fourth in the delegate count, and then withdrew, allowing John McCain to go on to be the Republican nominee. Since 2008, he has been reelected to his seat in Congress twice, defeating both his Republican and Democratic challengers overwhelmingly. Today, the same Ron Paul whom some thought of as a non-serious candidate four years ago is one of the Republican candidates again, and this time his campaign has reached new highs in popularity, running a consistent third place in most nationwide polls. Now a real contender in the contest between Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum, Paul has seen his ideas gain massive amounts of popular support. Ron Paul has transformed the Republican nomination race and, thanks to his experience and his policies, has the chance to become the Republican Presidential nominee. Many of Paul’s counterparts have\ndismissed Paul’s sometimes radical ideas; John Huntsman, before dropping out of the nomination race, called him a “crazy uncle” in one of the television advertisements he ran in Iowa. Yet, contrary to those doubters’ claims, Ron Paul’s policies are rational and realistic - and have stayed constant over time, unlike Mitt Romney, for example, who\ncreated the most controversy. Paul firmly believes in non-interventionism, meaning that the U.S. should not engage in foreign wars unless in self-defense, and that the President should not sign overwhelming numbers of treaties with other countries. Limiting entangling alliances, however, does not mean an end to diplomacy. Paul advocates for open trade and communication with foreign nations; all he wants to avoid is American involvement in foreign wars. As such, he supports the withdrawal of troops from foreign military bases. Additionally, Paul wants to put an end to foreign aid; he has been especially critical of America’s ‘special relationship’ with Israel and the huge volumes of money that America spends on maintaining that relationship. Israel, Paul notes, has the highest GDP per-capita in the Middle East; it does not need United States aid to keep it safe and prosperous. Meanwhile, limiting government aid will help the economy by reducing government spending and curtailing its involvement in the global economy. Many members of the GOP have criticized this policy, but his disdain\n“Ron Paul’s message of small, constitutional goverment and civil liberties has drawn a wider audience now. Paul has already had a major influence on the Republican primaries and his policies, though radical and sometimes unpopular, can solve this country’s problems.”\n12\nhas “flip-flopped” constantly on his stance on issues from abortion to taxation. Ron Paul is a self-declared libertarian and Constitutionalist, and firmly believes in constitutional government, meaning, among other things, a dramatic reduction in the size and scope of government. His policies have garnered disbelief, but Paul has actual concrete solutions for America’s problems. Paul’s foreign policy has probably\nThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nDomestic for interventionism made him a leader in donations from members of the armed services and their families. Paul has recieved over ten times the amount of donations Mitt Romney has recieved from members of the armed forces, for example. At a time when the United States has engaged itself in a draining war with Iraq and Afghanistan, Ron Paul’s policy of “no more wars” is particularly appealing to the masses. Fitting with his cautious foreign policy, Ron Paul proposes a dramatic reduction in the United States federal government’s involvement in life and major cuts to the budget. He has vowed to never raise taxes and believes that the individual income tax could and should be eliminated - through constitutional amendment, as to prevent it from ever returning if the government’s spending is also cut. In addition to cutting government spending, he, if president, says he would end five whole departments of the Cabinet: Energy, Commerce, Interior, Education, and Housing and Urban Development. If elected, Paul would cut the federal budget by a trillion dollars in his first year alone, essentially ending America’s overspending and associated budget deficit in one fell swoop. These aren’t the pie-in-the-sky budget proposals of the other candidates: Paul has clearly listed which programs he would cut, and how and when he would cut them. Ron Paul’s economic wisdom has become more and more popular in these last few years. His proposals to curb federal spending and cut unessential government programs have become a viable solution to the issues which plague the U.S. now. Instead of innefective stimulus spending, Paul proposes lean and efficient goverment. Paul would replace jobkilling regulations with a free and fair competitive market. At no time in history has America needed these ideas more than now. The last key plank of Ron Paul’s platform is his support for civil liberties. Paul was one of the few ReThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\npublicans to vote against the contorversial PATRIOT Act, and he endorses continued protection of important constitutional rights like the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms and the Fifth Amendment’s right to a fair trial, including the right of habeas corpus for those accused of terrorism. Even more radical, he’s supported the legalization of prostitution, at least on the federal level, on the grounds that the Constitution allows citizens to do “controversial things” and government should not encroach on those rights; in fact, without violating the principle of federalism, government cannot encroach upon them. For the same federalist rationale, Paul stated his belief that states should be given the decision as to whether or not to legalize gay marriage and drugs, like heroin and marijuana. The one major social issue Paul does not take a liberal position on is abortion rights; but despite that, Ron Paul does not believe in federal government’s regulation of constitutional rights and he doesn’t want federal laws or Constitutional amendments restricting the civil liberties of citizens, as the states, he feels, have the sole Constitutional power to regulate the provision (or lack thereof ) of abortion. Paul would also end federal funding of abortion agencies. Ron Paul is not the favorite to win the Republican nomination. He is a radical libertarian who will not appeal to many voters. He has extreme ideas like his proposal to abolish the Federal Reserve and a desire to return to the gold standard. His foreign policy has been received poorly by many, like those in South Carolina, which has a major military community. He may have had strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire but will likely suffer in other states. However, his message of small government and civil liberties has drawn a wider audience now. Paul has had a major influence on the Republican primaries and his radical, unpopular policies can fix this country’s problems.

The many anti-Romney advertisements financed by Gingrich were, in large part, financed by the billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, helping Gingrich to win the South Carolina primary. Newt’s hail Mary worked, sending Romney and his advisors back to re-strategize. Mitt Romney’s only option was to go into Florida playing the other candidates’ game of attacks on personal life and past records. In Florida, he\n14\ndid. During the debates on January 23rd and 26th Romney made a mockery of Gingrich, stating how Gingrich was hypocritical in his accusations toward Romney and reminding the country of Gingrich’s resignation as Speaker of the House. Romney went into these debates, not only playing Gingrich’s own game of attacking the opponent, but Lalso laying down his platform and providing evidence as to why he would have a better chance of unseating President Obama. Partial reasoning behind Romney’s loss in South Carolina was due to Gingrich’s proclaiming Romney as anti-immigrant and branding him as someone who is dishonest. Soon after, Newt Gingrich became, according to intrade.com, the betting favorite to win the Florida primary, and Romney barely a favorite to win the nomination.\nHowever, in Florida, Romney turned a corner responding to all of Gingrich’s previous allegations: in response to Gingrich’s calling Romney “anti-immigrant,” Romney replied, “I’m not anti-immigrant. My father was born in Mexico. My wife’s father was born in Wales. They came to this country. The idea that I’m anti-immigrant is repulsive. It’s simply the kind of over-the-top rhetoric that has characterized American politics for too long.” Furthermore, Romney, who was blasted at by Gingrich for having investments with mortgage agencies Fannie May and Freddie Mac in mutual funds with Goldman Sachs, countered Gingrich’s statement saying: “Mr. Speaker, I know that sounds like an enormous revelation, but have you checked your own investments? You also have investments for  mutual The Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nDomestic “Romney’s success with Bain Capital, a company he cofounded, led him to more than financial prosperity: it created jobs and wealth for many thousands of workers.” funds that also invest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.” To which Gingrich had nothing else to say other than, “all right.” In addition to defending himself, Romney asserted his feelings on some of Gingrich’s stances: Gingrich’s unusual ideas on outer space and beliefs in placing residents on the moon came with Romney’s retort of,  “I spent 25 years in business. If I had a business executive come to me and say they wanted to spend a few hundred billion dollars to put a colony on the moon, I’d say, ‘You’re fired.’ ” As of now, Florida voters have increasingly come to view Gingrich as promising anything to win votes. Romney also brought up Gingrich’s time as a consultant for Freddie Mac to peoples minds:  “Freddie Mac was paying Speaker Gingrich $1.6 million at the same time Freddie Mac was costing the people of Florida millions upon millions of dollars.” Romney went on through both Florida debates stating why, in fact, his success in business would lead the country out of the near-recession economy that Obama has done little to improve. He viewed Gingrich as just\nanother Washington insider. Upon evaluation of a candidate, one must look at his or her past to find if past accomplishments can led to a prosperous future. Romney’s success with Bain Capital, a company he cofounded, led him to more than financial prosperity; jobs and wealth were created for many thousands of citizens. Voters should not disapprove of Romney because of his financial success, an argument Gingrich has been trying to make, but rather view it as a positive. Likewise, they also should not disapprove of him because of the amount of taxes he pays. He pays what is legally required; payment of a high tax rate by any candidate is not an issue worth debating because of its merit-sound. The Federal Reserve recently reported they will keep short term interest rates close to zero until 2014, aiming to spur economic growth. This is imperative as the most recent report on GDP showed that, even with 2.8 percent fourth quarter growth, economic growth remains sluggish and is likely to take until 2014 to recover. Because of Romney’s success in business and his strong job creation background, I believe he would help quicken the eco-\nnomic growth compared to Gingrich and Obama, both of whom are lacking in this area. At different times our country needs a leader experienced in the important issues of the day: and today it is an intricate knowledge of business and industry. To solve our problem, Romney has a sophisticated and well thought out plan consisting of reduction of taxes, spending, regulation, and government programs, while he wants to increase trade, energy production, human capitol and labor flexibility. When taking an individual’s morals into account, Mitt Romney will have the better chance to beat out Obama for the presidency, for, unlike Romney, Gingrich’s personal life is looked down upon by many: having been married three times including multiple affairs. These wrongdoings would affect Gingrich, would he be the nominee, again making Romney a more popular candidate. Through the success of Mitt Romney, and the flaws in New Gingrich, Romney has clearly proven to be the superior presidential candidate.

Its booming economy with its extraordinary GDP growth and relatively low unemployment rate, and its outstanding infrastructure are all envies of the world, especially in the tough economic times in which we live. However, just south of this authoritarian power sits India, which lives, without cause, in the shadow of China. India’s approach to political and economic issues is vastly different from China’s. One may be surprised to learn that India\n16\nhad the largest GDP growth rate of any country with an economy larger than $900 billion, even outgrowing China. India’s phenomenal success with its laissezfaire capitalist-friendly policies is a sign of hope for Western capitalist ideals in a world where they often seem to fail elsewhere. The beginning of this economic growth can be traced to 1991, when Manmohan Singh, India’s current prime minister, instituted a massive overhaul of the financial system, changing India’s economic identity from socialist to capitalist. Since 1992, India’s GDP has skyrocketed, in-\ncreasing seven-fold in a twenty year time frame. Cleary, though, India’s economy is not quite yet on par with China’s. India’s GDP per capita is a mere one-third of China’s, coming out at just below $1,500, and still less than that of Nigeria, Sudan, or the Philippians. Less than 10 minutes from the heart of downtown Mumbai, India’s wealthiest and most populous city, lies Dharavi, a slum not much larger than half of Central Park and home to over one million povertystricken Indians. However, Dharavi is an economic hub and has a GDP of almost $1 billion. Drawn by the opportunity to make The Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nInternational\ne r i a n\no i li l\nM to money and advance their families in society, poor Indians from all over move to the unhygienic collection of shanties right in the middle of the India’s business capital. “Dharavi [is] a city within a city,” says the secretary of the Housing Ministry of Manharastra State. There are even millionaires who have worked their way out of poverty and now run major multimillion dollar Dharavi companies. In essence, the Dharavi slum is a social ladder and economic powerhouse for poor Indians who would otherwise have no way of improving their lot. The most phenomenal part about the slum is the fact that its GDP per capita is shockingly equivalent to two thirds of the Indian national average. If this were true for the poorest neighborhoods of the U.S., the average household income in these areas would amount to approximately $35,000, well over the\n$22,000 per household poverty line that approximately 50 million Americans live under. Furthermore, the GDP per square mile of the Dharavi slum is comparable to\nDharavi, land now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Caution is in order since, in the past, attempts to build low-income housing in Indian slums have failed, often resulting in the displacement of the slum population all together, siphoning off money to other projects like luxury complexes and leaving decaying tenements in their wake. Of course, with one quarter of its population still below the poverty line, mediocre infrastructure, a relatively corrupt and inefficient government, and a less than poor education system, India still has plenty of room for improvement. Nonetheless, with a large English speaking population (keep in mind that it was an English colony up until 65 years ago), India already has an invaluable advantage and should be easily capable of continuing its remarkably high chamorrobible.org growth levels. HMR\n“In essence, the Dharavi slum is a social ladder and economic powerhouse for poor Indians who would otherwise have no way of improving their lot.”\nThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nmany large cities around the world, and even outpaces London and Los Angeles. The slum is a perfect example of how India’s economy has bloomed despite little guidance from the government. A debate has arisen in India around whether or not the government should follow the Chinese method and develop\n17\nO\ncharles cotton\nver the past few years, the Chinese government has been cracking down on longtime political dissidents and practically anyone who says or writes anything against the communist dictatorship. Many believe that this is because of the recent uprisings across the Arab world that have been unexpectedly successful. The most infamous example was the inability of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo to attend the awards ceremony in Stockholm because of his incarcerationfor an 11-year term. His wife was not able to attend the dinner either as she was under house arrest. Despite the fact that the Chinese government is very concerned about its image as a progressive forwardthinking entity, it was unable to show the world it could overlook Liu’s “crimes.” Recently they have been arresting and incarcerating more dissidents, both religious and political. At the same time, China’s economic power continues to grow at an extremely fast rate. The Chinese economy has recently become the world’s second largest, outstripping Japan’s while continuing to strive towards surpassing the United States. Many people wonder if China can continue to grow economically and maintain its status as a superpower in the\n18\nglobal economy without granting certain human rights. It seems as if the government is far too powerful for the dissidents to have any direct effect on its policies, but the increasing number of dissidents put in jail, or placed under house arrest, may cause some in the international community to try and distance themselves from the repressive Chinese leadership. This might cause the Chinese economy to take a major hit. There are numerous examples of dissidents being released from prison after serving their sentences and telling not only of the basic human rights denied to them, but also of the way in which they were treated. Many report having been tortured, beaten by guards, and humiliated in front of others. The actions that the Chinese government takes against these dissidents are what most would categorize as inhumane. Considering the fact that China does not appear to aim for total control over its citizens the way North Korea does, it comes as a surprise to many that it censors its people and media in such a punitive way. That is to say that the Chinese people can choose what to wear, where to live, and what to eat, but when it comes to the issue of free speech, or their personal expression, they have very little freedom at all. If the Chinese government continues to censor its citizens and severely pun-\nish political and religious dissidents, one would hope that it would no longer be treated as an equal partner of free and independent states. The world community should ensure that China realizes that after getting to the economic state that it is in, along with having the largest population in the world, it must start acting like a government with this much importance and responsibility. With its rapidly increasing global importance, one hopes the Chinese government will reform itself into a modern government - one that guarantees its citizens the right to free speech and self expression, without the fear of punishment. Especially in the wake of revolution in countries like Egypt and Yemen, China must take into account the power of the Internet and social networking to inspire spontaneous uprising among its large citizenry. China should remember that these modern forms of association were not around during the protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, which were easily quashed with around 600 people killed. If China were to institute reforms, it might serve its own best interests in reducing the growing tensions between the ruling party and the dissidents as well as the relieving growing unhappiness among its citizens who labor under censorship in all aspects of society and an outstanding lack of due process. HMR The Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nInternational\n1,027.\nLife\nOne thousand twenty seven Palestinian prisoners were exchanged for one captive Israel soldier. Gilad Shalit was held captive for 5 years after Hamas soldiers raided his tank, murdered the remaining Israeli soldiers with him, and dragged him into captivity. On October 18, 2011, he was released in a prisoner swap. The prisoner swap was completed in two phases. Four hundred seventy -seven prisoners chosen by Hamas officials were released on October 18, and 550 were released more recently. The number of the prisoners exchanged has more significance than just their value as they set troubling precedents and may complicate peace negotiations. The timing of the prisoner exchange raises questions about the motivation of Hamas to free Gilad Shalit. The prisoner exchange came several weeks after the President of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, applied for United Nation’s recognition of a Palestinian state. This action by Abbas was very controversial. In an attempt by Hamas to increase its relevance and popularity, the prisoner exchange was agreed upon. Thus, it appears that the situation was motivated by political gain rather than by a desire to achieve peace negotiations with Israel. The prisoner exchange compromises further peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel. Hamas was rewarded for its violence. Israel established the exchange rate to free captured soldiers at over 1000:1. Calls all over the Arab world came for Hamas to take advantage of IsThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 4\nrael’s willingness to negotiate and capture more Israeli prisoners for use in bartering. Freeing over a thousand prisoners for only one man will eventually jeopardize Israel’s security. Hamas may continue to take advantage of Israel’s willingness to complete such a lopsided trade. The Prime Minister of Israel, Binyamin Netanyahu, was under significant pressure to release the prisoners in exchange for the freedom of Gilad Shalit. In 1995, Binyamin Netanyahu published a book, A Place of Sun. In this book, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, “the release of terrorists is a mistake the Israeli government repeats time and time again.” Nevertheless, Netanyahu went ahead and exchanged a plethora of convicted captive terrorists for one Israeli soldier. it can be argued that Netanyahu succumbed to media pressure while ignoring the country’s security. According to Yedioth Ahronoth, a local Israeli newspaper, a poll was conducted that showed 79% of Israelis favored the prisoner exchange. Although Netanyahu was acting with the support of the polls.he may have undermined Israel’s security It must be realized, however, that when Gilad Shalit was kidnapped he was in the process of completing his mandatory military service. Israel has a mandatory military requirement for anyone over the age of 18 with few exceptions. Since Gilad Shalit was fulfilling his mandatory requirement, the Israel government needed to make every effort to free him in order to demonstrate to its soldiers its complete support. By exchanging over 1000 prisoners for Gilad Shalit, the\nIsraeli government demonstrates that it will support its soldiers at all costs. However, it simultaneously portrays Israel as weak to Hamas. How can any government justify releasing over a thousand terrorists? Moral reasons cannot be used to justify a political action. It significantly undermines security as well as establishes a dangerous precedent for future prisoner exchanges. This prisoner exchange raises but does not solve many controversial topics. Should Shalit have been sacrificed for the safety of Israeli society? In this situation, Gilad Shalit’s freedom could lead to the death of many other innocent civilians since it is well known, and has been demonstrated in the past, that many of these released terrorists will go on to launch further attacks against the citizens of Israel. Hamas did not act in a way to bring on peace negotiations. They may be encouraged to capture other soldiers or civilians and use them as hostages or pawns in negotiations. As evidenced by Netanyahu’s statement and his current action, the importance of individualizing each decision is demonstrated. The exchange does, however, emphasize the importance of the individual and the importance of life to the state of Israel. The fact that 79% of Israelis were in favor of the exchange highlights the values of not only the Israeli people, but the Israeli government as well. It is necessary that a country constantly under attack stand together and regard human life with the utmost importance. HMR\n19\nFeatures\nT\nhousands of Egyptians occupied Tahrir Square on January 25, 2012, in commemoration of the first anniversary of the revolution that was the zenith of Arab Spring, inspiring demonstrators in Syria and Libya. Accompanying the celebratory mood, however, was a mix of agitation and tension. Still painfully reminded of the resurgent protest movement against military rule in November, this time around Egyptians had become splintered into opposing groups of military rule supporters and political factions, when they had once gathered in Tahrir Square as a unified mass. Two of the nation’s most powerful institutions, The Muslim Brotherhood and the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, have already raised the suspicions of Egyptians in their struggle for power. The protests against the military’s increasingly explicit attempts to decree for itself special powers in November led to four days of violence and unrest. The brutal crackdown on demonstrators that left at least 40 demonstrators dead ignited an even broader backlash against the military’s power grab, but Brotherhood leaders equivocated on whether they supported the swelling protests. The Brotherhood, which recently won a dominant role in parliamentary elections, and the military rule reached an agreement that would hand power to an elected president by June 2012. Dissenters immediately labeled Brotherhood leaders to be “opportunists who lost their principles in exchange for a piece of power.”\n20\nThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nFeatures Despite citizens’ ambivalent feelings towards the Brotherhood, the anniversary celebration did indicate one unequivocal position; most citizens called for a swift exit of the ruling generals. A banner in front of the stage in Tahrir Square on the anniversary read: “The people want to end the military trials of civilians. The people want the handover of power. The people want the restoration of the stolen money.” Pro-Brotherhood groups and anti-military factions gathered to chant phrases such as “Down with the military rule!” One question that has arisen from these tensions is whether the power struggle between the Brotherhood and the military rule will end in accommodation or in conflict. The Brotherhood, even after gaining a majority in parliament, still remains subordinate to the military junta, but Egyptians grow increasingly distrustful of the transitional government, which not only is failing to re-establish stability and order, but also uses draconian measures to silence opposition. The violence with which the military attempts to control its citizens certainly does not evoke an image of democracy somewhere down the line; the fact that people continue to protest demonstrates the ineffectiveness of this transitional government. In February 2011, the Supreme Council had declared it would old power only for six months. Now, a year after the Mubarak’s ousting, Egypt remains under martial control, and citizens are worrying about the Council’s attempts to cement its powers under a new constitution. Clearly, the military government has a vested interest in maintaining influence unrelated to, perhaps in opposition to, achieving democracy in Egypt and keeping the sta-\nThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 4\nbility. How can a government that does not institute effective reform and whose intentions are ambiguous ease the transition to a new nation? The army is working effectively to create for itself a repertoire of superiorities through which it will be able to maintain its control over the civilian population. For example, the Council, led by Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, claimed to have curbed the state of emergency law by limiting its use of extrajudicial arrests and detentions to cases of “thuggery.” The term “thuggery” could apply not only to protesters but to potentially anyone the Council chooses, establishing a legal pretext for the army to take measures against civilians who should never be tried in a military court in the first place. Thus, by increasing the scope of control in the public sphere the army aims at widening its power gradually. What the people want is not another repeat of the Mubarak regime with rampant police brutality and suppression of liberty. On January 31, 2012, thousands of protesters marched to Parliament to demand that the military rulers surrender power now, before a new constitution is drafted and without any sort of immunity. When met by a barrier of Brotherhood members, however, the protesters turned their anger on them, chanting “No Brotherhood, no officers. Down, down with military rule!” The volatility of some of the protesters demonstrates a deep uncertainty and anger that is easily directed; right now, Egypt is in no better shape than it was during Mubarak’s regime. The fact of the matter is, the revolution that took place was not one at all; a revolution ushers in an era of reform,\noverhauls, and transformation of a nation. Egypt’s reality remains the same as it was during Mubarak’s regime; the only change was the name of the oppressor. The collective uprising of the people did not result in a new consciousness and set of principles, nor did it realize a new nation derived from the will of the people. Somewhere along the way, protesters, Brotherhood, and military council members alike all lost sight of their values and morals; civilians should not need an army to keep it from murdering others during a soccer match, and the military, which is meant to protect the people, should not be joining in the brutality. The protesters are angry, and rightfully so, for the military has not fulfilled the promises it made, but resorting to violence and continuously disrupting the peace will only further hamper efforts for reform. The ideals the protesters fought for a year ago have now degenerated into mob mentality and disorder. These citizens are deluding themselves if they believe mindless violence will bring about lasting change; if they have lost sight of their goal, then they have lost their right to revolt. In the face of all this, can Egypt truly achieve liberty and democracy? If so, all aspects of the country must work in a cooperative effort. The military junta must efficiently hand over power to civilians. The protesters must stop ascribing blame and resorting to violence to make themselves heard. The Muslim Brotherhood must not stand on the sidelines as history is made. Dismantling Mubarak was only step one of the revolution. The next is to install a new government that can effectively institute reform and do what is just and right for its people. HMR\n21\nT\nLET THEM\nhe common American fears Al-Qaeda. And rightfully so. Yet at the same time the common American could not describe the detailed intricacies of the group or the names of its various leaders. The Al-Qaeda is a name that sets of a trigger. The trigger of 9/11 that has forever left a stigma on this country and brings us back to one of the darkest days in our history. But let us not forget the success of our government at combatting and foiling the ensuing, attempted plots. But let us not forget the success at killing masterminds of these cruel men such as Osama Bin Laden. But let us not forget the resiliency of the American people, how we, united, stood as one in the midst of an intimidating national defense issue. It’s our duty to never forget those lost on 9/11, but it’s also our duty to stand strong for those same people. The only way AlQaeda beats us now is if we let them dictate and control our lives by emotional fear. As the great Abraham Lincoln said in his Gettysburg Address, “that these dead shall not have died in vain”; and again we now must gain back our freedom for those who sacrificed it. The freedom of fear. Because we can. Osama BinLaden alongside his top advisor, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, founded Al-Qaeda sometime between 1988 and 1989, with the top priority of carrying\nout a global jihad against all cultures and religions that differed from the beliefs of traditional Islamic Sharia Law. This was a movement totally new to the world, so radical that almost all Muslims denounced the group despite the growing anti-American sentiment in the Middle East. Bin Laden grew to denounce American and Western countries’ prevalence in the Middle East vehemently, especially such influence in his home country of\nSaudi Arabia. The hatred and repulsion of one radical man’s disgust for the principles of Western culture sparked what is now considered the most dangerous and potent threat to our national security. But just as years go on and times change, so does Al-Qaeda. Once accustomed to the safe havens of the tribal regions in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Al-Qaeda is now a nomadic group, attempting in large part unsuccessfully to launch attacks from Yemen and other countries in the Arabian Peninsula. No longer is Al-Qaeda as much a threat as the American people believe. Al-Qaeda undoubtedly once rose but now they are steadily falling. Al-Qaeda had once been accustomed to steadfast support and sanctuary in the\nrorist organization and its allies. Supporting Al-Qaeda makes the tribal regions a target for American bombs and drones, leading to more deaths and attacks on innocent civilians. Additionally, providing sanctuary to Al-Qaeda increases the growing tension between the tribes and the Afghan and Pakistani governments, further harming the relations of the tribal regions. As a result, Al-Qaeda’s most prominent branch today appears to be the AQAP (Al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula), which has steadily attempted to launch attacks on Western soil. For example, the infamous Christmas Day Bomber, Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was trained out of Yemen by Al-Qaeda to launch a global jihad.

Yet since the 9/11 attacks, the American government has launched a relentless campaign against these inhumane fiends with the objective of capturing or killing these terrorists. Al-Qaeda and its allies have slowly deteriorated due to the lack of support from the Muslim world and the simple lack of needed capacity to carry out attacks. First off, the killings of Osama Bin Laden along with U.S. citizen Anwar Al-Awlaki were instrumental successes in the American combat against terrorism. Awlaki was an American citizen in Yemen who was killed while crossing a desert in a car by a U.S. attack confirmed by President Barack Obama. Awlaki posed\ndetermination, and evil-driven charisma who can pose a greater threat to American security. Perhaps the most important advancement in counter-terrorism was the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Though Al-Qaeda was quick to name Zawahiri the leader of the group and claim that revenge and a violent reaction would arise, the fact remains that Al-Qaeda lost its fearless and brilliantly evil leader. Al-Qaeda will continue to plan attacks against all Americans and American culture, but Bin Laden was a genius planner, a rallying and uniting force for the terrorist group, and the man with the experience and capacity to launch attacks. With Bin Laden gone, the group is in utter disarray. Bin Laden possessed a rare tandem\nIlyas Kashmiri: June 3, 2011\nN.

The Arab Spring has showed an undeniably quest for democracy amongst nations that once supported Al Qaeda, which now believe much more strongly in setting up fair, democratic governments. The democratic quest for many of these Middle Eastern countries reveal a new wave of sentiment, aimed at personal freedoms and liberties of all people. The people of the revolting countries demonstrate their weariness at tyrannical and dictatorial governments, like that of AlQaeda, instead aim to implement governments that directly represent the respective people of each independent nation. It is important to recognize that AlQaeda does not possess the capabilities and capacity to carry out the horrific attacks we have grown to fear. Nevertheless, the game changes as soon as they get hold of a nuclear bomb or something of atomic power, but that is for another day. It is also important to recognize that Al-Qaeda still and will always remain a threat, as there will always be people who hate American and Western society, culture, and ideals. Yet we must not overreact to the threat and carry on our lives with such inexplicable fear. Let the terrorists fear us, don’t fear them. HMR\nA. Hafs al-Shahri: September 15, 2011\n23\nOn the “Right” Side of Israel\nI\nlaszlo herwitz\nsrael, the world’s only country to be established under the tenets of Judaism, was founded in 1948 on the principles of liberty and equality. Because of this, some may say that it is ironic that the Israeli government treats the Palestinians with such hostility. Another problem Israel has is that all the countries around it either have fragile peace treaties or want to destroy it all together. These concerns about safety have led people to flock to the more conservative wing of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. This influence has forced Israel to take a tougher stance on the building of settlements, caused peace-talks between the Israelis and Palestinians to break down, and has also been a catalyst for Israel’s covert sabotage policy against Iran. Recently, the Israeli government has taken a more extreme stance on the building of settlements in the West Bank through refusal to renew its freeze on settlements for a longer amount of time, after having discontinued the building of settlements for a one year period. This is due to the fact that many people have not been satisfied with the way Israel is functioning and, thus, have voted for the most conservative wing of the Knesset. This very conservative wing of the Israeli Parliament is sympathetic to the UltraOrthodox, whom many Israelis criticize\n24\nAn Analysis of the Move Towards Conservatism in the Jewish State for not holding jobs, living off of state welfare programs, and not having to join the army at age 18 like the rest of Israeli citizens. These pro-Orthodox sentiments cause the members of the conservative parties in the Knesset to aggressively advocate for no concessions or freezes of settlement building in the West Bank because these settlements are mainly built for the ultra-Orthodox. This factor guarantees the conservative parties the vote of the ultra-Hasidic Jews, which, although not big, is quite influential. Another ramification of the push for a more conservative government in Israel is the break down of the peace-talks between the Israelis and Palestinians. The political left in Israel is the faction that advocates for a Palestinian state created out of the West bank and other Israeli concessions, whereas the political right, refuses to allow any concessions on the part of Israel in the creation of a Palestinian state. The stance of the right wing members of the Knesset reflects the view of a significant proportion of Israelis. Even though many Israelis would like to see a State of Palestine, there are just as many who don’t, and these are the people who feel that the current Israeli administration has been too willing to make concessions. Such conservatives have also helped fuel the election of more right-wing politicians to the Knesset. A number of right wing politicians who\nplay a role in the peace talks have maintained the position that no concessions should be made if a state is to be created. The hardline stance of these politicians has caused anger and resentment on the Palestinian side of the peace talks, contributing to the subsequent break down. Unfortunately, a termination in peacetalks may turn out badly for Israel in the short term. Many Palestinians would feel disenfranchised at Israel’s refusal to negotiate and will turn to radical political groups, such as Hamas in the Gaza Strip, in their attempts to create a Palestinian state. The political right in Israel has been an outspoken advocate for strong sanctions and even military action against the Iranian nuclear Program. Their growing influence has contributed to the slew of attacks this past year on the Iranian nuclear program. Earlier in 2011, a virus known as ‘Stuxnet’ ravaged several Iranian nuclear centrifuges. The origin of this virus is unknown, however, many speculate that it was created in Israel due to the fact that Israeli officials seemed rather happy when questioned about it. In addition, a piece of data in the virus can be interpreted as a reference to a part of the Old Testament. More recently there have been two other attacks on Iran. The first attack consisted of blowing up a Revolutionary Guards base in Tehran, which killed a senior Revolutionary Guards ofThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nFeatures\nThe Knesset\nficial who had played a large role in the Iranian nuclear program. The second attack occurred a few weeks ago when a magnetic bomb, attached to a car, killed a senior Iranian nuclear scientist. If Israel actually executed such attacks, which is highly likely, then it highlights Israel’s growing fear of Iran’s continued nuclear program. As such, many Israelis feel that the government is not treating this situation gravely enough and are thus flocking to the conservative politicians that advocate for quick and decisive military action against Iran. It is evident that the Israeli people want politicians who will act more decisively in solving Israel’s problems, making Israel’s safety their top priority. It is equally evident then that these people don’t necessarily want to always take military action; they are simply worried and\nlatch on to the most reassuring and forceful solution, whether or not they think it is in the best interests of the state in the long term. This swing towards conservatism is still in its early stages, so its long-term effects are still unknown. Depending on the will of the people of Israel, we can expect to see changes in the policy of the Israeli government in the years to come. There are two obvious outcomes to this situation. The first outcome is that the swing continues and Israel becomes more militarily hostile. This would be helpful in the short term because it would muscle\n“The stance of the right wing members of the Knesset reflects the view of a significant proportion of Israelis.”\nThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nIsrael’s enemies into submission. However, in the long term in would alienate Israel’s allies and cause Israel to lose support within the UN, a body that is not currently sympathetic to Israel and Israeli interests. The other outcome is that the situation with Iran cools down. If this happens then the Israeli people would move away from the hard-right because they would feel that such extreme measures were no longer needed. HMR\n25\nThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nS\nW\nBRETT SILVERSTEIN\nith the world currently focused on the upheaval in Syria and the recent elections and riots in Egypt, let us not forget the precarious situation in Iran. Over the past month Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Straits of Hormuz, through which 17 million barrels of oil are transited every day--roughly equivalent to 20% of the world’s daily oil production. However, it is important to keep in mind the different goals and agendas of the nations that are involved in the standoff. Whether or not Iran will stand by its word is questionable. While they do have a navy capable of closing the straits the United States and European Union have sent ships of their own into the Persian Gulf to make sure the straits stay open. On January 22, the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln crossed the straits with an escort of a guided-missile cruiser, two destroyers, a British frigate, and a French vessel. Moreover, the US Navy has issued a no bid contract to upgrade the troop carrier USS Ponce, which was previously slated to be decommissioned, into a floating base from which helicopters and navy seal teams can be launched. While Saudi Arabia claims they will increase oil production to compensate for the oil production that will be lost if the straits are closed, the US and EU cannot afford to\nThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\ntake any chances.   The undeclared proxy war that Iran and the Western Powers are fighting can be traced back to Iran’s nuclear program. Fox News reports that Iran will have “20% concentration of enriched uranium by next month.’ Fox News says, “that level of enrichment is not used for energy production but towards weapons development.” Assuming this is true, if anyone doubted that Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, it is now that much harder for him or her to do so. This news is particularly frightening for the nation of Israel since Iran and Israel are sworn enemies and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has repeatedly said that he would wipe Israel off the face of the map. With diplomatic initiatives to encourage Iran to cease their nuclear development program having failed over the past decade the western powers are now turning to economic sanctions and possibly military action to halt Iran’s nuclear program. The sanctions that the US and the EU plan to impose on Iran would bar the buying of Iranian oil. This would cripple the oil-based Iranian economy. Thus Iran’s threats of closing the Straits of Hormuz are a measure to not only delay the imposing of the sanctions, but also to give themselves more time to develop a nuclear bomb. For the most part the Iranians have gotten what they wanted as President Obama is waiting until the spring to decide whether or not he should\ngo through with the sanctions. Reports that the United State’s bunker busting bombs might not be effective if used against Iran’s underground nuclear facilities further strengthens Iran’s position. However, the United States still appears to be willing to use them. The US has reportedly given out contracts to strengthen the bombs and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey recently traveled to Israel. It is widely assumed that if an air strike were to be enacted against Iran’s nuclear facilities it would be Israel who would carry them out. Making the whole situation that much more complex, earlier in January Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, one of the chief Iranian nuclear scientists, was killed when two motorcyclists planted a bomb on his car in the Iranian capital city of Tehran. It is widely believed that Israel is responsible for this assassination, but the Israelis refuse to comment. Undoubtedly, Iran will use this assassination to try to gain leverage in the UN. The US has leverage of its own. During January the US Navy rescued a number of Iranian ships from pirates in the Persian Gulf. Going forward it will be interesting to see if the sanctions are successful. There still are questions as to whether or not an air strike can be successful against Iran. If all fails in the end and Iran ultimately obtains nuclear weapons, the world will likely turn into a much scarier place.\n“With diplomatic initiatives to halt Iran’s nuclear development program having failed over the past decade, the western powers are now turning to economic sanctions and possibly military action instead.”\n27\nFeatures During January the U.S. Navy rescued a number of Iranian ships from pirates in the Persian Gulf. However, this is not a significant point of leverage for the U.S. since Iran is a consistent violator of human rights. For example, Iran sentenced Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani to stoning for allegedly committing adultery. Iran has also sentenced ex-U.S. marine Amir Mirzaei Hekmati to death for spying while he was in Iran visiting his grandparents. It was not until September that Iran released two American hikers whom Iran accused of espionage for one million dollars bail. It is likely that they never even crossed the Iraq-Iran border; rather, Iran probably captured them close to the border in Iraq. In terms of violence against its own people, Iran brutally crushed the peaceful Green Revolution in 2009. Thus it is highly likely that Iran is not going to extend an olive branch just because the U.S. rescued some Iranian sailors from pirates. If Iran were a weak and unimportant state, it is likely that the west would have laughed at Iran’s pronouncements about closing the Straits of Hormuz. If Iran was a weak nation, Iran probably would never have threatened to close the straits. However, Iran is an extremely dangerous nation with a large army and large oil deposits. Iran’s economy is about 40% reliant on oil revenues and Iran is OPEC’s second largest oil exporter, exporting four million barrels each day. Most of the oil is exported to Europe and Asia. Over the past decade Russia and China\nwww.mizozo.com\n28\n“Iran has proven itself to be a rogue nation, consistently supporting terrorism and attempting to undercut American influence.”\nhave supported Iran, generally blocking sanctions and resolutions in the UN that would hurt Iran. Iran has proven itself to be a rogue nation. Iran has consistently supported terrorism and tries to undercut American influence. There have been media reports that Afghan President Hamid Karzai has accepted payments from Iran totaling over one million dollars. Iran is known to funnel money and weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine and Gaza. Both organizations are classified as terrorist organizations by the U.S. State Department. Moreover, Iran is a strong supporter of Bashar al-Assad’s repressive regime in Syria. Some estimates for the current death toll in Syria as a result of the Syrian government’s crackdown are as high as 6,000 people. A 2009 U.S. intelligence report estimated that Iran could obtain nuclear weapons by 2013, although some estimates have Iran obtaining nuclear weapons even earlier. Iran’s nuclear program appears to have received immeasurable help from the Russians, who significantly helped build the Bushehr I nuclear reactor that opened in 2011. Western nations fear Iran’s obtaining nuclear weapons due to Iran’s not recognizing Israel, its tensions with the Sunni states, in particular Saudi Arabia, and its known relations and support for terrorist groups. The West fears that Iran will directly use nuclear weapons against Israel or the Sunni states, or that Iran will give nuclear weapons to\nterrorist groups that would do the same. While the U.S. sanctions passed in December that require U.S. banks to seize and freeze the assets of the Iranian Central Bank will go into effect February 13th, the EU says it will only ban Iranian oil imports starting in July. While Iran does almost no business with the U.S., Iranian oil is traded in US dollars and the Iranian oil industry secures credit through the Iranian Central Bank. Thus the United States’s sanctions will make it that much harder for Iran to sell oil. The United States hopes that with a drastic decrease in oil revenues Iran will be forced to halt its nuclear program. However, it might be already too late for the sanctions to work and Israel’s fears of an Iranian nuclear bomb might come to fruition this summer. In 20 years, the Straits of Hormuz standoff will likely be seen as a small facet of Iran’s march to build a nuclear weapon and the West’s struggle to prevent the rogue state from going nuclear. In the meantime, Iran’s threats to close the Straits have been successful, with the U.S. delaying sanctions for almost two months. While Iran would close the Straits if it could, its threats appear to be just a means to delay the enactment of sanctions and to provide more time for the development of a nuclear weapon. Moreover, the sanctions might not even be the deciding factor in whether or not Iran obtains nuclear weapons. In a recent Washington Post article, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that Israel will attack Iran’s nuclear program this spring. If Israel does and fails then only a lack of determination will stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon; U.S. sanctions may slow Iran down, but either Iran’s capacity to build a nuclear bomb must ultimately be destroyed or the effects of the sanctions must prove so crippling that the Iranian government will be forced to cave into the West’s demands. Iran may calculate that it is best to let the people suffer under the sanctions and that once a nuclear bomb has been developed, the nation will have the leverage to force the West to back off sanctions.

In a free capitalist society, the price of any commodity is determined solely by the supply and demand for that product. The price of Middle Eastern oil is currently not appraised at its fair market value as a result of the immense number of manipulative variables that exist. The United States government is entirely responsible for one of the major reasons Middle Eastern oil is overvalued. Economic embargoes and sanctions upon oil-rich countries in the Middle East amplifies the price per barrel since the government is restricting the supply of oil while the demand remains constant. The United States underestimates the enormous effect that sanctions and restrictions on free trade have upon the price of oil. In 1979, The U.S. initiated a major sanction on an oil rich country. The government prohibited all economic trade with Iran, which resulted in a 249% increase in oil costs. This sanction still exists today, and since Iran is the fourth largest producer of oil in the world, it continues to overvalue American oil imports. The monopolization of oil by the\nThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nFeatures\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Counties (OPEC) coupled with their consistent, direct, and effective manipulation of both production and distribution of oil has left America with astounding non-market value prices. OPEC represents twelve countries and collectively controls 40.4% of the entire world’s production of oil. As a group, OPEC decides the amount of oil that each of its member countries will export. Generally, OPEC will authorize the export of almost enough oil to cover the United States’ public demand. They sell enough oil to maintain themselves and their countries, but the price of oil rises with their actions. However, the amount that OPEC trades has no correlation to the availability or actual supply of oil located in OPEC countries. Therefore, OPEC overvalues oil by manipulating the available supply to the United States but leaving the real total supply in reserves. Another tactic that Middle Eastern oil companies and governments both exploit is fear. Ultimately, supply and demand determine the price of a commodity. An anticipated reduction in supply causes higher demand and consequently higher prices. The Middle East corporations and governments fabricate this anticipated reduction in demand by citing irrelevant political and military conflicts as threats to the total production of oil. The most com-\nThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nmon conflict associated with rising oil prices is the Israel-Palestine dilemma. In 2002, violence between Israel and Palestine escalated with more fatalities than at any other point in the engagement previously. This conflict drove oil prices to climb 65.9% in 2002 alone from 2001. It would seem perfectly sensible that when two oil exporters are in conflict, the supply is reduced and the price goes up. The contradiction is that Israel and Palestine combined export less than 0.01% of the world’s oil. The skyrocketing of oil prices cannot be attributed to a change in actual demand since Israel and Palestine export such an insignificant amount of oil. Rather, Middle Eastern oil companies are able use the Israel-Palestine violence as a justification to release poor supply predictions that consequently cause the upward pull in the price. The U.S. needs to take the necessary steps to both reduce the price of foreign oil in the short-term and minimize its dependency on such oil due to the inherently high price. The first step is to remove the sanctions and embargoes on Middle Eastern nations and to encourage global free trade. Once this is done, the U.S. will have access to a heightened supply of oil, which would cause the price per barrel to fall. Oil is a diminishing resource. Not only is there a limited number of oil deposits, but also the Uppsala Hydrocarbon\nDepletion Study Group predicted that oil production would peak in 2018. The United States’ dependence on foreign oil will automatically diminish because of the nature of the market. As oil production begins to decline, the price greatly increases due to the reduced supply and the aforementioned price manipulations. Eventually, the price of oil will be higher than the price of alternate forms of energy, and the United States’ dependency will fall to nothing as Americans are forced by cheaper prices to utilize alternate forms of energy. The Middle East oil companies and governments force the overvaluing of Middle Eastern oil by ensuring perpetual diplomatic conflicts, fronting price inflation with irrelevant violence, and monopolizing the industry. Though, ultimately the heightened oil prices will force Americans to reduce reliance on foreign oil and oil as a whole, in favor of alternate forms of energy. HMR\n31\niran samantha rahmin\nI\nn the 1960s, Iran created its first nuclear program. Since then, nuclear weapons have become a contentious issue. In 1968, Iran agreed to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a landmark international treaty with the goal of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and achieving nuclear disarmament. Luckily, Iran’s first nuclear program officially ended in 1979 when revolution spread through the nation. But, the question remains: has Iran lived up to the obligations in its treaty? Worldwide suspicions grew in the 1990s. In 2002, documents were found revealing Iran’s secret nuclear program. President Mohammed Khatami’s government promised to suspend work on uranium enrichment and allow more inspections by the International Atomic Agency. Consequently, in retrospect, we know Iran could not be trusted. Therefore, over a decade later, why hasn’t the United States resolved this problem with Iran with means other than diplomacy and sanctions? President Obama spent his early years in office proving diplomacy’s failure. Unwilling to compromise, Iran backed out of a tentative agreement to ship Uranium to be enriched elsewhere. The United States continued to look into Iran’s nuclear program. In September 2009, American intelligence agencies found that Iran had enough nuclear fuel to make a nuclear weapon, but not a bomb. Iran purposefully declined to take the critical final steps to make a bomb. Iran has kept a stockpile of Uranium, more of which would need to be enriched to make a bomb. The United States, allied with Russia, China,\n32\nis a threat.\nBritain, France, and Germany, convinced Iran to agree to export most of its Uranium for processing. Unsurprisingly, just before this exportation was scheduled to happen, Iran rejected the deal. Iran did not trust the West. Yet, the West is always willing to give Iran a second chance. In February 2010, Western suspicions were confirmed. For the first time ever, the United Nations’ nuclear inspectors declared that they had extensive evidence of Iran’s futile activities, one of which included Iran’s military’s development of a nuclear warhead. Yet despite these findings, Iran was unwilling to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Russian and Chinese diplomats worked to urge Iran’s government to accept a United Nations plan on uranium enrichment during meetings in Tehran. Iran refused. This event proves that we cannot count on Iran to respond to diplomatic negotiations. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that Russia and China now agreed to work with the United States imposing new sanctions on Iran. In June of 2010, the UN Security Council also voted to impose a new round of sanctions on Iran. After months of debate, President Obama proclaimed that he was delivering “the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government.” These sanctions were imposed against military purchases and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ trade and financial transactions. In retrospect, while these sanctions may have slowed Iran’s nuclear program and disrupted banking and export related economic functions, they did not meet their goal of permanently\nw stopping Iran’s nuclear program. Subsequently, even more sanctions have been imposed on Iran. This November, Western powers worked to prevent Iranian banks from being part of the international financial system. The United States went even farther, proposing sanctions on Iran’s nuclear, petrochemical, and oil industries. These sanctions take away the power of the Iranian government to refine oil or invest in its petroleum industry. In an attempt to prove its power over Western nations, Iran retaliated. Iran threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil transit point. If Iran carries out this threat, the price of oil could immediately rise over 50% of its current price. As a consequence, the United States worked to isolate Iran’s central bank as well as Iran’s three largest oil customers, Japan, South Korea, and China. Saudi Arabia and other oil producers promised to make up for any gap in the supply of oil. President Obama used some unknown, secret way to communicate to Iranian leaders that closing the Straight would provoke an American response. With tensions high, American allies, such as Israel, declared that any attack on Iran because of nuclear weapons was still very unlikely. On Monday, January 23rd, 27 of the nations in the European Union banned Iranian oil imports. All these nations promised that they would not sign oil contracts with Iran and that existing oil contracts would end by July. By “oil” these nations have agreed not to import crude oil, petroleum, and other The Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\n.\nnow ! now Features\nwe must act chemical products. Importantly, the Iranian national bank will still be frozen within the European Union. In the heat of decisions pertaining to how to deal with Iran, an unidentifiable motorcyclist attached a bomb to an Iranian scientist’s car. The Iranian scientist was killed. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps threatened retaliations. Clearly, the atmosphere surrounding nuclear programs in Iran is incredibly tense. The tension is revealed with the sudden, mysterious death of Iranian scientists and with the harsh sanctions imposed on Iran by Western powers. Conveniently, in this uneasy atmosphere, Iran announced that the country was prepared to start a second uranium enrichment site. Buried 30 feet under concrete and surrounded by air defenses, the current uranium enrichment site in Natanz is very resistant to airstrikes. However, the new uranium site is reported to be even more apt to fending off airstrikes. The CIA has tried to destroy Iran’s nuclear program by cutting off the nation’s supply lines. Though, this tactic is not working. Again, the United States is looking towards negotiations with Iran. In January, Iran agreed to resume talks with America, Russia, France, China, Britain, and Germany. Nevertheless, Iranian President Ahmadinejad said that the new sanctions could not force Iran to end its nuclear program. Ultimately, this statement and Iran’s reaction has many diplomats wondering: Is Iran just buying time? If Western nations do not react to nuclear threats, one of Iran’s weapons will be detonated on Western soil. With tensions this high, an event of conflict of some sort The Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nis inevitable. America has exhausted all possibilities for diplomacy. As sanctions fail us, America has two options. America can agree to live with an Iran that has a thriving nuclear program. Or America can use the force of our own weapons to destroy Iran’s nuclear program. There are many counter arguments to bombing Iran. For example. retaliations in the form of nuclear warfare by Iran is a possible risk. However, if America waits to bomb Iran, these risks will amplify. The only thing worse would be if Iran beats us to the punch. Considering that an unstable country with a nuclear weapon is rather dangerous, America must act in the best interest of the citizenry. It is time for our Department of Defense to demolish Iran’s nuclear program. The military can attack both the Natanz facility and Fordo, another enrichment site carved\ninto Iran’s mountainside. Since American weapons are so accurate that civilian causalities are not an issue. Since we have no formal contact with Iran, foreign relations should not be an issue. Yet, if we postpone bombing, the country will become more unified and build even more secret nuclear facilities. Of course, this argument neglects that Iran already is a country unified around a nuclear program with underground nuclear facilities. Alternatively, there is every indication that the situation in Iran will worsen if America keeps waiting for and talking to Iran. One of Iran’s 56 foot-tall, deadliest weapons, the shabab-3, is paraded around banners reading, “Wipe Israel off the Map.” It is irresponsible of our government to ignore these signals and let Iran’s nuclear program continue thriving. HMR\n33\nFeatures\nIsrael’s ism Sex by samuel fisch I\nremember a story my grandmother used to tell me of a disturbing incident when she was in Israel with her daughter. My grandparents and their daughter were quietly walking through an ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem. Suddenly, a group of Orthodox men dressed in full traditional black attire appeared and began to throw rocks and stones at my aunt because of the clothing she was wearing. She was wearing jeans, which was an inappropriate style of dress for a young woman in that neighborhood. My grandparents and aunt quickly left the area, and luckily, no one was harmed. Although this story happened thirtyfive years ago, it appears that some things have not changed in Israel. Recently, international media outlets have placed almost as much emphasis and headline space on the recent happenings regarding the discrimination against women in Israel as they have on the ongoing Pales-\n34\ntinian-Israeli conflict. The Western and Israeli media have recently publicized various incidents of discrimination by the ultra-Orthodox against women in Israel. In Beit Shemesh, a group of ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jews—known in Israel as Haredi—have stoned, taunted, cursed and even spat on an eight-year-old Jewish girl because her clothing did not comply with their modest ultra-Orthodox dress code. The girl is the daughter of two American immigrants, both of whom are now practicing Orthodox Jews themselves, living in an ultra-Orthodox community. Another tale: extremists in Beit Shemesh removed every public bench from the community during a nighttime raid, for the sole purpose of preventing women from sitting outside in the street with their children. Yet another example exists: in Jerusalem, ultra-Orthodox extremist vandals blacked out billboards with advertisements featuring female faces. Also, wom-\nen are expected to sit in the back of public buses that serve ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, physically separating these women from the men in ultra-Orthodox communities. These examples of oppression of women by the ultra-Orthodox in Israel are neither new nor unique, as this type of discrimination started centuries ago in these sects. The blatant discrimination against women in Israel by the ultra-Orthodox is abhorrent, disgusting, and unacceptable. However, some of the Western media has inaccurately portrayed the various incidents of gender inequality in Israel as equal to or greater than the mistreatment of women in many Islamist-ruled Muslim countries surrounding Israel and also as reflective of the role of women in Israeli society generally. While these incidents of discrimination against women in Israel by the ultra-Orthodox are inexcusable, they are inextricably linked to the larger societal issue in Israel of the power The Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nFeatures\nand role of the ultra-Orthodox in Israel’s government and the country. These situations are not at all illustrative of the relatively advanced role of women in Israel. The gender discrimination in many Islamist-ruled Muslim countries is sponsored and dictated by government officials and religious leaders who rule those countries. For example, in Saudi Arabia women are not allowed to drive and women who attempted to publically drive cars were brutally beaten by Saudi men. Over forty-two percent of women over the age of fifteen in Turkey have experienced sexual or physical abuse sometime in their lives. Worst of all, women and girls in Iraq are still subject to forced prostitution and much domestic abuse. Most shockingly, areas in northern Iraq still practice female genital mutilation. These examples reveal the appalling nature of discrimination against women, which is more extreme than the discrimination occurring in Israel. Most imporThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\ntantly, unlike in Israel, the mistreatment of women in Muslim countries is condoned by the government. Unlike the religious and government leaders in Muslim countries, Israel’s government strongly disagrees with and takes powerful action against acts of discrimination towards women. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in a recent speech that Israel “won’t accept spitting on people in the street just because someone doesn’t approve of their apparel,” and that Israel’s “public sphere is open and safe and will remain so.” Rabbinic leaders of even some of the more Orthodox sects in Israel have similarly spoken out against the utterly abusive behavior of the ultra-Orthodox fanatics in Beit Shemesh. In fact, the vast majority of Israeli citizens hold women as equals. Israel is particularly notable for women’s equality and the lack of a “glass ceiling.” A woman is the head of Israel’s Supreme Court and\nfive women just graduated from the Israeli Air Force’s distinguished pilot flying course. Women and men fight side by side in the Israeli army and have always been in combat together. Although there are segments of Israeli society that mimic the harsh treatment of women in Muslim countries, Israel is a modern, thriving Western democracy where the vast majority of women can attain roles in society that women in Islamist-Muslim countries can only dream of achieving. Although the issue of discrimination against women by some of the most radical ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel is alarming and inexcusable, this gender discrimination is in no way reflective of the role of women in Israeli society and is in no way equal to or greater than the barbaric oppression of women in some of Israel’s Muslim neighbors.

It thus has been surprising to many that the uprising in Syria that began as a part of the Arab Spring movement has become such a prolonged struggle, despite continued violence against the Syrian people by President Bashar al-Assadâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s autocratic government. The Assad family has been in power in Syria for over forty tears, with much of that time being characterized by a loosely defined state of â&#x20AC;&#x153;emergency lawâ&#x20AC;?, which the government has used to justify the suspension of almost all constitutional protections for its citizens. In March of 2011, Syrians finally began an uprising against their government, influenced by neighboring protests and organized in response to the torture of several anti-government graffiti artists. At first, governmental reform seemed like it was The Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nFeatures\n“Despite the many problems and brutalities the Syrian movement has faced, the resolve of the people has remained strong.” within reach, with President Assad hinting at some movement towards a less autocratic government. However, as time has progressed, there have been increasingly more violent military crackdowns against the protests. The Syrian government has alienated itself from the rest of the Arab world through its violent actions, with strict sanctions being imposed by the Arab League. Syrian soldiers have even begun to defect towards the resistance movement, lending the Syrian protesters some military power with which to fight back against Assad’s crackdowns. Arab League observers have been allowed in the country in order to try to quell Central Observer the violence and provide a more accurate picture of the situation, but so far their presence has had no notable effect. President Assad has shown no desire to stop his violent crackdowns, and erroneously continues to blame the violence that has arisen against the protests on a foreign conspiracy. Despite the many problems and brutalities the Syrian movement has faced, the resolve of the people has remained strong. They have continued to protest against their tyrannical The Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\ngovernment, and have even won some international support. Criticism of the Syrian government has come even from those nations with which Syria is traditionally allied, such as Jordan, Turkey, and Russia. Still more action and determination is necessary, however, if the Syrian protesters are to achieve their avowed goal of ousting Bashar al-Assad and creating a new, more democratic gov-\nernment. The protesters must continue to rebel against the atrocities committed by Assad’s unforgiving regime, and to receive international attention for it. So far, they have done an admirable job of exercising their natural political right to self-determination, and of staying strong in the face of extreme adversity. It is impossible for the Syrian people to overthrow Assad’s government solely by their own will, however. Assad has not responded to any of\ntheir demands thus far, and it is highly unlikely that he will do so in the future. However, if there is continued international pressure, then perhaps Assad might attempt to end his government’s isolation from the rest of the international community. More specifically, the United Nations and its member states need to take decisive action. They must impose strict economic and diplomatic sanctions, so as to make staying in power even more detrimental to Assad and to weaken his sway over any remaining supporters. Furthermore, the international community must continue to denounce Assad’s actions and the legitimacy of his government, thereby weakening international relations with Syria, and greatly decreasing any benefits that Assad would receive from staying in power. If the international community fully takes into account the rights of the Syrian people, then perhaps the Syrian people will attain the political freedom that they so righteously desire. HMR\n37\nEurope\nwilliam ellison\nill Europe be able to recover from its enormous economic problems? Hopefully, for the sake of both the European nations and the world, yes. But even if the Euro Crisis itself is resolved, it is imperative that many European countries restructure and reform their economies to not only prevent another future crisis, but also to enable Europe to regain its economic strength in the face of the growing BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). As the world\n38\nbecomes increasingly economically interdependent, Europe’s reclaiming economic might will enable it to compete with emerging economic powers in other parts of the globe. In addition, Europe’s regaining economic vitality will benefit all of its trading partners across the globe. In particular, European economic renewal will benefit the United States, as we are closely allied to the European countries. One of the first key areas to address in order to revive Europe’s economy is to fix the ever-increasing gap between Europe’s more competitive\nrich northern nations and the more spending-oriented southern countries. British economist Ian Kernohan claims that in the long term, economically weaker European countries such as the PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) will continue being uncompetitive and will become even less competitive compared to the stronger northern European nations unless they reorganize their economies. Dutch investment firm Robeco opined in a recent statement, “Europe is working on a solution to the debt crisis, but this does not diThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nEconomics rectly solve the current problems in the southern European countries.” While trying to solve the Euro Crisis, European leaders have generally not considered how to use the crisis to improve their economies, as Germany has with past crises. Politicians in southern European countries, such as Greece, Portugal, and Spain, are focusing too much on cutting spending and increasing taxes, and not focusing on what is more important: diverting considerable amounts of resources to reenergizing the most basic elements of their economies, so that they can be more competitive with northern European countries and other stronger economies, such as those of China and Russia. Developing and maintaining severe budgetary discipline will not be enough to solve Europe’s problems, according to major economists.\nThe European countries could utilize the crisis to reconstruct their economies by adopting policies of better resource allocation. The European countries could utilize the crisis to reconstruct their economies by adopting policies of better resource allocation. “In one sense, the resources – both human and natural – of Europe are not much different than before the crisis, so our potential is not that different,” Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate, stated in an interview. “But what’s clear is that misguided policies and market failures are leading Europe not to use its resources well, by not investing in people and capital, or improving technology, in a way that will help them be more competitive with what’s going on in Asia.” Another aspect in reforming European economies is the The Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nEuropean governments’ finding ways to increase productivity and have an industrious work force. Increasing the number of work hours will not solve the problems, as Greeks with full-time employment work an average of 42 hours a week, Portuguese workers 38 hours, and German workers just over 35 hours a week, according to Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency. Despite these differences, a recent Eurostat index of labor productivity provided Germany a mark of 105, Greece a 94.8 and Portugal a 76.4. Further, European countries need to decrease the strictness of the regulations on their economies, as this scares investors away who may otherwise invest money into the European economies and aid in the creation of jobs. After all, numerous large and midsize companies across the globe are holding unspent cash and are ready to invest it.    There are five main targets that the European Union has already established as goals for 2020: increase employment, innovation, and education, decrease poverty and establish a new energy policy. Regarding employment, the EU’s goal by 2020 is that 75% of people between the ages of 20 and 64 will be employed. The EU desires that 3% of its gross domestic product (GDP) will be invested in both research and development/innovation. The EU also aims for 20% of its energy to be from renewable sources and for a 20% growth in energy efficiency. As for education, the EU wishes to decrease school dropout rates to below 10%. Next, by 2020 there should be 20 million fewer citizens in or at risk of poverty. Furthermore, the EU wants greenhouse gas emissions to be between 20% and 30% lower than they were in 1990. These positive goals are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. Educational enhancements will help increase employment and decrease poverty. Additional R&D/ innovation in conjunction with more effective resources will allow the EU to become more competitive and produce more jobs. And finally, financing in better technology and machinery\nwww.payplan.com\n39\nEconomics will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and simultaneously generate new business and job openings. The Euro Zone has so far muddled its way through its debt crisis by using the European Central Bank to provide a spark for the economy by printing money and buying debt, but Europe is now reaching the edge of a cliff, over which Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and even the entire Euro Zone may fall. 2011 has been quite a\nbe resolved soon, as the southern European countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain try to deal with enormously high costs and significantly weakened economies. Standard & Poor’s has recently downgraded the ratings of not only France, but also Italy, Spain, Austria, Cyprus, Portugal, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia.

Furthermore, as the emerging and strengthening BRIC economies have to start paying more attention to their populations and domestic issues, and have less time to focus on global trade, Europe can try to at least catch up if not get a step ahead. While the European countries for centuries were world powers that collectively ruled a gigantic percentage\nThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nof the worldâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s population and land, and while Europe collectively is still an extremely potent economic force, the individual European countries\nThe European countries should settle their differences and resolve the Euro Crisis. are giving way to the larger (both in terms of land and population) BRIC countries. Except for Germany, the once feared European powers such as the United Kingdom, France and Italy,\nthat divided up the world, are now not of nearly as crucial importance on a world economic scale. Of course, Europe does not need to rule the world again, but as our closest allies and trading partners, it would be beneficial for them and for the United States if they could reclaim some of their previous economic life.   The European countries should settle their differences and resolve the Euro Crisis. They should then look towards the future by pursuing the goals that have already been put in place and restructuring their economies to become more competitive and secure.

Bowl commercial spots not only to draw customers, but to shows prestige and prowess. But are purchasing these obscenely expensive amounts of commercial slots economically sound?   Most people watch the Superbowl for football, but some people disregard the actual sport and only tune in for the commercials. If one\n42\nwatches the Super Bowl and pays close attention to the commercials, one will see a trend in the companies buying these expensive air slots and in the actual elements of the commercial. Every year PepsiCo cranks out a multitude of commercials for the Super Bowl. Last year alone they produced 6, 30-second commercials, good for a total of 21 million dollars spent on advertising in one night. Although that is negligible in proportion to PepsiCo’s annual revenue it is still a large amount to spend on one night of advertising. PepsiCo is paying $21 million dollars to attempt to get 111 million people’s attention for a mere 180 seconds. The average American will spend around $151 on PepsiCo products a year. If each of the 111 million people who saw PepsiCo’s Super Bowl ads spent around $5.30 on PepsiCo products a year then the company will break even on their Super Bowl advertising investment. This is a low-risk high-reward system that PepsiCo is implementing.

Last year, 111 million Americans tuned into the Super Bowl, becoming the highestrated night in television history. And this is exactly what companies drool over every year –hundreds of millions of consumers, glued to the TV, easily impressionable.

Companies seek Super\nThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nEconomics\nAre They Worth it? ing the Super Bowl. Making an attractive advertisement has a direct correlation to profitable Super Bowl ads, which ensures either risqué, or downright absurd Super Bowl ads appearing throughout the night. Reoccurring themes from companies such as GoDaddy, a domain name hosting service, uses sex appeal to attract the viewer to remember the ad. Companies also use preposterous and outlandish humor to ingrain their product in the consumer’s mind the next time they decide to buy a bag of chips, search for a new car, or show up to the movies. PepsiCo implements a system that not only benefits them in labor and filming expenses, but the effort and creative genius it takes to concoct a memorable advertisement. For Doritos (owned by PepsiCo), a year round contest has fans and aspiring advertisement producers create ads, which have the chance to be played during the Super Bowl. On Doritos’ website, people who visit can vote on the best and the top 4 commercials will be aired during the big game. The one that receives the most buzz after and during the game will not only yield PepsiCo large profits, but the creator of that commercial will be hired to do the advertisements for Doritos for the rest of the year. This is a beneficial system on all ends and is an obvious example of companies taking advantage of their massive fan base, while taking a large burden off of their shoulders in production of an otherwise expensiveto-create commercial.   This year the Super Bowl ads should be as impressive as ever, with companies bringing back memorable ad campaigns such as the eTrade talking baby and GoDaddys seductive lineup of commercials.

Assuming the investor hasnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t held this position for long should, he or she sell it or not? The answer is absolutely not; the reason is that by the time this person reads the headline, his stock would have already dropped to a level that the market deems correct factoring in this new headline. Basically, if he or she sold the stock based on that information, it would be sold he at a price that would already reflect and factor in this new headline. The investor would actually be losing money because the stock has already gone down from this headline, and what this person would be doing is selling it after the price reflects the news.\n44\nThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nEconomics Let’s talk about another example. As everyone probably knows Apple had a blowout quarter to end fiscal 2011. So in the trading hours that followed, Apple stock went up about 6%. This 6% gain means that, factoring in the news, the professionals on Wall Street value the stock at a price that is 6% higher after this news came out. Should you buy Apple stock after this news comes out? Theoretically, no, because all you will be doing is buying at a price reflecting the report. The reason this is a bad idea is because investors buy stocks ultimately because they think other people will buy the stock, so that the value of the stock goes up. So basically if you bought Apple stock after you see this news you will not be ahead of the curve; you will be behind the curve and you will be making money for all those professionals on Wall Street. Now I’m not trying to say that if you invested it after you won’t see gains; you might. But those gains won’t be a result of the news you initially heard. Those gains might happen because of events that you never foresaw, but were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. The reason individual investors shouln’t invest on news (short term investing) is because the professionals on Wall Street know all the news before you, so you will always be behind the curve.

They sit at their desks watching the headlines and they have computer programs trading on it instantaneously. People always tell me about shorting the S&P for a week or buying some\nThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nthat? The answer is no; because they don’t go to school they don’t see the trend. What they see is the quarterly report. So if you invest in Nike seeing that its shoes are becoming more popular you might very well see its stock rise when their quarterly report comes out. This is because you saw the fad first and these fads made Nike\nfrom all the time. For example, you see that all your friends start to have Nike shoes. It is not just a coincidence that just your school has them. Most likely, kids in other schools like them too. Lets say it’s the new fad. Do the professionals on Wall Street know\nhave higher revenue. So when the professionals on Wall Street see the report, they will drive the stock up, but you don’t need to worry at beating the computer program because you already owned shares of the stock. Don’t just hold a stock for a quarter; if you see long term growth potential hold on to the stock for many years to come. Even if the stock goes down you don’t need to worry. If the stock you bought has a good balance sheet and good prospects then the price will always bounce back. As I mentioned earlier, many heard of Apple’s blowout quarter, but what people might not know is that the quarter prior Apple did awfully. For the first time in years it failed to live up to analyst estimates. This pushed the stock down more then 1300 basis points to $367. I held on to the stock because I knew Apple wasn’t going out of style. I still see people going in and out of the Apple store near my house. I still see people on the bus with iPods and iPhones. I wasn’t going to sell the stock after it already went down based on a report. I held on to it and it is currently at $460. This is just one example of why you shouldn’t sell a stock based on headlines, but this happens all the time, in every industry in every stock index.

These bills were proposed by the House of Representatives and the Senate respectively to stop internet piracy, or online copyright infringement. They are meant to enforce measures taken against online piracy by allowing individuals to request court orders against foreign infringement sites, thus prohibiting the sites from doing business with U.S. advertising networks\nThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nor receiving funding from credit card companies.

According to Wikipedia, the site launched its blackout “out of concern that SOPA and PIPA would severely inhibit people’s access to information.” For example, the bills empower the government to accuse a site of copyright infringement, even if the site is unaware that it contains pirated content. For internet service providers like Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia, this aspect of the bills is particularly problematic. Though the\nmajority of the content of these websites is uploaded by users, rather than by the sites themselves, these sites are currently not legally responsible for the entries that their users provide. However, the SOPA and PIPA laws would make these sites responsible for illegal content uploaded by their users, and as a result, Internet service providers would be required to carefully monitor their users’ uploaded entries. Sites like YouTube, which contain thousands of non-pirated videos, could also be shut down even if only a few of their uploads violate copyright infringement laws. On the other hand, pirated music and videos on foreign-based websites can cost media and entertainment companies billions of dollars a year. Though it might not seem like stealing to the average American adult or teenager, uploading, downloading, or even watching infringed movies is actually theft. Until the proposed SOPA and PIPA legislation, the U.S. government had done very little regarding pirated content; currently, Internet service providers are solely respon\n47\nScience & Tech. sible for the content uploaded by the sites themselves. Ultimately, the SOPA/PIPA dispute is a difficult and controversial one. What was just a law protecting the property and hard earned money of movie producers has spiraled into a huge debate. Entertainment companies argue for the protection of property rights, while Internet companies insist on the protection of free speech. But how do we decide which side is right? One way is to uncover the true motives of the Internet companies. If this argument is about free speech for Internet companies, then why would Wikipedia deny its users access to its content in the first place? This act of protest restricts free speech more than the SOPA and PIPA laws ever could. And if, in the extreme case, a site is accused of Internet piracy for hosting pirated content unknowingly, we should be able to trust our justice system to make the right decisions and come to fair conclusions regarding Internet piracy cases, and bear in mind that it is highly unlikely that a website would be unfairly convicted and forced to shut down. In the rare case of a site being shut down unfairly – that is, if a site were shut down without knowing that it contained pirated content - the legislation could be problematic. But in short, if Wikipe-\ndia and Google are simply protesting the free speech that could be limited from this unusual and extreme case, these sites are overreacting. Another factor, money, must be the real fuel powering the protests of major internet companies. Motion picture companies admittedly argue for stopping online piracy to hold onto their profits, but maybe a monetary gain is also behind the SOPA/ PIPA debate for Internet companies. Remember, Internet companies make large profits by directing users to widely visited illegal pirate websites. For Wikipedia, a site that has only thirty-five staff members, none of which edit the site’s entries, it would be expensive, complicated, and inconvenient to hire a larger staff responsible for overseeing and removing so much user-generated content. Though internet companies argue that the online piracy debate is about protecting free speech, maybe this dispute is really about money after all, for both sides. Not to mention, what does Wikipedia’s protest mean for the legitimacy of Wikipedia itself? Wikipedia’s articles are supposed to be unbiased, but if Wikipedia openly opposes SOPA and PIPA on its own website, can we still trust the validity of its entries? Companies like Wikipedia and Google should be trying to find practical\ngroupdiy.com\nThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nScience & Tech. everyeye.it\nways of stopping internet piracy instead of rousing the public into fear and frenzy through publicity stunts. Users of Wikipedia and Google are heavily reliant on these websites in their everyday lives, and to have such essential websites participate in a blackout, or strike by other means, is unsettling to the average online user. The public may identify with Wikipedia and Google for the wrong reasons; Americans depend on these sites and do not want to see them go away. After all, what would we do without Wikipedia and Google? A world without these websites is almost inconceivable. Other individuals support an anti SOPA/PIPA position just so they can continue downloading illegal songs and watch pirated videos for free. Yet Wikipedia and Google have a point; the SOPA and PIPA bills are quite unclear, and do not resolve or appeal to the specific case of a site being shut down if it hosts pirated content unknowingly. But although the SOPA and PIPA bills are slightly flawed, the idea behind them is not. Online piracy is an issue that needs to be addressed by the U.S. government. Perhaps different measures need to be taken to prevent online piracy, and maybe the government needs to follow a different route. But a route must be followed all the same.\nSo what can the government do to stop online piracy? Congress could revise the SOPA and PIPA bills by making them clearer. The consequences of a site that contains pirated content could be changed from the entire site being shut down to just the pirated content being removed. In this way, the sites that heavily rely on user generated content, the majority of which is legal, will not feel victimized, and freedom of speech will be preserved. Still, there are other ways to reduce online piracy besides implementing legislations. Sites like Netflix and Hulu have already been extremely successful streaming videos legally and conveniently, for a reasonable price. Ultimately, Americans need to recognize that online piracy is a problem that needs to be resolved. If Wikipedia and Google choose to protest SOPA and PIPA in particular, that’s one thing. But if they protest any initiative to stop online piracy, they are clearly more concerned with protecting their profits than preserving free speech. If the online piracy dispute is about money, then Wikipedia and Google should just admit it. But disguising a dispute over money as a debate about free speech is just unacceptable. HMR\nA Threat to Free Speech\nO\nhana krijestorac\nn Wednesday, January 18th, protestors on the Internet engaged in a public rebellion against the House of Representatives’ proposed Stop Online Piracy Act, an act deliberately devised to attempt to discontinue the illegal usage of other individuals’ work such as music and movies. The House also presented a counterpart to the SOPA Act called the Protect Intellectual Property Act, or PIPA, mostly sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith. The main difference between the SOPA and PIPA Act is that PIPA also bans the streaming of unauthorized copyrighted content. Through The Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nthese acts the Federal government is trying to limit the amount of foreign-based pirated electronic information that becomes available to U.S.-based websites by blocking all funding, advertisement, or links to these foreign-based websites. So far, a generally bipartisan attempt to stop these bills has been produced, mostly centered on the argument that it would limit one’s right to the freedom of speech, calling the bills too extreme. This would indirectly cause a search-engine type website like Google to disable or censor the links that would come up from the search. This also gives the Federal government the right to prohibit credit card companies from making payments to these websites.\nNot only does this seem a little extreme for individual users, but its disadvantages also branch out to website owners. All user-based websites would be penalized for pirated content posted by a user, shutting down a number of popular social media websites such as Youtube, Facebook, or Twitter. Although these websites have enough revenue to delay this anticircumvention clause, smaller and lesserknown websites do not. This arises from the anti-circumvention clause, which states that if a user posts a link to a pirated website, the website could face a government enjoinment, causing it to be shut down. Although websites like Google and Facebook have enough revenue to delay\n49\nScience & Tech. this anti-circumvention clause, smaller and lesser-known websites do not. Wikipedia used this public relations opportunity only to bring light to the issue of censorship, not just for major websites like Google, but also smaller websites and blogs that we may take for granted. While piracy is an issue that needs to be confronted in the digital sphere, there is already legislation attempting to prohibit it; the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This piece of legislation requires websites to take down infringed material. While copyrights are essential to our system of free information through the Internet, this issue has already been confronted. Naturally, it is fair to rightly credit another individual’s work. As blogger T.J. Stiles phrases it, censoring websites like Google will ruin the free flow of speech afforded by the new digital world. Using this logic, one can conclude that by enacting these bills, the government is indirectly prohibiting the freedom of speech. Another negative aspect of the two bills is that they undermines a person’s individual Internet security by Domain Name System Blocking, a system used to convert the letters that one would type into web browser into a code of numbers. The bills would halt the conversion, making it increasingly simpler for a hacker to obtain user information. Although many preach the dangers of cyber bullying and hacking, the government seems to be indirectly supporting it, which shows the looseness of the bill itself. It seems almost rushed and unplanned, even though they were proposed in May of last year. Not\nonly are the moral implications of the bills being undermined, but also the technicalities of it. Recently we’ve seen a general trend or movement of speaking out against the government through the Occupy Wall Street movement, and now the more official rebellion against SOPA and PIPA. The audacity that websites like Google and Wikipedia have to openly oppose such a bill seems a bit harsh; however, one must understand that the SOPA and PIPA bills are directly threatening their survival and ultimately the usefulness\nAs blogger T.J. Stiles phrases it, censoring websites like Google will ruin the free flow of speech afforded by the new digital world. Using this logic, one can conclude that by enacting these bills, the government is indirectly prohibiting the freedom of speech. of the Internet. On January 18th, individual protestors went to the offices of Sen. Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, both supporters of the bills, hoping to get their message across. The future of SOPA and PIPA still remain unclear, considering that the opposition has increased on a local and federal level. Many senators have backed out of the bill, by noting its immoral implications. According to Nobel-prize winning writer J.M. Coetzee, who has analyzed the history of censorship, the resistance on the war on censorship generally wins. Hopefully with further resistance, SOPA and\nPIPA will be put to rest for good. Although the American people pride themselves on their leniency towards their views on freedom of speech, throughout history we have seen that mainly totalitarian governments perform restrictions like this using covert means. For example, Coetzee reflects on his time spent in South Africa, where the amount of censorship in publications was substantial. Take the Soviet Union during its Stalin years; a society hindered by is overly controlling government. Looking back on these seemingly inferior nations in the respect to their freedom, the United States seems to be going in the same direction of censorship. By implementing these bills, the United States will imitate nations like the Soviet Union or South Africa. Naturally, a resistance formed in the Soviet Union (mostly made by artists and writers) and South Africa, much like Google or Wikipedia are demonstrating. Some have the perception that Wikipedia’s plea for support from viewers originates from fear of losing money. While this is true, the argument for keeping sites like Wikipedia alive is necessary in order to feed the freedom of the digital world. This is not just a scheme for the CEO’s of banks to keep their income; this marks a grander crusade on the government’s need to censor the public, a restriction, as pointed before, that corrupt governments perform. The United States government’s procession into this type of censorship can only mean the worst for the American future.

With 845 million users on Facebook, this business strategy has yet to fail. The creativity and time put into a product like Facebook often creates tension between the business and creative sides of the company, one wanting to look at revenue and the other at innovation, respectively. Facebook succeeds at integrating both sides of the company, by its generating $3.7 billion dollars in ad rev-\nideas such as the “Like” button and or the “News Feed,” where would the website be at this point? As there has been a push for years from investors for Facebook to go public, it can only be assumed that the decision to go public now has been well thought out, factoring in all such issues that may come along with it. It would be hard to deny the economic benefits of going public, but if economic benefits hurt the substance of Facebook, would its users prefer if a select group of individuals pad\n“The question then arises, not necessarily about the financial risks of going public, seen in other highly-anticipated, highly-valued tech. companies like Groupon and Zynga, both of which flopped shortly after going public, but in the drawbacks that outside interest may have on the operations of the social network.” than 1 in 10 people worldwide use Facebook; it is the fourth most visited site in the U.S. and first in ad revenue.

The question then arises, not necessarily about the financial risks of going public, seen in other highly-anticipated, highly-valued tech. companies like Groupon and Zynga, both of which flopped shortly after going public, but in the drawbacks that outside interest may have on the operations of the social network. Investors typically focus on the short-term profits of a company, a strategy CEO Mark Zuckerberg is unlikely to The Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\nenue in 2011. Regardless, Zuckerberg’s awkward stature and mannerisms may not be what investors want from the man who is to be the face of their company. With his long-term approach to business and ⅓ ownership of the company, which creates risk for the company in the case of his death, investor contempt may prompt the investors to push for Zuckerberg to either give up his majority share or leave Facebook. As drastic as this may seem, the reality of going public is that those in charge of running the company give up a portion of their control over its actions. Facebook is giving up its power of total creative expression, taking away its ability to innovate the ways in which its users interact with the site and with each other. If investors opposed and pushed against\ntheir wallets at the expense of Facebook’s creative influence that draws in 907 minutes of usages a day? Facebook shouldn’t risk harming the substance of Facebook. If Mark Zuckerberg really doesn’t care about profit, as he’s previously stated, then he wouldn’t potentially put Facebook in harm’s way or risk losing control of the company, taking away from himself the capability to further perfect what has become so popular around the world. The economic benefits of Facebook going public are vast, but one can only hope that the potential financial gains do not supersede the importance of perfecting a product for the 845 million people that make Facebook the powerhouse that it is. HMR\n51\nNUCLEAR ENERGY OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING\nLOVE BOMB A N D\nT H E\nLAUREN FUTTER\n“A http://fc01.deviantart.net/\nnd in the desert cold men invented the star.” A mere nine words long, Franz Wright’s poem, “The Forties”, describes the invention of the atomic bomb, and offers a glimpse into the public perception of the atomic bomb. Wright remains an omnipresent observer in the poem, though, two words in this poem hint at the author’s opinions of Enrico Fermi, Neils Bohr, Robert Oppenheimer, and others involved in the Manhattan Project: cold men. In the midst of a desert, supposedly in Los Alamos, New Mexico (the sight of the first tests), these men remained “cold”. Though despite the men being cold in the eyes of the author, it cannot be denied that their invention, “the star”, was the opposite. With the technology used to create the bomb, every country has the choice of seeking destruction or using\n52\nthis power for good. Such a decision can be seen in some countries’ use of nuclear power to create reactors to power towns and cities. Countries such as Brazil have vowed to use nuclear energy for purely peaceful purposes. Meanwhile, countries such as Iran have decided to begin nuclear programs and threaten national security. Both of these countries had a choice of how to use this power. Because Iran decided to build an arsenal, it threatens national security, and provoked the United States and other countries to enact sanctions. Brazil, on the other hand, faces no scrutiny for its decision of how to use nuclear power. The simple power and destruction of the bombs is captured in the few remaining photographs taken by photographers who risked their lives in the 1940’s to preserve the sense of fear and awe that the bomb inspired. Most photos of nuclear weapon detonations show the smoke and\ndust after the explosion; however, the military commissioned group of photographers, the Lookout Mountain Laboratory, was able to truly show the power of these weapons. One photograph depicts the detonation milliseconds after the bomb was set off. In the photo, the bomb looks like a sun, which is ironic considering the sun being a symbol of life and the bombs being a symbol of death and destruction. The simplicity of the photograph is immediately striking, and appears to show an immense uncontrolled force that is greater than any scientist that might have conceived the idea of the bomb. Another photo taken in 1953 shows the shadowy silhouettes of photographers as they take pictures of smoke plumes rising from the ground. The way the photographers align themselves is reminiscent of paparazzi trying to get a shot of a famed celebrity. The bomb could also be said to be a celebrity in its own right, able to use its power The Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nScience & Tech. for good or for evil. The end of World War II brought the rise of two world powers: the United States and the Soviet Union. With the rise of two major powers also came conflict. Both the United States and the Soviet Union were interested in amassing a stockpile of nuclear arms, which caused both to see one another as threats to each other’s power. Eventually, several treaties were passed such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a treaty that attempts to halt the spread of nuclear weaponry. Despite the numerous accords passed as a result of the Cold War, the most memorable part of the Cold War could possibly be the pop culture spawned as a result. Acclaimed director Stanley Kubrick directed the movie Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying Love the Atomic Bomb in the midst of Cold War in 1962. The film focuses on the fictional Air Force General Jack D. Ripper who orders his aircrafts to bomb the Soviet Union, thus causing a nuclear war. The film discusses concepts such as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) and the Security Dilemma, the idea that if one country increases their weapons arsenal another country will see it as a threat and build their arsenal, in a way that made these concepts understandable. So, despite the scare of nuclear war, an amazing movie helped explain the crisis at hand. The movie Dr. Strangelove is just an example of the creative potential that arises from\nnuclear weaponry, and it foreshadowed what would come in the future. The 1980’s brought the Reagan administration and the fall of the Berlin Wall, which helped unite the world. It is difficult to believe, in a world that becomes more and more connected with every tweet and status update, that a wall could split the world. Before a Facebook message could spark a revolution like the Arab Spring, it took the threat of nuclear war for change to occur. Eventually though, the peace talks that came from nuclear weapons and the fall of the Berlin wall led to this interconnectedness that allows us to tweet a message to someone halfway around the world. The Clinton Administration furthered these talks amongst nations to promote non-proliferation in North Korea and other countries. Peace talks with North Korea solidified the idea of every country gaining nuclear weapons despite the intent. As the talks continued, other countries began researching nuclear programs and hoping to expand their arsenals, which the United States hoped had peaceful intention. Now it is the twenty- first century and Iran, Israel, and North Korea have been in the news as countries that hope to expand their nuclear programs. President Barack Obama has attempted to assuage fears by hosting a Nuclear Non-Proliferation summit in 2010, but tensions escalate. Iran and Israel have been locked in a series of con-\nflicts, with Israel fearing Iran’s recent increase in their arsenal. Despite this seemingly perpetual conflict between states, there remains hope. Just as the original creation of nuclear weaponry allowed for the creation of poems, photography, and movies, this new wave of nuclear conflict can cause creativity of a different sort. The future of nuclear energy can be either positive or negative depending on the direction the world plans to take. Despite nuclear reactors being better for the environment, many wonder about the sustainability of nuclear energy and whether or not future generations will have to deal with the waste they produce. Additionally, nuclear energy relies on rare elements like uranium, which can only be found in small quantities. Consequently, instead of countries fighting over oil, they will begin to fight over uranium. So, while there are many positive characteristics of nuclear energy, countries cannot solely rely on it. Countries must continue to search for other ways to use the technology originally developed to end World War Two to end energy and economic crisis in a sustainable manner. Nuclear energy does not have to carry the negative connotations that it currently does, the implications that it can carry is the decision of the next generation that will lead peace talks and hopefully light the way to a brighter future. HMR\nwoondu.com\nThe Horace Mann Review | Issue 5\n53\nApps And Us How Mobile Applications Will Threaten the Primacy of the Web sahej suri\nhttp://www.gadgetsee.com/\nThe Horace Mann Review | Vol. XXI\nT\nhe surge for the development of mobile applications on platforms such as the Apple App Store and Android Marketplace has recently caused mobile and tablet users to spend more time on downloadable applications rather than mobile web-browsers. Previously, a study by Flurry Analytics found that the majority of the time users spent on their phone was not through calling or texting but through the Internet. The new technologies that have been incorporated in these applications have strategic advantages to that of the web. As phone manufacturers would like to limit the functions of their web browsers, such as when Apple restricted Flash on its iPhones and iPads, applications on these app stores have become alternates the missing features from the standard web-browser. Perhaps the most consequential aspect of this issue is how mobile developers react to the technology presented to them. An extensive amount of effort has been made to try to incorporate advertisements into web browsers. However, due to the vast amount of bugs that would slow down the mobile device entirely, advertisements have remained relatively unsuccessful on mobile web-browsers. With the addition of advertisements on mobile applications, however, app developers are able to easily insert advertisements onto the pages without needing to access the Internet, as the advertisements will already be placed on the applications during download. In addition, the app business has been more lucrative for developers. Not only do they have the option of having the user pay for the application beforehand, but these advertisements allow them to collect an additional revenue. Although the introduction and rollout of the 4G technology has been relatively successful, the past-faced user is interested in having information at the tip of their fingers without having to enter in a URL and then wait for it to load. With mobile applications, data is much more accessible and convenient. Television and movie streaming are available through applications such as Netflix and Hulu. Facebook, which has traditionally been accessed from computers, has transitioned nicely into the mobile application field. According to Nielsen, Facebook is the most used app on Android, The Horace Mann Review | Issue 45\nScience & Tech. as it has even become more used than the preinstalled apps on Android phones. According to the most recent report form Flurry Analytics, “With Facebook’s recent push into HTML5 with Project Spartan, where apps built for Facebook’s platform can run on top of the Facebook app, instead of requiring the user to launch the iOS app equivalent, this poses a disintermediation challenge to Apple.  As Apple and Google continue to battle for consumers through the operating system and devices, Facebook is demonstrating that it can leverage its hold over consumers at the software level, through the power of the social network, across multiple platforms.” The introduction of technologies such as HTML 5 will cause companies such as Apple and Google to step back from outpacing the rest of their competitors. Adobe was forced to halt their development of Flash technologies into web browsers when Apple resisted to have its products be Flash-compatible. However, the implementation of HTML 5 will ensure that Adobe cuts into the profits of Apple and Google as HTML 5 is able to perform many app-like functions in the web browser. In addition, according to a CNN article, HTML 5 “supports geolocation, makes Web forms easier to fill out on your phone, supports coding scripts that enable custom features, and it\nalso loads multimedia elements faster in Web pages.” This could potentially change the direction for many developers. According to a HTML 5 Report, “The mass migration to HTML5 will eliminate the need to rely on companies like Apple and Google, which take up to 30% of all revenues generated from applications.” HTML 5 is also cross-platform, which makes it convenient for developers to make changes to all versions of their product at once- whether it is geared toward Apple, Google, or other products. The fact of the matter is that since the introduction of various application stores, corporations such as Apple, and Google have been able to attract a wider range of customers. A report by Flurry Analytics stated, “Since 2007, more than 500 million iOS and Android smartphones and tablets have been activated.  By the end of 2012, Flurry estimates that the cumulative number of iOS and Android devices activated will surge past 1 billion.” Applications range from books to games to even video content from major television networks. It is no surprise that people spent more time on mobile applications instead of accessing their mobile browsers in the past year. With the introduction of new technologies such as 4G and HTML 5, perhaps the game will revolutionize again for the better. HMR\nhttp://images.itracki.com/",

                "Shirley Valentine is a one-character play by Willy Russell. Taking the form of a monologue by a middle-aged, working class Liverpool housewife, it focuses on her life before and after a transforming holiday abroad.\n\nPlot\n\nWondering what has happened to her youth and feeling stagnant and in a rut, Shirley finds herself regularly alone and talking to the wall while preparing an evening meal of egg and chips for her emotionally distant husband. When her best friend wins a trip-for-two to Greece, she packs her bags, leaves a note on the cupboard door in the kitchen, and heads for a fortnight of rest and relaxation. In Greece, with just a little effort on her part, she rediscovers everything she had been missing about her existence in England.  She finds so much happiness, in fact, that when the vacation is over she decides not to return, ditching her friend at the airport and going back to the hotel where she'd been staying to ask for a job and to live a newly self-confident life in which she is at last true to herself.\n\nProductions\n\nCommissioned by the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool, the play premiered in 1986, with Noreen Kershaw directed by Glen Walford. Two years later it opened in London's West End at the Vaudeville Theatre, with Pauline Collins directed by Simon Callow. After eight previews, the Broadway production, with Collins again directed by Callow, opened on 16 February 1989 at the Booth Theatre, where it ran for 324 performances. Ellen Burstyn replaced Collins later in the run, and Loretta Swit starred in a US national tour in 1995.\n\nFrom 26 March - 8 May 2010, as part of the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, Meera Syal played Shirley in the production's first London West End revival. A West End transfer of the Menier Chocolate Factory production ran at the Trafalgar Studios from 20 July - 30 October 2010. Meera Syal reprised her role as Shirley.\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n; Awards\n* 1988 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Comedy\n* 1988 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress\n* 1989 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play\n* 1989 Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Actress\n* 1989 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play\n* 1989 Theatre World Award for Outstanding Broadway Debut\n\n;Nominations\n* 1989 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding New Play\n* 1989 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Play \n* 1989 Tony Award for Best Play\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nRussell adapted his play for a 1989 film version, directed by Lewis Gilbert, with Collins again playing the title role."

                "Carnie Wilson (born April 29, 1968) is an American singer and television host, perhaps best known as a member of the pop music group Wilson Phillips.\n\nEarly life and musical career\n\nWilson is the daughter Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and his first wife, former singer Marilyn Rovell of The Honeys. She co-founded Wilson Phillips with her younger sister Wendy and childhood friend Chynna Phillips when they were in their teens. They released two albums, Wilson Phillips and Shadows and Light, which between them sold 12 million copies. The group also charted three No. 1 singles and six top 20 hits in the United States before disbanding in 1993.\n\nCarnie & Wendy Wilson continued to record together, releasing the Christmas album Hey Santa! in 1993. They joined with their father for a critically successful (yet commercially unsuccessful) 1997 album,  The Wilsons. She also sang \"Our Time Has Come\" with James Ingram for the 1997 animated film Cats Don't Dance.\n\nIn 2003, Carnie attempted to launch a solo music career with the album For the First Time. The album featured a remake of the Olivia DiNucci-penned Samantha Mumba ballad \"Don't Need You To (Tell Me I'm Pretty),\" retitled \"I Don't Need You To,\" as its first single. However, the single failed to gain interest and the album was ultimately shelved when Carnie regrouped with Wendy and Chynna as Wilson Phillips in 2004.\n\nReunited, the band released a third album, named California, which appeared on Sony Music's record label. The album featured cover songs primarily from the 1960s and 1970s, and specifically highlights the musical glory days of their parents' California-based musical groups: The Mamas & the Papas and the Beach Boys.\n\nIn 2006, Carnie released an album of lullabies, A Mother's Gift: Lullabies from the Heart,  created shortly after the birth of her daughter Lola. She released her second solo effort in October 2007, a Christmas album entitled Christmas with Carnie  featuring a song written by her husband; \"Warm Lovin' Christmastime\".\n\nTelevision career\n\nFrom 1995–1996, Carnie hosted her own short-lived syndicated television talk show Carnie! The series was launched during the mid-1990s wave of popularity in \"tabloid\" talk shows, which followed the sudden successes of Ricki Lake and Jerry Springer. Former Cosmopolitan Magazine Bachelor-of-the-Month Chris Greeley was a guest on the television pilot. Wilson found the experience a disappointment and a source of professional and personal frustration.\n\nShe later guest-starred on episodes of That 70s Show in 2001 and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch before joining the fourth season (see below) of VH1's Celebrity Fit Club in 2006.\n\nWilson has also been a correspondent on Entertainment Tonight and in 2006 hosted a special on E! entitled 101 Celebrity Slimdowns. Wilson became a cast member of the CMT series Gone Country in January 2008.  In April 2008, she was a cast member of the VH1 series Celebracadabra. In July 2008, she starred in a new show called Outsider's Inn.\n\nShe hosted GSN's new edition of The Newlywed Game, which premiered April 6, 2009, until late 2010 when she was replaced by Sherri Shepherd. \n\nIn addition, a reality show starring Wilson, Carnie Wilson: Unstapled, began airing on Game Show Network on January 14, 2010.  In August of 2011, Wilson became a judge on the ABC show Karaoke Battle USA.\n\nOn January 2, 2012, Wilson appeared on ABC's Celebrity Wife Swap, trading places with actress Tracey Gold for a week.\n\nIn the spring of 2012, Carnie along with her sister Wendy Wilson and childhood best friend Chynna Phillips starred in their own reality show on the TV Guide Network about the rebirth of her band Wilson Phillips. The show, called Wilson Phillips: Still Holding On, logged the journey of the girls getting back together to reform Wilson Phillips on the road, in the studio, and at home as working mothers. A pilot episode aired in November 2011; seven additional episodes aired in April and May 2012.\n\nShe starred in the Chopped: All Stars: Celebrities episode and won.\n\nIn 2013, Carnie became a member of \"Team Rachael\" on the second season of Food Network's Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off. She came in second place to Dean McDermott and won $10,000 for her charity, an Autism research foundation.\n\nShe also frequently fills in as a guest host on CBS's The Talk. It has been rumored that she is in the top of the line as a replacement host if one of the current hosts were to depart.\n\nIn 2015, Wilson played herself as an auto insurance claimant on a Progressive Insurance TV commercial.  On January 28, 2016, it was announced that she is going to be a contestant on The New Celebrity Apprentice (also known as The Apprentice 15 and Celebrity Apprentice 8). \n\nIn July 2016, Wilson Phillips reunited and performed on ABC's Greatest Hits. \n\nPersonal life\n\nMarriage & family\n\nWilson married musician/music producer Rob Bonfiglio in 2000. They have two daughters:  Lola Sofia Bonfiglio, born on April 22, 2005, and Luciana \"Luci\" Bella, born on June 12, 2009. \n\nHer uncles were Dennis Wilson and Carl Wilson. She is cousin to Beach Boys co-founder Mike Love, and his brother, former NBA player Stan Love, as well as Stan's son, Cleveland Cavaliers player Kevin Love.\n\nWeight problems\n\nWilson has had a lifelong battle fighting obesity. During her Wilson Phillips fame, she reached a lifetime weight peak of almost 300 lb.  She was often mocked for her weight by Howard Stern and comedians Julie Brown and Chris Farley.  Dieting was ineffective; she lost some weight only to regain it later. In August 1999, she underwent gastric bypass surgery, which she felt was a life-saving decision. The procedure was broadcast live on the Internet.   As a result, she went from a size 28 to a size 6 and lost 150 pounds. In 2003, Wilson posed nude for Playboy. Carnie later toured TV talk shows and hosted her own infomercial to publicize her satisfaction with the procedure. However, she eventually gained back some weight and ended up as a contestant on the fourth season of VH1's Celebrity Fit Club in 2006. Over the course of the show, Wilson lost 22 pounds, which she eventually gained back.  In May 2008, Wilson was widely ridiculed for her weight gain  and vowed to get back in Playboy shape, and hopefully pose nude for them again. \n\nIn March 2012, Wilson admitted that she had received lap-band surgery earlier that year. \n\nBell's palsy diagnosis\n\nOn March 18, 2013, Wilson disclosed, through Twitter, that she had been diagnosed with Bell's palsy."

                "Aladdin is a 1992 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Aladdin is the 31st animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, and was part of the Disney film era known as the Disney Renaissance. The film was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, and is based on the Arab-style folktale Aladdin and the Magic Lamp from One Thousand and One Nights. The voice cast features Scott Weinger, Robin Williams, Linda Larkin, Jonathan Freeman, Frank Welker, Gilbert Gottfried, and Douglas Seale.\n\nLyricist Howard Ashman first pitched the idea, and the screenplay went through three drafts before then-Disney Studios president Jeffrey Katzenberg agreed to its production. The animators based their designs on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, and computers were used for both finishing the artwork and creating some animated elements. The musical score was written by Alan Menken and features six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Tim Rice, who took over after Ashman's death.\n\nAladdin was released on November 25, 1992 and was the most successful film of 1992, earning over $217 million in revenue in the United States, and over $504 million worldwide. The film also won many awards, most of them for its soundtrack.  The film is considered by many as the best film that came out during the Disney Renaissance.  success led to other material inspired by the film, including two direct-to-video sequels, The Return of Jafar and Aladdin and the King of Thieves, an animated television series of the same name, toys, video games, spin-offs, including a live-action remake about the genie titled Genies, Disney merchandise, and a Broadway adaptation that debuted in 2014.\n\nPlot\n\nA peddler sets up shop in the fictional sultanate of Agrabah, offering to tell the audience about the story of an oil lamp in his possession. Jafar, the Grand Vizier of the Sultan, and his parrot Iago, seek the lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders but is told that only a “diamond in the rough” may enter. Jafar identifies a street urchin named Aladdin as worthy. Aladdin and his pet monkey Abu cross paths with Princess Jasmine, who has run away from the palace, unwilling to be married off to another snobbish suitor. Aladdin and Jasmine become friends and fall in love, but Jafar has Aladdin apprehended, tricking Jasmine into thinking that he was decapitated.\n\nDisguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu, taking them to the Cave and promises to reward them if they retrieve the lamp. Inside, Aladdin befriends a magic carpet. Abu greedily tries to steal a jewel, despite the Cave’s request, and it collapses. Trapped underground, Aladdin rubs the lamp, releasing the Genie trapped inside, who explains Aladdin has become his master and will grant him three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them from the Cave without wasting a wish, and then uses his first to become a prince to be near Jasmine. Jafar, on Iago’s suggestion, plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine, but Aladdin parades into the city as “Prince Ali of Ababwa”. However, Jasmine is unimpressed with Aladdin’s bravado.\n\nDespite his friends advising him to tell Jasmine the truth, Aladdin refuses, believing she would never fall “for some street rat”. He takes Jasmine on a worldwide flight on the carpet, where she deduces his identity, though Aladdin says that he dresses as a peasant to escape the stresses of royal life, which convinces her. Aladdin returns Jasmine home, only to be attacked by the palace guards on Jafar’s orders and nearly drowned, until the Genie rescues him using his second wish. Jafar tries to hypnotise the Sultan into agreeing to his marriage to Jasmine, only for Aladdin to appear and expose Jafar’s schemes. Jafar flees, but notices Aladdin has the lamp, realising who he is.\n\nLearning he will become Sultan, Aladdin has second thoughts about freeing the Genie, believing that without him, he would not be able to keep up appearances. Iago steals the lamp, and Jafar becomes the Genie’s new master. He uses his first two wishes to usurp the Sultan and become the world’s most powerful sorcerer, exposing Aladdin’s lies and exiles him, Abu, and the carpet to a frozen wasteland, though they escape death and return to the palace. Jafar orders the Genie to brainwash Jasmine into falling in love with him, but the Genie reveals he is unable to grant the wish. Jasmine feigns interest to distract Jafar and allow Aladdin to get the lamp, but he is caught.\n\nJafar transforms himself into a giant cobra and ensnares Aladdin, saying he is the most powerful being in the world. However, Aladdin points out the Genie is more powerful, inspiring Jafar to use his last wish to become a genie, only to be sucked into his own lamp as part of the genie’s nature, dragging Iago in with him. The Genie chucks Jafar’s lamp into the Cave of Wonders, and asks Aladdin to use his third wish to regain his royal title. However, Aladdin decides to free the Genie. Learning of Aladdin and Jasmine’s love, the Sultan alters the law to allow his daughter to marry whom she chooses. The Genie leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine celebrate their engagement.\n\nCast\n\n*Scott Weinger as Aladdin, a poor, but kind-hearted Agrabah thief. Weinger sent in a homemade audition tape with his mother playing the Genie,  and after several call backs he found six months later that he had the part.  Aladdin's supervising animator was by Glen Keane. Brad Kane provides Aladdin's singing voice. \n*Robin Williams as The Genie, a comedic genie, with nigh omnipotent power that can only be exercised when his master wishes it. The Genie's supervising animator was Eric Goldberg. Clements and Musker wrote the part of the Genie for Williams, and, when met with resistance, created a reel of Williams' stand-up to animation of the Genie. The directors asked Goldberg to animate a Genie over one of Williams' old stand-up comedy routines to pitch the idea to the actor. The resulting test, where Williams talking about schizophrenia was translated into Genie growing another head to argue with himself, made Williams \"laugh his ass off\" and convinced him to sign on for the role. Williams' appearance in Aladdin (despite his appearance along with Christian Slater and Tim Curry in the early 1992 animated film FernGully) marks the beginning of a transition in animated film to celebrity voice actors, rather than specifically trained voice actors in animated film.  Williams provided many celebrity impressions during recording sessions, which were re-adapted into the fabric of the character. These included Ed Sullivan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, William F. Buckley, Peter Lorre, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arsenio Hall.  Williams also voices the Peddler, a mysterious merchant who appears at the beginning of the film. After promoting useless goods to the audience, he reveals the magic lamp and begins the story of Aladdin. Bruce Adler supplies his singing voice. The scene was completely unscripted — the production left Williams a table with props covered with a sheet and asked him to pull out objects without looking at them and describe them in-character. The double role originally led to the Peddler revealing to be the Genie disguised, but that idea was later dropped. In October 2015, Clements and Musker claimed that the Peddler is actually the Genie's human form.\n*Jonathan Freeman as Jafar, the power-hungry Grand Vizier of Agrabah. Jafar was originally envisioned as an irritable character, but the directors decided that a calm villain would be scarier. Freeman was the first actor cast and spent one year and nine months recording his dialogue. He later readjusted his voice after Weinger and Larkin were cast as he felt \"Jafar had to be seen as a real threat to Aladdin and Jasmine\".  Jafar's supervising animator was Andreas Deja, who tried to incorporate Freeman's facial expressions and gesturing into the character, while Jafar's beggar and snake forms are animated by Kathy Zielinski.\n*Linda Larkin as Princess Jasmine: The princess of Agrabah, who is tired of life in the royal palace. Larkin was chosen nine months after her audition, and had to adjust (or lower) her high-pitched voice to reach the voice the filmmakers were looking for in the character. Jasmine's supervising animator was Mark Henn. Lea Salonga provides Jasmine's singing voice. \n*Frank Welker as Abu, Aladdin's kleptomaniac pet monkey with a high-pitched voice. The animators filmed monkeys at the San Francisco Zoo to study their movements for Abu's character. In the three years it took to record the film, Welker did not meet Weinger or Williams.  Welker also voices Jasmine's tiger Rajah and the Cave of Wonders. Duncan Marjoribanks was the supervising animator for Abu, while Rajah was animated by Aaron Blaise.\n*Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's sarcastic, foul-mouthed parrot assistant. Iago's supervising animator Will Finn tried to incorporate some aspects of Gottfried's appearance into Iago's design, especially his semi-closed eyes and the always-appearing teeth.\n*Douglas Seale as The Sultan, the pompous, but kind ruler of Agrabah, who desperately tries to find a suitor for his daughter Jasmine. Some aspects of the character were inspired by the Wizard of Oz, to create a bumbling authority figure. The Sultan's supervising animator was David Pruiksma.\n*Jim Cummings as Razoul, the Captain of the Guard. He was named after layout supervisor Rasoul Azadani. He and the other guards were animated by Phil Young and Chris Wahl.\n*Charlie Adler as Gazeem: A thief that Jafar sends into the Cave of Wonders at the beginning of the film but is trapped inside for being unworthy. Gazeem was animated by T. Daniel Hofstedt.\n*Corey Burton as Prince Achmed, a snobbish prince who is rejected by Princess Jasmine as her suitor.\n\nProduction\n\nScript and development\n \nIn 1988, lyricist Howard Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of Aladdin. Ashman had written a 40-page film treatment remaining faithful to the plot and characters of the original story, but envisioned as a campy 1930s-style musical with a Cab Calloway/Fats Waller-like Genie.  Along with partner Alan Menken, Ashman conceived several songs and added Aladdin's friends named Babkak, Omar, and Kasim to the story. However, the studio were dismissive of Ashman's treatment and removed the project from development in which Ashman and Menken were later recruited to compose songs for Beauty and the Beast.  Linda Woolverton, who had also worked on Beauty and the Beast, used their treatment and developed a draft with inspired elements from The Thief of Bagdad such as a villain named Jaf'far, an aged sidekick retired human thief named Abu, and a human handmaiden for the princess.   Then, directors John Musker and Ron Clements joined the production, picking Aladdin out of three projects offered, which also included an adaptation of Swan Lake and King of the Jungle – that eventually became The Lion King.  Before Ashman's death in March 1991, Ashman and Menken had composed \"Prince Ali\" and his last song, \"Humiliate the Boy\". \n\nMusker and Clements wrote a draft of the screenplay, and then delivered a story reel to studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg in April 1991. Katzenberg thought the script \"didn't engage\", and on a day known by the staff as \"Black Friday,\" demanded that the entire story to be rewritten without rescheduling the film's November 25, 1992 release date.  Among the changes Katzenberg requested from Clements and Musker were to not be dependent on Ashman's vision, and the removal of Aladdin's mother, remarking, \"Eighty-six the mother. The mom's a zero.\"  Screenwriting duo Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were brought in to rework the story, and the changes they made included the removal of Aladdin's mother, the strengthening of the character of Princess Jasmine, and the deletion of several of the Ashman-Menken songs.  Aladdin's personality was rewritten to be \"a little rougher, like a young Harrison Ford,\"  and the parrot Iago, originally conceived as an uptight British archetype, was reworked into a comic role after the filmmakers saw Gilbert Gottfried in Beverly Hills Cop II. Gottfried was cast to provide Iago's voice.  By October 1991, Katzenberg was satisfied with the new version of Aladdin. As with Woolverton's screenplay, several characters and plot elements are based on the 1940 version of The Thief of Bagdad,   the location of the film was changed from Baghdad, Iraq to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah. \n\nDesign and animation\n\nOne of the first issues that the animators faced during production of Aladdin was the depiction of Aladdin himself.  Director and producer John Musker explains: \n\nHe was initially going to be as young as 13, but that eventually changed to eighteen. Aladdin was designed by a team led by supervising animator Glen Keane, and was originally made to resemble actor Michael J. Fox. During production, it was decided that the design was too boyish and wasn't \"appealing enough,\" so the character was redesigned to add elements derived from actor Tom Cruise and Calvin Klein models.\n\nThe design for most characters was based on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, which production designer Richard Vander Wende also considered appropriate to the theme, due to similarities to the swooping lines of Persian miniatures and Arabic calligraphy.  Jafar's design was not based on Hirschfeld's work because Jafar's supervising animator, Andreas Deja, wanted the character to be contrasting.  Each character was animated alone, with the animators consulting each other to make scenes with interrelating characters. Since Aladdin's animator Glen Keane was working in the California branch of Walt Disney Feature Animation, and Jasmine's animator Mark Henn was in the Florida one at Disney-MGM Studios, they had to frequently phone, fax or send designs and discs to each other. The Magic Carpet is a sentient carpet who is able to fly. Animator Randy Cartwright described working on the Carpet as challenging, since it is only a rectangular shape, who expresses himself through pantomime – \"It's sort of like acting by origami\". Cartwright kept folding a piece of cloth while animating to see how to position the Carpet. After the character animation was done, the carpet's surface design was applied digitally.\n\nFor the scenery design, layout supervisor Rasoul Azadani took many pictures of his hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring was done with the computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave. \n\nMusker and Clements created the Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though Katzenberg suggested actors such as John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy, Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role. Williams came for voice recording sessions during breaks in the shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time, Hook and Toys. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters.  Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match.\n\nThe producers added many in-jokes and references to Disney's previous works in the film, such as a \"cameo appearance\" from directors Clements and Musker and drawing some characters based on Disney workers.  Beast, Sebastian from The Little Mermaid, and Pinocchio make brief appearances,  and the wardrobe of the Genie at the end of the film—Goofy hat, Hawaiian shirt, and sandals—are a reference to a short film that Robin Williams did for the Disney-MGM Studios tour in the late 1980s.\n\nRobin Williams' conflicts with the studio\n\nIn gratitude for his success with Touchstone Pictures' Good Morning, Vietnam, Robin Williams voiced the Genie for SAG scale pay ($75,000), on condition that his name or image not be used for marketing, and his (supporting) character not take more than 25% of space on advertising artwork, since Williams' film Toys was scheduled for release one month after Aladdins debut. For financial reasons, the studio went back on the deal on both counts, especially in poster art by having the Genie in 25% of the image, but having other major and supporting characters portrayed considerably smaller. The Disney Hyperion book Aladdin: The Making of an Animated Film listed both of Williams' characters \"The Peddler\" and \"The Genie\" ahead of main characters, but was forced to refer to him only as \"the actor signed to play the Genie\".   \n\nMusic\n\nComposer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is \"consistently good, rivaling the best of Disney's other animated musicals from the '90s.\"  Menken and Ashman began work on the film together, with Rice taking over as lyricist after Ashman died of AIDS-related complications in early 1991.  Although fourteen songs were written for Aladdin, only six are featured in the movie, three by each lyricist.  The DVD Special Edition released in 2004 includes four songs in early animations tests, and a music video of one, \"Proud of Your Boy\", performed by Clay Aiken,  which also appears on the album DisneyMania 3. \n\nThemes\n\nThe filmmakers thought the moral message of the original tale was not appropriate, and decided to \"put a spin on it\", by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great thing, but eventually becoming a problem. Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be what the person is not – both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble faking to be different people, and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine, who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is.   Being \"imprisoned\" is also discussed, a fate that occurs to most of the characters – Aladdin and Jasmine are stuck to their lifestyles, Genie is attached to his lamp and Jafar, to the Sultan – and is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace, and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees. Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess, being rebellious to the royal life and the social structure,  and trying to make her own way, unlike the princesses who just wait for rescue.\n\nRelease and reception\n\nTheatrical run\n\nA large promotion campaign preceded Aladdins debut in theaters, with the film's trailer being attached to most Disney VHS releases, and numerous tie-ins and licensees being released.  After a limited release on November 13, 1992,  Aladdin debuted in 1,131 theaters on November 25, 1992, grossing $19.2 million in its opening weekend – number two at the box office, behind Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.  It took eight weeks for the film to reach number one at the US box office, breaking the record for the week between Christmas and New Year's Eve with $32.2 million.  The film held the top spot five times during its 22-week run.  Aladdin was the most successful film of 1992 grossing $217 million in the United States and over $504 million worldwide. It was the biggest gross for an animated film until The Lion King two years later.  As of January 2014, it is the thirtieth highest grossing animated film and the third highest grossing traditionally animated feature worldwide, behind The Lion King and The Simpsons Movie.  It sold an estimated 52,442,300 tickets in the US. \n\nCritical reception\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 94% of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 68 reviews, with an average score of 8.1/10. \n\nMost critics' praise went to Robin Williams' performance as Genie, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children \"needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is\".  Warner Bros. Cartoons director Chuck Jones even called the film \"the funniest feature ever made.\" Furthermore, English-Irish comedian Spike Milligan considered it to be the greatest film of all time.  James Berardinelli gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the \"crisp visuals and wonderful song-and-dance numbers\".  Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the comedy made the film accessible to both children and adults,  a vision shared with Desson Howe of The Washington Post, who also said \"kids are still going to be entranced by the magic and adventure.\"  Brian Lowry of Variety praised the cast of characters, describing the expressive magic carpet as \"its most remarkable accomplishment\" and considered that \"Aladdin overcomes most story flaws thanks to sheer technical virtuosity\". \n\nSome aspects of the film were widely criticized. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wrote a negative review, describing the film as racist, ridiculous, and a \"narcissistic circus act\" from Robin Williams.  Roger Ebert, who generally praised the film in his review, considered the music inferior to its predecessors The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, and claimed Aladdin and Jasmine were \"pale and routine\". \n\nAwards\n\nAladdin also received many award nominations, mostly for its music. It won two Academy Awards, Best Music, Original Score and Best Music, Original Song for \"A Whole New World\" and receiving nominations for Best Song (\"Friend Like Me\"), Best Sound Editing (Mark A. Mangini), and Best Sound (Terry Porter, Mel Metcalfe, David J. Hudson and Doc Kane).  At the Golden Globes, Aladdin won Best Original Song (\"A Whole New World\") and Best Original Score, as well as a Special Achievement Award for Robin Williams, with a nomination for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.  Other awards included the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature,  a MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance to Robin Williams,  Saturn Awards for Best Fantasy Film, Performance by a Younger Actor to Scott Weinger and Supporting Actor to Robin Williams,  the Best Animated Feature by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association,  and four Grammy Awards, Best Soundtrack Album, and Song of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media for \"A Whole New World\". \n\nHome media \n\nThe film was first released in VHS on October 1, 1993, as part of the \"Walt Disney Classics\" line. In its first week of availability, Aladdin sold over 10.6 million copies,  and went on to sell over 25 million in total (a record only broken by the later release of The Lion King).  It entered moratorium on April 30, 1994. \n\nOn October 5, 2004, Aladdin was released on DVD, as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line. The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned-up animation, prepared for Aladdin's planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003,  and a second disc with bonus features. Accompanied by a $19 million marketing campaign, the DVD sold about 3 million units in its first month, but it was less than the number of copies, sold in that amount of time, by any other Platinum Edition released before it.  The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008, along with its sequels. \n\nAccording to an insert in the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition release case, Aladdin was going to be released on Blu-ray Disc as a Diamond Edition in Spring 2013.  Instead, Peter Pan was released on Blu-ray as a Diamond Edition on February 5, 2013 to celebrate its 60th anniversary.   A non-Diamond Edition Blu-ray was released in a few select European countries in March 2013. The Belgian edition (released without advertisements, commercials or any kind of fanfare) comes as a 1-disc version with its extras ported over from the Platinum Edition DVD). The same disc was released in the United Kingdom on April 14, 2013.  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on a Diamond Edition Blu-ray on October 13, 2015. The film was released on Digital HD on September 29, 2015.    Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Blu-ray Disc sales chart and debuted at number 2 at the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales behind the disaster film San Andreas. \n\nControversies\n\nOne of the verses of the opening song \"Arabian Nights\" was altered following protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC). The lyrics were changed in July 1993 from \"Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face,\" in the original release to \"Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense.\" The change first appeared on the 1993 video release.  The original lyric was intact on the initial CD soundtrack release, but the re-release uses the edited lyric. The rerecording has the original voice on all other lines and then a noticeably deeper voice says the edited line. The Broadway adaptation also uses the edited line.  Entertainment Weekly ranked Aladdin in a list of the most controversial films in history, due to this incident.  The ADC also complained about the portrayal of the lead characters Aladdin and Jasmine. They criticized the characters' Anglicized features and Anglo-American accents, in contrast to the other characters in the film, which are dark-skinned, have foreign accents and grotesque facial features, and appear villainous or greedy.\n\nProtests were also raised to another scene. When Aladdin is attacked by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony, Aladdin quietly says a line that some people reported hearing as \"Good teenagers, take off your clothes,\"  which they considered a subliminal reference to promiscuity. However, according to the director's commentary on the 2004 DVD, while Musker and Clements did admit Scott Weinger ad-libbed during the scene, they claimed \"we did not record that, we would not record that.\" and said the line was \"Good tiger, take off and go...\" and the word \"tiger\" is overlapped by Rajah's snarl.   After the word tiger, a second voice can be heard which has been suggested was accidentally grafted onto the soundtrack.  Because of the controversy, Disney removed the line on the DVD release. \n\nAnimation enthusiasts have noticed similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams' unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler (also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the Cobbler under Majestic Films International). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes and background designs, and the antagonist Zig-Zag's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar.   Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler was started much earlier in the 1960s, its production being mired in difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work.  The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the Cobbler being labeled a copy of Aladdin.\n\nLive-action prequel\n\nOn July 15, 2015, the studio started developing a live-action comedy adventure prequel called Genies that is being written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, while Tripp Vinson is on board to produce via his Vinson Films banner. The film is planned to lead for a live-action Aladdin movie.  On November 8, Disney revealed it had originally planned to use Robin Williams' unused lines from the 1991–92 recording sessions for the film, but his will prohibited the studio from using his likeness for twenty-five years after his death."

                "A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking.  Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. \n\nThe film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay in the boundaries of the film's budget. There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.\n\nResponsibility\n\nFilm directors create an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized/noticed.  Realizing this vision includes overseeing the artistic and technical elements of film production, as well as directing the shooting timetable and meeting deadlines.  This entails organizing the film crew in such a way as to achieve their vision of the film.   This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set.  Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew,  thus, excellent communication skills are a must. \n\nSince the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she or it or they also needs/need to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary.  Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film. The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as \"a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure\".   It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again.  Omnipresent are the boundaries of the films budget.  Additionally, the director may also have to ensure an intended age rating.   Theoretically the sole superior of a director is the studio that is financing the film,  however a poor working relationship between a film director and an actor could possibly result in the director being replaced if the actor is a major film star.  Even so, it is arguable that the director spends more time on a project than anyone else, considering that the director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one.  It has been said that \"20-hour days are not unusual\".\n\nUnder European Union law, the film director is considered the \"author\" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory. Auteur theory is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary \"auteur\" (the French word for \"author\"). In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.\n\nCareer pathways\n\nSome film directors started as screenwriters, film editors or actors.  Several American cinematographers have become directors, including Barry Sonnenfeld, originally the Coen brothers' DP; Jan de Bont, cinematographer on films as Die Hard and Basic Instinct, directed Speed and Twister. Recently Wally Pfister, cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's three Batman films made his directorial debut with Transcendence. Other film directors have attended a film school to \"get formal training and education in their craft\".   Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film.  This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, and reading scripts.  Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities.  Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production.  A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying.  Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment. The National Film School of Denmark has the student's final projects presented on national TV.  Some film schools retain the rights for their students' works.  Many directors successfully prepared for making feature films by working in television.  The German Film and Television Academy Berlin consequently cooperates with the Berlin/Brandenburg TV station RBB (Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting) and ARTE. \n\nA handful of top directors made from $13 million to $257 million in 2011, such as James Cameron and Steven Spielberg.

                "Jason Francesco Schwartzman (born June 26, 1980) is an American actor, screenwriter and musician. He is known for his frequent collaborations with Wes Anderson, such as Rushmore (1998), The Darjeeling Limited (2007), Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), Moonrise Kingdom (2012) and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). He also starred in other films, such as I Heart Huckabees (2004), Shopgirl (2005), Marie Antoinette (2006),  Funny People (2009),  Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) and Saving Mr. Banks (2013).\n\nIn addition to his film work, Schwartzman was the star of the HBO series Bored to Death (2009–2011), in which he played a writer who moonlights as an unlicensed private detective by advertising himself on Craigslist. He currently releases music through his solo project Coconut Records, and was formerly the drummer of rock band Phantom Planet.\n\nEarly life\n\nSchwartzman was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of actress Talia Shire (née Coppola) and the late producer Jack Schwartzman. Schwartzman's brother is actor and musician Robert Schwartzman, and his paternal half-siblings are Stephanie and John Schwartzman. Many other members of Schwartzman's family are involved in film: he is the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, cousin of Nicolas Cage, Sofia Coppola, Roman Coppola and Christopher Coppola, and grandson of Italia Coppola (née Pennino) and Carmine Coppola. His first cousin once removed, father Jack's first cousin, is Elliott B. Oppenheim, novelist and screenwriter, whose first novel was Kaleidoscope, a turbulent tale loosely based upon his final high school year in 1963-64.\n\nHis paternal grandparents were Polish Jewish immigrants, while his mother is Italian American and Catholic. Schwartzman has stated in interviews that he was raised without religion.  He attended Windward School in West Los Angeles. \n\nCareer\n\nActing\n\nSchwartzman's acting career began when he was 17 years old, when he starred in Wes Anderson's Rushmore in 1998. Prior to Rushmore, he had no acting experience. Shortly after in 2000, Jason had a guest role in the short-lived series Freaks and Geeks. In 2001, he starred in CQ, a film by his cousin Roman Coppola. In 2002, he starred in Slackers and in 2003 starred in Spun. In 2004, he starred in I Heart Huckabees, and Shopgirl in 2005. He also appeared in various television shows, such as Cracking Up. In 2006, he starred in Marie Antoinette under the direction of his cousin, Sofia Coppola, in which he appeared as King Louis XVI.\n\nSchwartzman made a cameo appearance as Ringo Starr in the biopic spoof Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. In 2009, he appeared as Mark, a C-list television star, in Funny People. He starred in the HBO show Bored to Death, in which he played a writer who moonlights as a private detective and puts himself up for hire on Craigslist. In 2009, he starred in The Marc Pease Experience. In 2010, he played Gideon Graves in the film Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, the movie adaptation of the comics by Bryan Lee O'Malley.\n\nIn 2011, Schwartzman made a cameo appearance as Vincent van Gogh in the Beastie Boys short film Fight For Your Right Revisited. In 2013, he made a cameo appearance as himself in an episode of the television show Key & Peele. In 2014 he played himself in the lead role of the Tim & Eric's Bedtime Stories episode The Endorsement.\n\nSchwartzman's most recent significant on-screen acting appearance was in the 2013 Disney film Saving Mr. Banks.  In it, he portrayed Disney songwriter Richard M. Sherman.  Schwartzman's brother, John, served as the film's cinematographer.\n\nMusic\n\nPrior to acting, Schwartzman was the drummer and a songwriter for the band Phantom Planet. Despite leaving the band, music remains one of his passions. He appeared in the music video for the rock remix of \"It's All About the Benjamins\" by Puff Daddy, and contributed to Ben Lee's 2005 album Awake Is the New Sleep. In 2007, he created the indie rock solo act Coconut Records. The first album, entitled Nighttiming, was produced by Michael Einziger and features a cover photo from Roman Coppola. The album was first released on iTunes on March 20, 2007. His second album, Davy, was released on iTunes on January 20, 2009. Schwartzman performed the musical score for Funny People and the theme song for Bored to Death.  He has also written tracks for Smallville and Slackers.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSchwartzman married long-time girlfriend Brady Cunningham at their home in the San Fernando Valley on July 11, 2009. Cunningham is an art and design director and co-owner of TENOVERSIX in Los Angeles.  Schwartzman describes himself as \"basically a vegan\" as he does not eat meat, dairy, or eggs.  He narrated a video, What to Eat: The Environmental Impacts of our Food, for Farm Sanctuary.  He has two daughters, Marlowe Rivers (born 2010) and Una (born 2014).  \n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nComposer\n\nAwards\n\nOn February 17, 2009, Schwartzman was named one of the \"Top 10 Most Stylish Men in America\" by GQ magazine."

                "Hinduism | Hinduism Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nEdit\nHindū is the Persian name for the Indus River , first encountered in the Old Persian word Hindu (həndu), corresponding to Vedic Sanskrit Sindhu, the Indus River . [10] The Rig Veda mentions the land of the Indo-Aryans as Sapta Sindhu (the land of the seven rivers in northwestern South Asia , one of them being the Indus). This corresponds to Hapta Həndu in the Avesta (Vendidad or Videvdad 1.18)—the sacred scripture of Zoroastrianism . The term was used for those who lived in the Indian subcontinent on or beyond the \"Sindhu\". [11] In Arabic , the term al-Hind (the Hind) also refers to 'the land of the people of modern day India'. [12]\nThe Persian term (Middle Persian Hindūk, New Persian Hindū) entered India with the Delhi Sultanate and appears in South Indian and Kashmiri texts from at least 1323 CE, [13] and increasingly so during British rule . Since the end of the 18th century the word has been used as an umbrella term for most of the religious, spiritual, and philosophical traditions of the sub-continent, usually excluding the religions of Sikhism , Buddhism , and Jainism as distinct.\nThe term Hinduism was introduced into the English language in the 19th century to denote the religious, philosophical, and cultural traditions native to India. [14]\nThe term Brahminism was also introduced in the 19th century, describing a limited subset of the traditions subsumed under \"Hinduism\", viz. the principles and practices of the Hindu Brahmin caste. The term is somewhat ambiguous and may either refer to Brahminical Hinduism , the current-day practices of Brahmins, or to Vedic Brahmanism , the historical religion from which medieval and modern Hinduism has evolved. [15]\nTypology\nMain article: Hindu denominations\nHinduism as we know it can be subdivided into a number of major currents. Of the historical division into six darshanas , only two schools, Vedanta and Yoga survive. The main divisions of Hinduism today are Vaishnavism , Shaivism , Smartism and Shaktism. [16]\nContemporary Hinduism is predominantly monotheistic, but Hindu tradition includes aspects that can be interpreted as panentheistic, pantheistic, polytheistic and even atheistic. Specifically, even though a single supreme God or divine essence is recognized, there are also numerous divine beings that are subordinate to it or are regarded as aspects or lower manifestations of it. [17] Other notable characteristics include a belief in reincarnation and karma, as well as in personal duty, or dharma .\nMcDaniel (2007) distinguishes six generic \"types\" of Hinduism, in an attempt to accommodate a variety of views on a rather complex subject: [18]\nFolk Hinduism , as based on local traditions and cults of local deities at a communal level and spanning back to prehistoric times or at least prior to written Vedas .\nYogic Hinduism, especially that based on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali .\n\"Dharmic\" Hinduism or \"daily morality\", based on the notion of Karma , and upon societal norms such as Hindu marriage customs .\nBhakti or devotionalism, especially as in Vaishnavism .\nDefinitions\nEdit\nHinduism does not have a \"unified system of belief encoded in declaration of faith or a creed \", [19] but is rather an umbrella term comprising the plurality of religious phenomena originating and based on the Vedic traditions . [20] [21] [22] [23]\nThe term Hindu in origin is a Persian word in use from the time of the Delhi Sultanate , referring to any tradition that is native to India as opposed to Islam . Hindu is used in the sense of \"Indian pagan\" in English from the 17th century, [24] but the notion of Hinduism as an identifiable religious tradition qualifying as one of the world religions emerged only during the 19th century.\nThe characteristic of comprehensive tolerance to differences in belief, and Hinduism's openness, makes it difficult to define as a religion according to traditional Western conceptions. [25] Although Hinduism is a clear practical concept to the majority of its adherents,[ citation needed ] many express a problem arriving at a definition of the term, mainly because of the wide range of traditions and ideas incorporated within it or covered by it. [19] While sometimes referred to as a religion, Hinduism is more often defined as a religious tradition. [26] It is therefore described as both the oldest of the world's religions, and the most diverse. [4] [27] [28] [29] Most Hindu traditions revere a body of religious or sacred literature , the Vedas , although there are exceptions. Some Hindu religious traditions regard particular rituals as essential for salvation, but a variety of views on this co-exist. Some Hindu philosophies postulate a theistic ontology of creation, of sustenance, and of destruction of the universe, yet some Hindus are atheists . Hinduism is sometimes characterized by the belief in reincarnation ( samsara ), determined by the law of karma , and the idea that salvation is freedom from this cycle of repeated birth and death. However, other religions of the region, such as Buddhism , Jainism and Sikhism , also believe in karma, outside the scope of Hinduism. [19] Hinduism is therefore viewed as the most complex of all of the living, historical world religions. [30] Despite its complexity, Hinduism is not only one of the numerically largest faiths, but is also the oldest living major tradition on earth, with roots reaching back into prehistory. [31]\nA definition of Hinduism, given by the first Vice President of India, who was also a prominent theologian, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , states that Hinduism is not \"just a faith\", but in itself is related to the union of reason and intuition . Radhakrishnan explicitly states that Hinduism cannot be defined, but is only to be experienced. [32] Similarly some academics suggest that Hinduism can be seen as a category with \"fuzzy edges\", rather than as a well-defined and rigid entity. Some forms of religious expression are central to Hinduism, while others are not as central but still remain within the category. Based on this, Ferro-Luzzi has developed a 'Prototype Theory approach' to the definition of Hinduism. [33]\nProblems with the single definition of what is actually meant by the term 'Hinduism' are often attributed to the fact that Hinduism does not have a single or common historical founder. Hinduism, or as some say 'Hinduisms,' does not have a single system of salvation and has different goals according to each sect or denomination. The forms of Vedic religion are seen not as an alternative to Hinduism, but as its earliest form, and there is little justification for the divisions found in much western scholarly writing between Vedism , Brahmanism , and Hinduism. [7] [34]\nA definition of Hinduism is further complicated by the frequent use of the term \" faith \" as a synonym for \"religion\". [19] Some academics [35] and many practitioners refer to Hinduism using a native definition, as Sanatana Dharma, a Sanskrit phrase meaning \"the eternal law \", or the \"eternal way\". [1] [36]\nBeliefs\nTemple carving at Hoysaleswara temple representing the Trimurti : Brahma , Shiva and Vishnu .\nHinduism refers to a religious mainstream which evolved organically and spread over a large territory marked by significant ethnic and cultural diversity. This mainstream evolved both by innovation from within, and by assimilation of  external traditions or cults into the Hindu fold. The result is an enormous variety of religious traditions, ranging from innumerable small, unsophisticated cults to major religious movements with millions of adherents spread over the entire subcontinent. The identification of Hinduism  as an independent religion separate from Buddhism or Jainism consequently hinges on the affirmation of its adherents that it is such. [37]\nProminent themes in Hindu beliefs include (but are not restricted to), Dharma (ethics/duties), Samsāra (The continuing cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth), Karma (action and subsequent reaction), Moksha (liberation from samsara), and the various Yogas (paths or practices). [38]\nConcept of God\nMain article: God in Hinduism\nHinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning monotheism , polytheism , [39] panentheism , pantheism , monism , and atheism , and its concept of God is complex and depends upon each particular tradition and philosophy. It is sometimes referred to as henotheistic (i.e., involving devotion to a single god while accepting the existence of others), but any such term is an overgeneralization. [40]\nMost Hindus believe that the spirit or soul — the true \"self\" of every person, called the ātman — is eternal. [41] According to the monistic/pantheistic theologies of Hinduism (such as Advaita Vedanta school), this Atman is ultimately indistinct from Brahman , the supreme spirit. Hence, these schools are called non-dualist . [42] The goal of life, according to the Advaita school, is to realize that one's ātman is identical to Brahman, the supreme soul. [43] The Upanishads state that whoever becomes fully aware of the ātman as the innermost core of one's own self realizes an identity with Brahman and thereby reaches moksha (liberation or freedom). [41] [44]\nDualistic schools (see Dvaita and Bhakti ) understand Brahman as a Supreme Being who possesses personality, and they worship him or her thus, as Vishnu , Brahma , Shiva , or Shakti , depending upon the sect. The ātman is dependent on God, while moksha depends on love towards God and on God's grace. [45] When God is viewed as the supreme personal being (rather than as the infinite principle), God is called Ishvara (\"The Lord\"), [46] Bhagavan (\"The Auspicious One\" [46] ) or Parameshwara (\"The Supreme Lord\" [46] ). [42] However interpretations of Ishvara vary, ranging from non-belief in Ishvara by followers of Mimamsakas , to identifying Brahman and Ishvara as one, as in Advaita. [42] In the majority of traditions of Vaishnavism he is Vishnu, God, and the text of Vaishnava scriptures identify this Being as Krishna , sometimes referred to as svayam bhagavan . There are also schools like the Samkhya which have atheistic leanings. [47]\nDevas and avatars\nFile:Krishna holding flute.jpg\nThe Hindu scriptures refer to celestial entities called Devas (or devī in feminine form; devatā used synonymously for Deva in Hindi), \"the shining ones\", which may be translated into English as \"gods\" or \"heavenly beings\". [48] The devas are an integral part of Hindu culture and are depicted in art , architecture and through icons , and mythological stories about them are related in the scriptures, particularly in Indian epic poetry and the Puranas . They are, however, often distinguished from Ishvara , a supreme personal god, with many Hindus worshiping Ishvara in one of its particular manifestations (ostensibly separate deities) as their iṣṭa devatā , or chosen ideal. [49] [50] The choice is a matter of individual preference, [51] and of regional and family traditions. [51]\nHindu epics and the Puranas relate several episodes of the descent of God to Earth in corporeal form to restore dharma to society and to guide humans to moksha. Such an incarnation is called an avatar . The most prominent avatars are of Vishnu and include Rama (the protagonist in Ramayana ) and Krishna (a central figure in the epic Mahabharata ).\nKarma and samsara\nMain article: Karma in Hinduism\nKarma translates literally as action, work, or deed, [52] and can be described as the \"moral law of cause and effect\". [53] According to the Upanishads an individual, known as the jiva-atma, develops sanskaras (impressions) from actions, whether physical or mental. The linga sharira, a body more subtle than the physical one but less subtle than the soul, retains impressions, carrying them over into the next life, establishing a unique trajectory for the individual. [54] Thus, the concept of a universal, neutral, and never-failing karma intrinsically relates to reincarnation as well as to one's personality, characteristics, and family. Karma binds together the notions of free will and destiny .\nThis cycle of action, reaction, birth, death and rebirth is a continuum called samsara . The notion of reincarnation and karma is a strong premise in Hindu thought. The Bhagavad Gita states that:\n“\nAs a person puts on new clothes and discards old and torn clothes,\nsimilarly an embodied soul enters new material bodies, leaving the old bodies.(B.G. 2:22) [55]\n”\nSamsara provides ephemeral pleasures, which lead people to desire rebirth so as to enjoy the pleasures of a perishable body. However, escaping the world of samsara through moksha is believed to ensure lasting happiness and peace. [56] [57] It is thought that after several reincarnations, an atman eventually seeks unity with the cosmic spirit (Brahman/Paramatman).\nThe ultimate goal of life, referred to as moksha, nirvana or samadhi , is understood in several different ways: as the realization of one's union with God; as the realization of one's eternal relationship with God; realization of the unity of all existence; perfect unselfishness and knowledge of the Self; as the attainment of perfect mental peace; and as detachment from worldly desires. Such realization liberates one from samsara and ends the cycle of rebirth. [58] [59]\nThe exact conceptualization of moksha differs among the various Hindu schools of thought. For example, Advaita Vedanta holds that after attaining moksha an atman no longer identifies itself with an individual but as identical with Brahman in all respects. The followers of Dvaita (dualistic) schools identify themselves as part of Brahman, and after attaining moksha expect to spend eternity in a loka (heaven), [60] in the company of their chosen form of Ishvara. Thus, it is said that the followers of dvaita wish to \"taste sugar\", while the followers of Advaita wish to \"become sugar\". [61]\nObjectives of human life\nMain article: Purusharthas\nClassical Hindu thought accepts the following objectives of human life, known as the puruṣārthas: dharma \"righteousness, ethikos ;\" artha \"livelihood, wealth;\" kāma \"sensual pleasure;\" mokṣa \"liberation, freedom (from samsara )\". [62] [63]\nYoga\nFile:Sivakempfort.jpg\nIn whatever way a Hindu defines the goal of life, there are several methods (yogas) that sages have taught for reaching that goal. Texts dedicated to Yoga include the Bhagavad Gita, the Yoga Sutras , the Hatha Yoga Pradipika , and, as their philosophical and historical basis, the Upanishads. Paths that one can follow to achieve the spiritual goal of life (moksha, samadhi or nirvana ) include:\nBhakti Yoga (the path of love and devotion)\nKarma Yoga (the path of right action)\nJñāna Yoga (the path of wisdom) [64]\nAn individual may prefer one or some yogas over others, according to his or her inclination and understanding. Some devotional schools teach that bhakti is the only practical path to achieve spiritual perfection for most people, based on their belief that the world is currently in the Kali Yuga (one of four epochs which are part of the Yuga cycle). [65] Practice of one yoga does not exclude others. Many schools believe that the different yogas naturally blend into and aid other yogas. For example, the practice of jnana yoga, is thought to inevitably lead to pure love (the goal of bhakti yoga), and vice versa. [66] Someone practicing deep meditation (such as in raja yoga) must embody the core principles of karma yoga, jnana yoga and bhakti yoga, whether directly or indirectly. [64] [67]\nPractices\nFile:Ganesh mimarjanam 2 EDITED.jpg\nHindu practices generally involve seeking awareness of God and sometimes also seeking blessings from Devas. Therefore, Hinduism has developed numerous practices meant to help one think of divinity in the midst of everyday life. Hindus can engage in pūjā (worship or veneration), [46] either at home or at a temple. At home, Hindus often create a shrine with icons dedicated to their   chosen form(s) of God. Temples are usually dedicated to a primary deity along with associated subordinate deities though some commemorate multiple deities. Visiting temples is not obligatory, [68] and many visit temples only during religious festivals. Hindus perform their worship through icons ( murtis ). The icon serves as a tangible link between the worshiper and God. [69] The image is often considered a manifestation of God, since God is immanent. The Padma Purana states that the mūrti is not to be thought of as mere stone or wood but as a manifest form of the Divinity. [70] A few Hindu sects, such as the Ārya Samāj , do not believe in worshiping God through icons.\nHinduism has a developed system of symbolism and iconography to represent the sacred in art, architecture, literature and worship. These symbols gain their meaning from the scriptures, mythology, or cultural traditions. The syllable Om (which represents the Parabrahman) and the Swastika sign (which symbolizes auspiciousness) have grown to represent Hinduism itself, while other markings such as tilaka identify a follower of the faith. Hinduism associates many symbols, which include the lotus, chakra and veena , with particular deities.\nMantras are invocations, praise and prayers that through their meaning, sound, and chanting style help a devotee focus the mind on holy thoughts or express devotion to God/the deities. Many devotees perform morning ablutions at the bank of a sacred river while chanting the Gayatri Mantra or Mahamrityunjaya mantras. [ citation needed ] The epic Mahabharata extols Japa (ritualistic chanting) as the greatest duty in the Kali Yuga (what Hindus believe to be the current age). [ citation needed ] Many adopt Japa as their primary spiritual practice. [ citation needed ]\nRituals\nFile:HinduWeddingItems.jpg\nThe vast majority of Hindus engage in religious rituals on a daily basis. [71] Most Hindus observe religious rituals at home. [72] but observation of rituals greatly vary among regions, villages, and individuals. Devout Hindus perform daily chores such as worshiping at dawn after bathing (usually at a family shrine, and typically includes lighting a lamp and offering foodstuffs before the images of deities), recitation from religious scripts, singing devotional hymns , meditation , chanting mantras, reciting scriptures etc. [72] A notable feature in religious ritual is the division between purity and pollution. Religious acts presuppose some degree of impurity or defilement for the practitioner, which must be overcome or neutralised before or during ritual procedures. Purification, usually with water, is thus a typical feature of most religious action. [72] Other characteristics include a belief in the efficacy of sacrifice and concept of merit, gained through the performance of charity or good works, that will accumulate over time and reduce sufferings in the next world. [72] Vedic rites of fire-oblation ( yajna ) are now only occasional practices, although they are highly revered in theory. In Hindu wedding and burial ceremonies, however, the yajña and chanting of Vedic mantras are still the norm. [73] The rituals, upacharas , change with time. For instance, in the past few hundred years some rituals, such as sacred dance and music offerings in the standard Sodasa Upacharas set prescribed by the Agama Shastra , were replaced by the offerings of rice and sweets.\nOccasions like birth, marriage, and death involve what are often elaborate sets of religious customs. In Hinduism, life-cycle rituals include Annaprashan (a baby's first intake of solid food), Upanayanam (\"sacred thread ceremony\" undergone by upper-caste children at their initiation into formal education) and Śrāddha (ritual of treating people to feasts in the name of the deceased). [74] [75] For most people in India, the betrothal of the young couple and the exact date and time of the wedding are matters decided by the parents in consultation with astrologers. [74] On death, cremation is considered obligatory for all except sanyasis , hijra , and children under five. [76] Cremation is typically performed by wrapping the corpse in cloth and burning it on a pyre .\nPilgrimage and festivals\nFile:Diwali Diya.jpg\nPilgrimage is not mandatory in Hinduism, though many adherents undertake them [77] Hindus recognise several Indian holy cities, including Allahabad , Haridwar , Varanasi , and Vrindavan . Notable temple cities include Puri , which hosts a major Vaishnava Jagannath temple and Rath Yatra celebration; Tirumala - Tirupati , home to the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple ; and Katra , home to the Vaishno Devi temple. The four holy sites Puri , Rameswaram , Dwarka , and Badrinath (or alternatively the Himalayan towns of Badrinath , Kedarnath , Gangotri , and Yamunotri ) compose the Char Dham (four abodes) pilgrimage circuit. The Kumbh Mela (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated among Allahabad, Haridwar, Nashik , and Ujjain . Another important set of pilgrimages are the Shakti Peethas , where the Mother Goddess is worshipped, the two principal ones being Kalighat and Kamakhya .\nHinduism has many festivals throughout the year. The Hindu calendar usually prescribe their dates. The festivals typically celebrate events from Hindu mythology, often coinciding with seasonal changes. There are festivals which are primarily celebrated by specific sects or in certain regions of the Indian subcontinent . Some widely observed Hindu festivals are Maha Shivaratri , Holi , Ram Navami , Krishna Janmastami , Ganesh Chaturthi , Dussera , Durga Puja and Diwali .\nScriptures\nFile:Rigveda MS2097.jpg\nHinduism is based on \"the accumulated treasury of spiritual laws discovered by different persons in different times\". [78] [79] The scriptures were transmitted orally in verse form to aid memorization, for many centuries before they were written down. [80] Over many centuries, sages refined the teachings and expanded the canon. In post-Vedic and current Hindu belief, most Hindu scriptures are not typically interpreted literally. More importance is attached to the ethics and metaphorical meanings derived from them. [81] Most sacred texts are in Sanskrit . The texts are classified into two classes: Shruti and Smriti.\nShruti\nEdit\nShruti (lit: that which is heard) [82] primarily refers to the Vedas, which form the earliest record of the Hindu scriptures. While many Hindus revere the Vedas as eternal truths revealed to ancient sages ( Ṛṣis ), [79] some devotees do not associate the creation of the Vedas with a god or person. They are thought of as the laws of the spiritual world, which would still exist even if they were not revealed to the sages. [78] [83] [84] Hindus believe that because the spiritual truths of the Vedas are eternal, they continue to be expressed in new ways. [85]\nThere are four Vedas (called Ṛg-, Sāma-, Yajus- and Atharva-). The Rigveda is the first and most important Veda. [86] Each Veda is divided into four parts: the primary one, the Veda proper, being the Saṃhitā , which contains sacred mantras. The other three parts form a three-tier ensemble of commentaries, usually in prose and are believed to be slightly later in age than the Saṃhitā. These are: the Brāhmaṇas , Āraṇyakas , and the Upanishads . The first two parts were subsequently called the Karmakāṇḍa (ritualistic portion), while the last two form the Jñānakāṇḍa (knowledge portion). [87] While the Vedas focus on rituals, the Upanishads focus on spiritual insight and philosophical teachings, and discuss Brahman and reincarnation . [81] [88] [89]\nSmritis\nFile:Naradiyamahapuranam.jpg\nHindu texts other than the Shrutis are collectively called the Smritis (memory).  The most notable of the smritis are the epics , which consist of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa . The Bhagavad Gītā is an integral part of the Mahabharata and one of the most popular sacred texts of Hinduism. It contains philosophical teachings from Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu, told to the prince Arjuna on the eve of a great war. The Bhagavad Gītā, spoken by Krishna , is described as the essence of the Vedas. [90] However Gita, sometimes called Gitopanishad, is more often placed in the Shruti , category, being Upanishadic in content. [91] The Smritis also include the Purāṇas , which illustrate Hindu ideas through vivid narratives. There are texts with a sectarian nature such as Devī Mahātmya , the Tantras , the Yoga Sutras , Tirumantiram , Shiva Sutras and the Hindu Āgamas . A more controversial text, the Manusmriti , is a prescriptive lawbook which epitomizes the societal codes of the caste system .[ citation needed ]\nHistory\nFile:Kailash Tibet.jpg\nThe earliest evidence for prehistoric religion in India date back to the late Neolithic in the early Harappan period (5500–2600 BCE). [81] [92] The beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era (1500–500 BCE) are called the \" historical Vedic religion \". Modern Hinduism grew out of the Vedas, the oldest of which is the Rigveda , dated to 1700–1100 BCE. [93] The Vedas center on worship of deities such as Indra , Varuna and Agni , and on the Soma ritual. They performed fire-sacrifices, called yajña , and chanted Vedic mantras but did not build temples or icons . [ citation needed ] The oldest Vedic traditions exhibit strong similarities to Zoroastrianism and other Indo-European religions. [94]\nThe major Sanskrit epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata , were compiled over a protracted period during the late centuries BCE and the early centuries CE. They  contain mythological stories about the rulers and wars of ancient India, and are interspersed with religious and philosophical treatises. The later Puranas recount tales about devas and devis , their interactions with humans and their battles against demons .\nThree major movements underpinned the naissance of a new epoch of Hindu thought: the advent and spread of Upanishadic, Jaina , and Buddhist philosophico-religious thought throughout the broader Indian landmass. [95] Mahavira (24th Tirthankar of Jains) and Buddha (founder of Buddhism ) taught that to achieve moksha or nirvana, one did not have to accept the authority of the Vedas or the caste system. Buddha went a step further and claimed that the existence of a Self/soul or God was unnecessary. [96] Buddhism peaked during the reign of Asoka the Great of the Mauryan Empire , who unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. After 200 CE several schools of thought were formally codified in Indian philosophy , including Samkhya , Yoga , Nyaya , Vaisheshika , Purva-Mimamsa and Vedanta . [97] Charvaka , the founder of an atheistic materialist school, came to the fore in North India in the sixth century BCE. [98] Between 400 BCE and 1000 CE Hinduism expanded at the expense of Buddhism. [99]\nSanskritic culture went into decline after the end of the Gupta period . The early medieval Puranas helped establish a religious mainstream among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation . The tenets of Brahmanic Hinduism and of the Dharmashastras underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of a mainstream \"Hinduism\" that overshadowed all earlier traditions. [100]\nThough Islam came to India in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders and the conquest of Sindh, it started to become a major religion during the later Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent . [98] During this period Buddhism declined rapidly and many Hindus converted to Islam . Numerous Muslim rulers such as Aurangzeb destroyed Hindu temples and persecuted non-Muslims ; however some, such as Akbar , were more tolerant. Hinduism underwent profound changes, in large part due to the influence of the prominent teachers Ramanuja , Madhva , and Chaitanya . [98] Followers of the Bhakti movement moved away from the abstract concept of Brahman , which the philosopher Adi Shankara consolidated a few centuries before, with emotional, passionate devotion towards the more accessible avatars , especially Krishna and Rama. [101]\nFile:Akshardham Delhi .jpg\nIndology as an academic discipline of studying Indian culture from a European perspective was established in the 19th century, led by scholars such as Max Müller and John Woodroffe . They brought Vedic , Puranic and Tantric literature and philosophy to Europe and the United States . At the same time, societies such as the Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society attempted to reconcile and fuse Abrahamic and Dharmic philosophies, endeavouring to institute societal reform. This period saw the emergence of movements which, while highly innovative, were rooted in indigenous tradition. They were based on the personalities and teachings of individuals, as with Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi . Prominent Hindu philosophers, including Aurobindo and Prabhupada (founder of ISKCON ), translated, reformulated and presented Hinduism's foundational texts for contemporary audiences in new iterations, attracting followers and attention in India and abroad. Others such as Vivekananda , Paramahansa Yogananda , B.K.S. Iyengar and Swami Rama have also been instrumental in raising the profiles of Yoga and Vedanta in the West. Today modern movements, such as ISKCON and the Swaminarayan Faith , attract a large amount of followers across the world. [102]\nSociety\nFile:Tirumala temple.JPG\nHinduism has no central doctrinal authority and many practising Hindus do not claim to belong to any particular denomination. [103] However, academics categorize contemporary Hinduism into four major denominations: Vaishnavism , Shaivism , Shaktism and Smartism . The denominations differ primarily in the god worshipped as the Supreme One and in the traditions that accompany worship of that god.\nVaishnavas worship Vishnu as the supreme God; Shaivites worship Shiva as the supreme; Shaktas worship Shakti (power) personified through a female divinity or Mother Goddess , Devi ; while Smartas believe in the essential oneness of five ( panchadeva ) or six ( Shanmata , as Tamil Hindus add Skanda ) [104] deities as personifications of the Supreme.\nThe Western conception of what Hinduism is has been defined by the Smarta view; many Hindus, who may not understand or follow Advaita philosophy, in contemporary Hinduism, invariably follow the Shanmata belief worshiping many forms of God. One commentator, noting the influence of the Smarta tradition, remarked that although many Hindus may not strictly identify themselves as Smartas but, by adhering to Advaita Vedanta as a foundation for non-sectarianism, are indirect followers. [105]\nOther denominations like Ganapatya (the cult of Ganesha ) and Saura ( Sun worship) are not so widespread.\nThere are movements that are not easily placed in any of the above categories, such as Swami Dayananda Saraswati 's Arya Samaj , which rejects image worship and veneration of multiple deities. It focuses on the Vedas and the Vedic fire sacrifices ( yajña ).\nThe Tantric traditions have various sects, as Banerji observes:\n“\nTantras are ... also divided as āstika or Vedic and nāstika or non-Vedic. In accordance with the predominance of the deity the āstika works are again divided as Śākta (Shakta), Śaiva (Shaiva), Saura, Gāṇapatya and Vaiṣṇava (Vaishnava). [106]\n”\nAs in every religion, some view their own denomination as superior to others. However, many Hindus consider other denominations to be legitimate alternatives to their own. [ citation needed ] Heresy is therefore generally not an issue for Hindus. [107]\nAshramas\nMain article: Ashrama\nTraditionally the life of a Hindu is divided into four Āshramas (phases or stages; unrelated meanings include monastery). The first part of one's life, Brahmacharya , the stage as a student, is spent in celibate, controlled, sober and pure contemplation under the guidance of a Guru , building up the mind for spiritual knowledge. Grihastha is the householder's stage, in which one marries and satisfies kāma and artha in one's married and professional life respectively (see the goals of life ). The moral obligations of a Hindu householder include supporting one's parents, children, guests and holy figures. Vānaprastha , the retirement stage, is gradual detachment from the material world. This may involve giving over duties to one's children, spending more time in religious practices and embarking on holy pilgrimages. Finally, in Sannyāsa , the stage of asceticism , one renounces all worldly attachments to secludedly find the Divine through detachment from worldly life and peacefully shed the body for Moksha . [108]\nMonasticism\nMain article: Sannyasa\nSome Hindus choose to live a monastic life (Sannyāsa) in pursuit of liberation or another form of spiritual perfection. Monastics commit themselves to a life of simplicity, celibacy , detachment from worldly pursuits, and the contemplation of God. [109] A Hindu monk is called a sanyāsī, sādhu , or swāmi . A female renunciate is called a sanyāsini. Renunciates receive high respect in Hindu society because their outward renunciation of selfishness and worldliness serves as an inspiration to householders who strive for mental renunciation. Some monastics live in monasteries, while others wander from place to place, trusting in God alone to provide for their needs. [110] It is considered a highly meritorious act for a householder to provide sādhus with food or other necessaries. Sādhus strive to treat all with respect and compassion, whether a person may be poor or rich, good or wicked, and to be indifferent to praise, blame, pleasure, and pain. [109]\nVarnas\nHindu society has traditionally been categorized into four classes, called Varnas (Sanskrit: \"colour, form, appearance\"): [46]\nthe Brahmins : teachers and priests;\nthe Kshatriyas : warriors, nobles, and kings;\nthe Vaishyas : farmers, merchants, and businessmen; and\nthe Shudras : servants and labourers.\nHindus and scholars debate whether the so-called caste system is an integral part of Hinduism sanctioned by the scriptures or an outdated social custom. [111] Among the scriptures, the Varna system is mentioned sparingly and descriptively (i.e., not prescriptive ); apart from a single mention in the late Rigvedic Purusha sukta , the rigid division into varnas appears to be post-Vedic, appearing in classical texts from the Maurya period . The Bhagavad Gītā ( 4.13 ) states that the four varṇa divisions are created by God, and the Manusmṛiti categorizes the different castes. [112] However, at the same time, the Gītā says that one's varṇa is to be understood from one's personal qualities and one's work, not one's birth. [113] Some mobility and flexibility within the varnas challenge allegations of social discrimination in the caste system, as has been pointed out by several sociologists. [114] [115]\nMany social reformers, including Mahatma Gandhi and B. R. Ambedkar , criticized caste discrimination. [116] The religious teacher Sri Ramakrishna (1836–1886) taught that\n“\n\"Lovers of God do not belong to any caste . . . . A brahmin without this love is no longer a brahmin. And a pariah with the love of God is no longer a pariah. Through bhakti (devotion to God) an untouchable becomes pure and elevated.\" [117]\n”\nMain article: Ahimsa\nHindus advocate the practice of ahiṃsā (non-violence) and respect for all life because divinity is believed to permeate all beings, including plants and non-human animals. [118] The term ahiṃsā appears in the Upanishads , [119] the epic Mahabharata [120] and Ahiṃsā is the first of the five Yamas (vows of self-restraint) in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras . [121]\nIn accordance with ahiṃsā, many Hindus embrace vegetarianism to respect higher forms of life. Vegetarianism is propagated by the Yajur Veda and it is recommended for a satvic (purifying) lifestyle. [122] Estimates of the number of lacto vegetarians in India (includes adherents of all religions) vary between 20% and 42%. [123] The food habits vary with the community and region, for example some castes having fewer vegetarians and coastal populations relying on seafood. [124] [125] Some Hindus avoid onion and garlic , which are regarded as rajasic foods. [126] Some avoid meat only on specific holy days.\nObservant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from beef . The cow in Hindu society is traditionally identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure, [127] and Hindu society honors the cow as a symbol of unselfish giving. [128]\nCow-slaughter is legally banned in almost all states of India. [129] See further discussion at Cattle in Religion and Food taboo .\nConversion\nSee also: List of converts to Hinduism\nConcepts of conversion , evangelization , and proselytization in practice have never played a significant role in the religion, though acceptance of willing converts is becoming more common. Early in its history, in the absence of other competing religions, Hindus considered everyone they came across as Hindus and expected everyone they met to be Hindus. [130] [131]\nHindus today continue to be influenced by historical ideas of acceptability of conversion. Hence, many Hindus continue to believe that Hinduism is an identity that can only be had from birth, while many others continue to believe that anyone who follows Hindu beliefs and practices is a Hindu, and many believe in some form of both theories. However, as a reaction to perceived and actual threat of evangelization, prozelyzation, and conversion activities of other major religions most modern Hindus are opposed to the idea of conversion from (any) one religion to (any) other per se. [132]\nHindus in Western countries generally accept and welcome willing converts, whereas in India acceptance of willing converts is becoming more common. With the rise of Hindu revivalist movements, reconversions to Hinduism have also risen. [133] Reconversions are well accepted since conversion out of Hinduism is not recognized. [134] Conversion into Hinduism through marriage is well accepted and often expected to enable the non-Hindu partner to fully participate in their spiritual, religious, and cultural roles within the larger Hindu family and society. [ citation needed ]\nThere is no formal process for converting to Hinduism, although in many traditions a ritual called dīkshā (\"initiation\") marks the beginning of spiritual life. A ritual called shuddhi (\"purification\") sometimes marks the return to spiritual life after reconversion. Most Hindu sects do not seek converts, [135] [136] [137] [138] as they believe that the goals of spiritual life can be attained through any religion, as long as it is practiced sincerely. [135] [139] However, some Hindu sects and affiliates such as Arya Samaj , Saiva Siddhanta Church , BAPS , and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness accept those who have a desire to follow Hinduism.\nIn general, Hindu view of religious freedom is not based on the freedom to proselytize, but the right to retain one's religion and not be subject to proselytization. Hindu leaders are advocating for changing the existing formulation of the freedom of religion clause in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights since it favors religions which proselytize.

Beside\nIsrael\nstands the mysterious India, the great foundry of religious consciousness in the history of civilization. The source of this contribution, we suspect, is very ancient, already so by the time of the emergence of Buddhism, which is a kind of reform movement, and baton transfer from the Jain tradition.\nThe Primordial Tradition It is incorrect to see the source of Indian religion in the Axial Age. The primordial ï¿½Shaivismï¿½, the source of yoga/tantra, probably appears in the Neolithic period. The question of Indo-European invasion/migration has muddled the whole history with a confusing ï¿½somethingï¿½ called ï¿½Hinduismï¿½ and its Vedic interpolation. Note the further comic irony that the (spurious, no doubt) periodization of the ï¿½dread Kali Yugaï¿½ puts the classic era of the Axial period, Hinduism included, in the rubric of decline!\nShiva and Dionysus Is much of what we see in the classical era a set of remnants from an earlier period of Neolithic religion, spread across an entire oikoumene from India to Europe? The thesis is plausible in the abstract, while the details remain controversial. [i]\nBoth\nand\nIndia\nare considered ï¿½spiritual culturesï¿½, but this prejudicial notion does not correspond to the real facts, and if we observe carefully, and then consider first\nChina, and then Greece, we will see a spectrum, not a dualistic division. In fact the Axial period of\nIndia\nshows a remarkable resemblance to the Greek and Judaic cases combined, a system of city states suddenly crystallizing a tradition in a spectrum of philosophers and sages. The emergence of Hinduism is deceptive, for it is a hybrid created between the more ancient, probably Dravidian, tradition, and the peoples of the Aryan invasion. [ii]\nThe history of India, and of its religions, can be very confusing in this regard, due in part to the cultural contradictions of its different traditions. The question of the Aryan invasion has produced a set of attempts to deny the reality of that process whereby an Indo-European migration resulted in a hybrid cultural formation of the Aryan and Dravidian elements. The grafting of the Aryan rule of caste on a religious tradition in which it was absent creates the distorted phenomenon of Brahminism, and a subtle exploitative field of guruism.\nStream and Sequence: Buddhism The case of Buddhism in\nIndia\nis spectacular, and a classic case of our stream and sequence effect. The streams of primordial Shaivism and Jainism are sifted and refined to produce a world religion ready to ship outwards in parallel to Occidental monotheism. The streamlined Buddhism carries none of the baggage that will chaotify so-called Hinduism.\nDates of Buddha There is a considerable effort to revise the dates of the Buddha. This is quite suspicious, although a later date would in some ways conform better to our thesis: the seminal era of Axial innovations is followed (as with Ezra and Nehemiah in Israel) by a codification of a world religion.\nPost-Axial Shaivite Revival The stream and sequence argument can help to sort out post-Axial Indian history, for the resurfacing of the primordial Shaivism generates a series of indirect effects that can be confusing, for example, the sudden odd appearance of ï¿½tantraï¿½ in a Buddhist context. [iii]\nMany commentators, and critics of the Aryan invasion hypothesis, have pointed to the great antiquity of Indian religion. But this is not an argument against the relatively late appearance of the Indo-Europeans, merely a suggestion that earlier, perhaps the Dravidian, cultures were the primordial vehicle of the ancient from which the core of Indian religion sprang. Once seen in this light, many of the problems that distract us from a correct picture of Indian history fall away. Beside this lies the tradition of Jainism, which seems to come to an end in the Axial Age, even as it spawns a successor tradition in the emergence of Buddhism. We must note the apt application of our ï¿½stream and sequenceï¿½ argument, and the way in which, through all the confusions, the Axial period seems to resolve the stream by creating an element of Indian religion for the sequence, by creating a global vehicle, Buddhism. [iv]\nThus\nIndia\n, if we care to set aside our western viewpoint, shows us something preserved from great antiquity, and it would seem that we have glimpses of the birth of the great religions in the Neolithic. In any case, the primordial ï¿½religionï¿½ of Shaivism, from which springs the lore of yoga and tantra, lurks behind the later results that we see in Hindusim and Buddhism. Before the emergence of monotheism, the impulse of the sacred was preparing to leap beyond the notions of the transcendental or the conceptions of divinity to base religion on inquiry into consciousness.\nThe tendency of Westerners to see a single linear track of civilization, the ï¿½rise of the Westï¿½, and forgets that the modern transition in its sudden unbalancing westward of the eonic sequence, is a very recent phenomenon in a once relatively backward zone of world civilization. It is almost impossible to sort out the emergence of, and relationships between, the forms of the classic yogas as they appear already before the Aryan entry into India, and reappear blended with Vedism and its issues of sacrifice, polytheism, and caste in the later Hinduism. The sudden eruption of Jainism and Buddhism, in period, is a clue to the later loss of the correct picture.\nThe earliest period of Indian history has already seen the civilization of the\nIndus\ncome and go as the entry of the Vedic Aryans finds their religious culture to be typical of the proto-Iranian, and proto-Germanic spiritual cultures and the elements of the divisions into castes that are still visible in some aspects of Greek and Roman culture. The mystery is where the elements of the great yogas come from if not from the Vedic culture that shows a completely different character. Already these elements are visible in the famous cylinder seal of the meditating yogi found in the\nIndus\narchaeological nexus. A considerable revisionist literature is now challenging the standard version of the Aryan invasion. But the picture is still unclear.\nUpanishad It is almost impossible to grasp the complexity of Indian religious history without seeing the context of the eonic effect, or the Axial Age. The sudden appearance of the Upanishads in the exact time-frame of the transition, morphing out of quite different elements, is one of the most remarkable emergent processes of the transition. The transformation does its job, even if the result is misleading, i.e. it seems the outcome of some kind of Aryan Vedism. But in fact it is a primordial tradition picked up in the field of the eonic transition.\nJainism It is Jainism that is carrying the great tradition of yoga from an earlier age, and these elements flow into the timely recreation of that tradition in Buddhism, and then in so-called Hinduism. The figure of Parshvadeva, a Jain teerthankar in the eighth century BCE suggests that a seminal transition now almost invisible to us was the decisive action in the gestation of the later Hindu and Buddhist outcomes. [v]\nFor our account, we can remain neutral, but the eonic context clarifies at once the way in which Buddhism suddenly appears in still another example of the ï¿½relative transformï¿½ effect applied to an incoming stream, taking a birdï¿½s eye view over millennia. In essence, and in exactly the same time frame, we see localized cultural elements turn into a global religion rendered independent of cultural context. By the time of Ashoka we see the same passage to ï¿½oikoumene integratorï¿½ in the early mixed forms that are characteristic of the\nPersian Empire\n. This eonic isomorphism with the Judaic case is entirely remarkable, and explains why Buddhism seems to stand out from its Hindu background. The great Hindu comeback against the Axial Buddhist ï¿½revolutionï¿½ produces the world of the misleading Bhagavad Gita.\nThe emergence of Buddhism in the standard accounts is just after our divide, ca. -600. Some scholars now put this date forward, which would be appropriate also, since we can see that Buddhism is appearing about the time of the Ezra era in Israel. Our actual transitional era is almost lost to us, in detail, and produces the sources of the remarkable Samkhya, and a great deal more in a great flowering. All this is almost perfectly matched to our eonic model, which should allow us to stand back and put this era in perspective. Please note the appearance of another classic example of the relative transform (of a religion) that we have seen already in the steps of the eonic sequence. That is, the stream of Indian history already contains what the Axial Age will amplify and turn into the exteriorizing world religion of Buddhism. We should note, however, that ï¿½Hinduismï¿½ in the post-Axial period is essentially still another relative transform of itself, and thus on its own terms an ï¿½eonic emergentï¿½.\nThe interruption of the rationalistic Buddhism  between Vedism and the later Hinduism is the giveaway, however indirect, of the redirected stream so evident in the synchronous world of\nIsrael\nand Greece. [vi]\nAs Prem Nath Bazaz notes in The Role of the Bhagavad Gita in Indian History :\nThe seventh and sixth centuries B.C. witnessed in India, as in Greece, an intellectual ferment. Dissatisfaction with the Vedic natural religion gave rise to speculations about the origin of the universe and things contained in itï¿½There arose early in the sixth century B.C. an order of paribrajakas (literally ï¿½wanderersï¿½) who were intellectuals devoted to search after truthï¿½The movement of paribrajakas spread far and wide in Northern India; they were accepted as harbingers of a new ageï¿½ [vii]            \nThe views expressed in this flawed and highly charged but useful book suggest the fact that Buddha was not only a religious founder, but a social revolutionary, a view with a bit of its own myth perhaps, but the account gives an apt descant on the Axial period compared with the later destruction of Buddhist India. It is time for some fact checks on all accounts until the record is straight. The stage of the Bhagavad Gita represents the reactionary phase of Neo-Brahmanism that came later. This history deserves an account by a modern leftist, and may cure our contemporary New Agers of sentimental views of the history of guruism.\nEast and West? There is no ï¿½philosophicï¿½ East and West, although over time a kind of misleading differentiation arises. Those who find a something called ï¿½Western civilizationï¿½ are really speaking about an artificial construct built around two transitions, whose final effect is a transmission of this mainline out of Sumer back onto the full Eurasian field. The mutual influence of East and West is continual throughout the classical era. Thus, many are the speculations about the interactive influences, viz. the influence of Buddhism on Jesus. We can hardly spot the exact blends, yet we can easily discover the overlap in the Indian, Judaic-Persian, and Greek-Roman cones of diffusion.\nLokayata The Upanishadic age was a close cousin, that is, temporal parallel, of the world of the Pre-Socratics and Sophists, and its spirit was extraordinarily broad, and in many ways deeper. Jawaharlal Nehruï¿½s The Discovery of India describes the contemporary rescue of over fifty thousand Sanskrit manuscripts on what, given the extensive destruction, must have been the great quantity of ancient literature. ï¿½Among the books that have been lost is the entire literature on materialism which followed the period of the early Upanishads.ï¿½ This is the lost world of the ï¿½lokayataï¿½, reflected in the Samkhya. We have become so conditioned to the ï¿½materialï¿½/ ï¿½spiritualï¿½ distinction that we can barely appreciate the way the realm of religion was once cast (among a spectrum of such) as a naturalistic philosophy.\nQuest for the Historical Gita The history of Indian religion is a highly difficult swamp laced with the propaganda of the Hindu reaction to Buddhism. The Gita As It Was, Rediscovering the Original Bhagavadgita, by Phulgenda Sinha , attempts to uncover the text of the original non-theistic Gita from the layers of distorted interpolation that brought it to its present state. The idea of a Buddhist revolution is partly an anachronism, but we do see in the contrast of Buddhism and Hinduism another smoking gun example of an ï¿½eonic effectï¿½.\nAn Evolutionary Psychology: Classical Samkhya The legacy of ancient Samkhya with its universal naturalism might prove of help in a period of extreme reductionist materialism. Charged with materialism Samkhya is then again charged with idealism, and dualism, and shows a remarkable collation of opposites, and a distant resemblance to Kantian thinking. One problem is that this discourse has already been appropriated for any number of metaphysical speculations about cosmic involution, which donï¿½t do justice to the original. At the point where it appears in the Bhagavad Gita it has already lost its original significance. The world of Samkhya points in principle to everything known in the ancient sutras, and this material is late in terms of our eonic Axial period, but still close to its source.\nThe history of Indian philosophy seems determined to place a Kapila right on schedule as an eonic sage, as the creator of Samkhya in the time-period 600 B.C, as though to assist our delineation of eonic architecture. The evidence suggests that it was emerging from an Upanishadic phase that is registered even in the Mahabharata. The exact form that it took in the age of Gautama is not clear, but the influence on Buddhism is so obvious that we can feel confident that the main features of the system were more or less in place in the time of Buddha. This is slightly out of character in the Upanishadic context, as these progress into the consolidation of Hinduism, but we should note that the whole tradition here has never truly been shown to have anything to do with Indo-European, or Vedic, religious traditions.\nThe fate of this system was denunciation by the later Shankarans who had quietly expropriated its terminology and concepts, witness the references in the misleading Bhagavad Gita. And they were not the last. Great later embarrassment rings through the history of mysticism and religion in the fact that the great breakthrough of the classical Indian transition produced a ï¿½materialistï¿½ mysticism. But such a thing was quite natural in the age of Buddha and Mahavir, although we cannot say what the true original form of all this was, for the Shiva cult and its yogi far predate Buddhism. All we see now are the later redactions of the Hindu medieval period, so concerned under the influence of Islam to conceal the whole subject in a monotheistic wrapper.\nThe sutra posits a dualistic distinction of prakriti and purusha. This double aspect model is the key. The ï¿½spiritualï¿½ principle is strictly segregated from the sources of natural manifestation, and these include mind and soul. The ï¿½spiritï¿½ of man is higher ï¿½materialï¿½, and not the same as purusha, which is uncreated, and uncreating. Prakriti comes in two aspects, uncreated, created. It is this unmanifest prakriti that is the obstacle to easy self-realization. The value of the Samkhya approach is to see that one mistakes oneï¿½s spirituality for what is in reality a material manifestation in subtle form. The beauty of the system of Samkhya, the codified echo of some unknown Buddha, as ancient as the speculations of Thales and as deserving of a place in the Smithsonian of proto-science, is its consistency and simplicity: everything is ï¿½materialï¿½ in an all-encompassing naturalism, that is, all is of a piece, matter, energy, mind, purpose, god, and yet beside this is a witness, perhaps misunderstood as ï¿½consciousnessï¿½, a term they did not use, and which mis-portrays the element ï¿½purushaï¿½. It is misleading indeed to translate the term ï¿½purushaï¿½ as consciousness. This ï¿½dualismï¿½ then receives a sort of myth of the relation of the two in a striking image of a kind of evolution as punctuated equilibrium. This witness does nothing, and is neither god nor creator. Everything comes into existence from primordial matter as a cascade of evolutionary triads or gunas, doubling in number in some later formulations: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48,... This aspect is speculative and has degenerated into its own form of bogus cosmic mechanics that found its final burial grounds in the pastiche of such as Ouspensky.\nThe dualism of ï¿½spiritï¿½ and ï¿½matterï¿½ disappears and becomes a ï¿½dialecticï¿½ or triad, in a tetrad including purusha. It is not a dualism of matter and spirit, but a dualism between the ï¿½unnamable, but named, purushaï¿½ and a natural triad, of three ï¿½mattersï¿½. Some of these ï¿½mattersï¿½ are unmanifest, and thatï¿½s what causes the confusion of spiritual samsara. The point is that the higher range of this triad, the ï¿½sattwicï¿½ is confused with the spiritual. Perhaps it is the spiritual, but there is something beyond that. This dialectic is biophysical, the fact of the body, the mind, and the triadic ï¿½connectorï¿½, ï¿½e-motionï¿½, desire, etc,ï¿½ Science might have grown better in this acidic soil, as it thrashes about in Cartesian schizophrenia (although Descartes is attempting a similar gesture), sinking deeper even as Descartes is denounced, unable to get its ï¿½materialismï¿½ in order. Samkhya is one great key to the labyrinth of Indian spirituality, tracing its origins to the era of Buddha.\nSamkhya can be useful as a reminder that religions are not spiritual but upsurges in prakriti. Yogis hitchhike on the form and one day are found to have slipped away as the purusha element, allergic to religion, subtracts their name from the religious roll call. We see the point looking at the eonic effect with its ambiguous, now material, now spiritual, eonic emergents. The distinction of matter and spirit in Western language tends to divide the ï¿½sattwicï¿½ from the whole man to call that the spiritual.

As Peat points out, the doctrines of the immortal soul,       rebirth, and spiritual release are nowhere apparent in the ancient Vedas.       The source of this earlier tradition, and its relation to an equally       ancient Goddess worship, is a mystery, although the presence of yogic       seals in the\nIndus\ncivilization stretches the mystery backward one step.\nAs Professor Paul Deussen remarked, ï¿½When it       is considered that in these passages on the knowledge of brahman as atman, of atman as the all-ensouling principle, and of the destiny of the soul beyond       death, the most important points of the doctrine of the Upanishads are       announced, and that in these not only are the kings portrayed as the       knowers, but the Brahmins specifically shown to have been the non-knowers,       but the Brahmins specifically shown to have been the non-knowers or wrong-knowers       (the texts, moreover, being communicated by the Vedic schoolmen, who were       Brahmins themselves), then one can only draw the conclusionï¿½if not with       absolute surety, at least with considerable likelihoodï¿½that the doctrine       of the atman, which is actually opposed to the whole spirit of       Vedic ritual lore, even though it may at first have designed by Brahmins,       nevertheless was taken up and cultivated not in the circle of Brahmins,       but of Kshatriyas, and only later adapted by the Brahmins.ï¿½ As       Joseph Campbell remarks of this passage, ï¿½Deussen wrote in the late       nineteenth century, before anything was known of the Indus Civilization;       yet he recognized alreadyï¿½as no Indians seem ever to have seenï¿½that       between the Vedic and Upanishadic views the difference is so great that       the latter could not possibly have been developed out of the former.ï¿½ N.

[1] Historically, it encompasses the development of Religion in India since the Iron Age traditions, which in turn hark back to prehistoric religions such as that of the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization followed by the Vedic religion .\nHindu philosophy had six branches, evolving from about the 2nd century BCE to the 6th century CE, viz. Samkhya , Yoga , Nyaya , Vaisheshika , Mimamsa , and Vedanta . Monotheistic religions like Shaivism and Vaishnavism developed during this same period through the Bhakti movement .\nClassical Pauranic Hinduism is established in the Middle Ages, as was Adi Shankara 's Advaita Vedanta which reconciled the Vaishna and Shaiva sects, and gave rise to Smartism , while initiating the decline of the non-Vedantic schools of philosophy.\nHinduism under the Islamic Rulers saw the increasing prominence of the Bhakti movement , which remains influential today. The colonial period saw the emergence of various Hindu reform movements partly inspired by western culture, such as spiritism ( Theosophy ). The Partition of India in 1947 was along religious lines, with the Republic of India emerging with a Hindu majority.\nDuring the 20th century, due to the Indian diaspora , Hindu minorities have formed in all continents, with the largest communities in absolute numbers in the United States and the United Kingdom . In the Republic of India, Hindu nationalism has emerged as a strong political force since the 1980s, the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party forming the Government of India from 1999 to 2004, and its first state government in southern India in 2006.\nContents\n11 External links\nPrehistory\nEvidence of prehistoric religion in India is found in the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization , showing the certain elements of Hinduism such as baths (assumed to serve a ritual purpose) and Symbols , compared to the Shiva lingam [2] [3] . There were also found Swastika signs.\nMany male and female figurines, the female figurines popularly dubbed \"Mother Goddesses\" have been found in the Indus Valley, although some have expressed doubt as to the divine character of these female figures. [4]\nA seal discovered during excavation of the Mohenjo-daro archaeological site in the Indus Valley has drawn attention as a possible representation of a \"yogi\" or \"proto-Shiva\" figure. [5] This \" Pashupati \" (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit paśupati) [6] [7] seal shows a seated figure, possibly ithyphallic, surrounded by animals. [8] [9] [10] Some observers describe the figure as sitting in a traditional cross-legged yoga pose with its hands resting on its knees. The discoverer of the seal, Sir John Marshall, and others have claimed that this figure is a prototype of Shiva, and have described the figure as having three faces, seated in a \"yoga posture\" with the knees out and feet joined.\nVedic period\nFurther information: Iron Age India\nVedism was the sacrificial religion of the early Indo-European -speaking peoples, who entered India from about 1500 BC from the Iranian plateau , via the Hindukush , and mixed up with the local populations. [11]\nThe earliest literature of Hinduism is made up of the four Vedas : the Rig-Veda , Sama-Veda , Yajur-Veda and the Atharva-Veda . Of these, the Rig-Veda is the oldest surviving work. These texts were composed between ca. 1500 and 800 BC, and were transmitted by oral tradition alone until the advent of the Pallava and Gupta period and by a combination of written and oral tradition since then.\nRigvedic religion\nThe geographical horizon of the Rigveda (given with river names , together with the extent of the Swat and Cemetery H ) extends from the Hindu Kush and the Punjab region to the upper Gangetic plain .\nThe earliest text of the Vedas is the Rigveda , a collection of poetic hymns used in the sacrificial rites of Vedic priesthood . Many Rigvedic hymns concern the fire ritual ( Agnihotra ) and especially the offering of Soma to the gods ( Somayajna ). Soma is both an intoxicant and a god itself, as is the sacrificial fire, Agni . The royal horse sacrifice ( Ashvamedha ) is a central rite in the Yajurveda .\nThe gods in the Rig-Veda are mostly personified concepts, who fall into two categories: the devas - who were gods of nature - such as the weather deity Indra (who is also the King of the gods), Agni (\"fire\"), Usha (\"dawn\"), Surya (\"sun\") and Apas (\"waters\") on the one hand, and on the other hand the asuras - gods of moral concepts - such as Mitra (\"contract\"), Aryaman (guardian of guest, friendship and marriage), Bhaga (\"share\") or Varuna , the supreme Asura (or Aditya). While Rigvedic deva is variously applied to most gods, including many of the Asuras, the Devas are characterized as Younger Gods while Asuras are the Older Gods (pūrve devāḥ). In later Vedic texts, the Asuras become demons.\nThe Rigveda has 10 Mandalas ('books'). There is significant variation in the language and style between the family books (RV books 2-7), book 8 , the \"Soma Mandala\" ( RV 9 ), and the more recent books 1 and 10 . The older books share many aspects of common Indo-Iranian religion, and is an important source for the reconstruction of earlier common Indo-European traditions . Especially RV 8 has striking similarity to the Avesta , [12] containing allusions to Afghan Flora and Fauna [13] , e.g. to camels (úṣṭra- = Avestan uštra). Many of the central religious terms in Vedic Sanskrit have cognates in the religious vocabulary of other Indo-European languages (deva: Latin deus; hotar : Germanic god ; asura: Germanic ansuz ; yajna : Greek hagios ; brahman : Norse Bragi or perhaps Latin flamen etc.). Especially notable is the fact, that in the Avesta Asura (Ahura) is known as good and Deva (Daeva) as evil entity, quite the opposite of the RigVeda.\nBrahmanism\nFurther information: Brahmana ,  Aranyaka , and  Shrauta Sutra\nMap of early Iron Age Vedic India after Witzel (1989). Location hypotheses for Vedic shakhas are shown in green.\nIn Iron Age India , during a period roughly spanning the 10th to 6th centuries BC, the Mahajanapadas arise from the earlier petty kingdoms of the various Rigvedic tribes , and the failing remnants of the Late Harappan culture. In this period the mantra portions of the Vedas are largely completed, and a flowering industry of Vedic priesthood organized in numerous schools ( shakha ) develops exegetical literature, viz. the Brahmanas . These schools also edited the Vedic mantra portions into fixed recensions, that were to be preserved purely by oral tradition over the following two millennia.\nThis period of dominance of priestly Brahmanic Hinduism declines with the appearance of mystical traditions (the oldest Upanishads , BAU , ChU and JUB besides the Shatapatha Brahmana ) attacking the rigid ritualism available only to the elite, in favour of spiritual insight through asceticism and meditation . The rise of Buddhism at this time, according to tradition originating with Gautama Buddha , a 6th century BC Hindu prince, renouncing his status for enlightenment , is exemplary of this tendency. Politically, the Mahajanapadas declined, in the west falling to the invasion of Darius the Great , and from the east absorbed into the Magadha Empire which as the Maurya Empire would encompass almost the whole subcontinent by the time of Ashoka .\nVedism today\nVedism as the religious tradition of Hinduism of a priestly elite was marginalized by other traditions such as Jainism and Buddhism in the later Iron Age, but in the Middle Ages would rise to renewed prestige with the Mimamsa school, which as well as all other astika traditions of Hinduism, considered them authorless ( apaurusheyatva ) and eternal. A last surviving elements of Vedic Hinduism or Vedism is Śrauta tradition, following many major elements of Vedic religion and is prominent in Southern India , with communities in Tamil Nadu , Kerala , Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , but also in some pockets of Uttar Pradesh , Maharashtra and other states; the best known of these groups are the Nambudiri of Kerala, whose traditions were notably documented by Frits Staal . [14] [15] [16]\nAncient India\nHinduism in the narrow sense (to the exclusion of Vedism and Iron Age Brahmanism) is the new religious mainstream arising with the decline of Buddhism in India and from about the 4th century AD.\nMauryan and Sangam period\nFurther information: Sangam literature\nThe Mauryan period saw an early flowering of classical Sanskrit Sutra and Shastra literature and the scholarly exposition of the \"circum-Vedic\" fields of the Vedanga . However, during this time Buddhism was patronized by Ashoka , who ruled large parts of India, and Buddhism was also the mainstream religion until the Gupta empire period.\nThe Sangam literature (300 BC - 300 AD) is a mostly secular body of classical literature in the Tamil language . Nonetheless there are some works, significantly Pattupathu and Paripaatal, wherein the personal devotion to god was written in form of devotional poems. Vishnu , Shiva and Murugan were mentioned gods. These works are therefore the earliest evidences of monotheistic Bhakti traditions, preceding the large bhakti movement , which will given great attention in later times.\nGupta and Pallava period\nFurther information: Hindu philosophy ,  Mimamsa , and  Samkhya\nThe Pallavas (4th to 9th centuries) were, alongside the Guptas of the North , patronizers of Sanskrit in the South of the Subcontinent . The pallava reign saw the first Sankrit inscriptions in a script called Grantha . Early Pallavas had different connections to South-East Asian countries. The Pallavas used Dravidian architecture to build some very important Hindu temples and academies in Mamallapuram , Kanchipuram and other places; their rule saw the rise of great poets, who are as famous as Kalidasa .\nThe Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries) saw a flowering of scholarship, the emergence of the classical schools of Hindu philosophy , and of classical Sanskrit literature in general on topics ranging from medicine, veterinary science, mathematics, to astrology and astronomy and astrophysics. The famous Aryabhata and Varahamihira belong to this age. The Gupta established a strong central government which also allowed a degree of local control. Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs. This included a strict caste system, or class system. The peace and prosperity created under Gupta leadership enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors.\nThe practice of dedicating temples to different deities came into vogue followed by fine artistic temple architecture and sculpture (see Vastu Shastra ).\nExpansion in South-East Asia\nFurther information: Hinduism in Southeast Asia ,  Indianized kingdom , and  Sanskritisation\nExpansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.\nFrom about the 1st century , India started to strongly influence Southeast Asian countries. Trade routes linked India with southern Burma , central and southern Siam , lower Cambodia and southern Vietnam and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.\nFor more than a thousand years, Indian Hindu/Buddhist influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The Pali and Sanskrit languages and the Indian script, together with Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism , Brahmanism and Hinduism , were transmitted from direct contact as well as through sacred texts and Indian literature, such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata epics.\nFrom the 5th to the 13th century , South-East Asia had very powerful Indian colonial empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The Sri Vijaya Empire to the south and the Khmer Empire to the north competed for influence.\nLangkasuka (-langkha Sanskrit for \"resplendent land\" -sukkha of \"bliss\") was a ancient Hindu kingdom located in the Malay Peninsula . The kingdom, along with Old Kedah settlement, are probably the earliest territorial footholds founded on the Malay Peninsula. According to tradition, the founding of the kingdom happened in the 2nd century ; Malay legends claim that Langkasuka was founded at Kedah , and later moved to Pattani .\nFrom the 5th- 15th centuries Sri Vijayan empire , a maritime empire centered on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia , had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism under a line of rulers named the Sailendras . The Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the Chola rulers of India. The Majapahit Empire succeeded the Singhasari empire. It was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in Maritime Southeast Asia .\nFunan was a pre- Angkor Cambodian kingdom, located around the Mekong delta, probably established by Mon-Khmer settlers speaking an Austro-Asiatic language. According to reports by two Chinese envoys, K'ang T'ai and Chu Ying, the state was established by an Indian Brahmin named Kaundinya , who in the first century C.E. was given instruction in a dream to take a magic bow from a temple and defeat a Khmer queen, Soma. Soma, the daughter of the king of the Nagas, married Kaundinya and their lineage became the royal dynasty of Funan. The myth had the advantage of providing the legitimacy of both an Indian Brahmin and the divinity of the cobras, who at that time were held in religious regard by the inhabitants of the region.\nThe kingdom of Champa (or Lin-yi in Chinese records) controlled what is now south and central Vietnam from approximately 192 through 1697 . The dominant religion of the Cham people was Hinduism and the culture was heavily influenced by India .\nLater, from the 9th to the 13th century , the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu Khmer Empire dominated much of the South-East Asian peninsula. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. Angkor was at the center of this development, with a temple complex and urban organization able to support around one million urban dwellers. The largest temple complex of the world , Angkor Wat , stands here; built by the king Vishnuvardhan , a king of the dynasty that believed themselves to be incarnations of Vishnu.\nMiddle Ages\nBy the 8th century, the \"Hindu golden age\" of the past millennium was over. The formerly rich philosophic literature tended to be reduced to scholastic quarreling and infighting between innumerable sects, notably between emerging traditions of Vaishnavism and Shaivism . Adi Shankara in the 8th century managed to reconcile the antagonistic sects and to establish Hinduism as a single, if diverse, religious tradition. The compilation of the Puranas provided a mythical backdrop for this tradition, and served as a means of acculturation of the various pre-literate tribal societies to the new religious mainstream. Various reforms of the later Middle Ages, notably the Bhakti movement , besides new Yogic schools ( Jnana yoga , Karma yoga , Hatha yoga , Bhakti yoga ) gave Hinduism its classical form as described by the 18th to 19th century pioneers of Indology .\nBhakti movement\nSee also: Tulsidas , Kabir , Mirabai , and Chaitanya\nThe Bhakti movement was a Hindu religious movement in which the main spiritual practice was the fostering of loving devotion to God, called bhakti . It was a monotheistic movement generally devoted to worship of Shiva , Vishnu or Shakti .\nThe first documented bhakti movement was founded by Karaikkal-ammaiyar . She wrote poems in Tamil about her love for Shiva and probably lived around the 6th century CE. 1 , 2 , 3 The twelve Alvars who were Vaishnavite devotees and the sixty-three Nayanars who were Shaivite devotees nurtured the incipient bhakti movement in Tamil Nadu . They constitute South India's 75 Apostles of Bhakti .\nDuring the 12th century CE in Karnataka, the Bhakti movement took the form of the Virashaiva movement. It was inspired by Basavanna , a Hindu reformer who created the sect of Lingayats or Shiva bhaktas. During this time, a unique and native form of Kannada literature-poetry called Vachanas was born.\nAdvaita Vedanta\nMain articles: Advaita Vedanta and Adi Shankara\nThe introduction of Advaita Vedanta by Adi Shankara unified the theistic sects into a common framework of Shanmata system. Shankara stressed the importance of the Vedas, introducing the concept of apaurusheyatva , and his efforts helped Hinduism regain strength and popularity. He is the main figure in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta . He is the founder of the Dashanami Sampradaya of Hindu monasticism and Shanmata tradition of worship. He travelled all over India ( Kerala to Kashmir and Nepal ) three times over and was a major cause in the revival and integration of Sanatana Dharma. Shankara's reform essentially eclipsed all earlier schools of Hindu philosophy and became the nucleus of the medieval traditions, including Smartism and Sant Mat lineages, [17] that lead up to the current religion.\nAdi Shankara, along with Madhva and Ramanuja , were instrumental in the revival of Hinduism. In their writings and debates, they provided polemics against the non-Vedantic schools of Sankhya , Vaisheshika etc. Thus, they paved the way for Vedanta to be the dominant and most widely followed tradition among the schools of Hindu philosophy.\nPauranic Hinduism\nFurther information: Puranas\nBrahmanic Hinduism evolves out of Vedism during Iron Age India, and in turn contributes to the development of Vedantic and eventually classical Pauranic Hinduism . The transformation of Brahmanism into Pauranic Hinduism in post- Gupta India was due to a process of acculturation . The Puranas helped establish a religious mainstream among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation. The tenets of Brahmanic Hinduism and of the Dharmashastras underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of a mainstream \"Hinduism\" that overshadowed all earlier traditions. [18]\nHindu secular scholarship and the Islamic Middle East\nHindu and also Buddhist religious and secular learning had first reached the Middle East in an organised manner in the sixth century, when the great Sassanid Emperor Khosrau I (531–579) deputed the famous Borzuya the physician as his envoy, to invite Indian and Chinese scholars to the Academy of Gundishapur , then the greatest centre of learning in his vast Afro-Asian empire. Contributions on ancient Greek and Roman learning were already being made in the Academy, mainly by the Jewish and Nestorian scholars, who were escaping the harsh persecution by the Byzantine Empire 's Christian orthodoxy. With the help of these 'visiting professors' from the East, translations in Pahlavi , the imperial language, were made of Indian and Chinese texts on astronomy, astrology, mathematics, medicine – including herbal materia medica – and religion. Burzoe himself had translated the now world famous Sanskrit book of fables named Panchatantra ,in which animals interact in complex ways to convey teachings to princes in policy. His Pahlavi version was translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Moqaffa under the title of Kalila and Dimna or The Fables of Bidpai; it became one of the greatest prose classics of the Arabs and is considered the first masterpiece that introduced literary prose narrative to Arabic.\nDuring the enlightened Abbasid Caliphacy, Baghdad had replaced Gundishapur as the most important centre of learning in the then vast Islamic Empire , wherein the traditions as well as scholars of the latter flourished. Hindu scholars were invited to the conferences on sciences and mathematics held in Baghdad , in which they contributes the latest 'Updates' in their fields. Indian contributions in secular disciplines thus reached the Arabs , had significant impact on them, and through them on the West . Decimal system of numbers, use of zero as one the numerals and the shapes of numerals in modern languages are a testimony to these contributions.\nEleventh century Middle East and Europe studied India's latest in several fields, e.g. Indian Medicine and 'comparative religion', through the treatises of Muslim scholars like Avicena and Al-Beruni .\nMuslim conquests\nFurther information: Muslim conquest of South Asia\nMuslim rulers began to extend their rule across Hindu-Buddhist populated lands in the 8th century CE and the Abrahamic religion of Islam began to spread across the Indian-subcontinent over several centuries. Most converts were from Hinduism or Buddhism , the two dominant local religions. While all traditions of popular Hinduism continued - including the worship of popular reincarnations of the primordial Shakti - Bhakti tradition attained new prominence; Bhakti poetry of lasting greatness was composed in northern India under the rule of Muslim emperors. The humble mystic saint Kabir , who established his own order, composed devotional verses in the Bhakti spirit, but in common-man's Hindi dialect and transcendenting Hindu-Muslim theocratic divide. Tulsidas , Mira Bai and Surdas composed immortal Hindu devotional poetry in Hindi-dialects in the Mughal period - it is reminiscent of the earlier Kannada and Tamil Bhakti poetry of South India.\nMughal India\nFurther information: Mughal period\nAfter the conquest of Persia by the Mongol Empire , a regional Turko-Persio-Mongol dynasty formed. Just as eastern Mongol dynasties inter-married with locals and adopted the local religion of Buddhism and the Chinese culture , this group adopted the local religion of Islam and the Persian culture ; their descendants ruled in India as Mughals .\nThe official State religion of the Mughal Empire was Islam , with the preference to the jurisprudence of the Hanafi Madhab (Mazhab). However, throughout its history, subjects had complete freedom to practice any religion of their choice, though Non-Muslim able-bodied adult males with income were obliged to pay the Jizya (poll-tax to be spent by the State only on protection of non-Muslims), which signified their status as Dhimmis (responsibility of the State, in regard to safety of life and property).\nAkbar the Great , Mughal emperor Humayun 's son and heir from his Sindhi queen Hameeda Banu Begum, had a broad vision of Indian and Islamic traditions. One of Emperor Akbar 's most unusual ideas regarding religion was Din-i-Ilahi (Faith of God), which was an eclectic mix of Islam , Zoroastrianism , Hinduism, Jainism and Christianity . It was proclaimed the state religion until his death. These actions however met with stiff opposition from the Muslim clergy, especially the Sufi Shaykh Alf Sani Ahmad Sirhindi . Akbar's abolition of poll-tax on non-Muslims, acceptance of ideas from other religious philosophies, toleration of public worship by all religions and his interest in other faiths showed an attitude of considerable religious tolerance, which, in the minds of his orthodox Muslim opponents, were tantamount to apostasy .\nAkbar's son, Emperor Jahangir , half Rajput, was also a religious moderate, his mother being Hindu. The influence of his two Hindu queens (the Maharani Maanbai and Maharani Jagat) kept religious moderation as a center-piece of state policy which was extended under his son, Emperor Shah Jahan , who was by blood 75% Rajput and less than 25% Moghul .\nReligious orthodoxy would only play an important role during the reign of Shah Jahan's son and successor, Aurangzeb , a devout Sunni Muslim. Aurangzeb was comparatively less tolerant of other faiths than his predecessors had been, and his reign saw an increase in the number and importance of Islamic institutions and scholars. He led many military campaigns against the remaining non-Muslim powers of the Indian subcontinent - the Sikh states of the Punjab, the last independent Hindu Rajputs and the Maratha rebels - as also against the Shia Muslim kingdoms of the Deccan . He also virtually stamped out, from his empire, open proselytisation of Hindus and Muslims by foreign Christian Missionaries , who remained successfully active, however, in the adjoining regions: the present day Kerala , Tamilnadu and Goa .\nOrissa (known as Kalinga and Utkala in ancient period) remained a powerful Hindu kingdom under different monarchs till 17 century. The Muslim positions in Bengal and Deccan were seriously threatened by Gajapati Kings of Orissa.\nEarly Modern period\nThe fall of Vijayanagar Empire to Muslim rulers had marked the end of Hindu imperial assertions in the Deccan . But, taking advantage of an over-stretched Mughal Empire , Hinduism once again rose to political prestige, under the Maratha Empire , from 1707 to 1761 .\nMaratha Empire\nThe last Hindu empire of India - The Maratha Empire in 1760 .\nThe Hindu Marathas long had lived in the Desh region around Satara , in the western portion of the Deccan plateau, where the plateau meets the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats mountains. They had resisted incursions into the region by the Muslim Mughal rulers of northern India. Under their ambitious leader Shivaji , the Maratha freed themselves from the Muslim sultans of Bijapur to the southeast and, becoming much more aggressive, began to frequently raid Mughal territory, eventually sacking the wealthy Mughal port of Surat in 1664. After substantial territorial gains, Shivaji was proclaimed 'Chatrapati' (Emperor) in 1674; the Marathas had spread and conquered much of central India by Shivaji's death in 1680. Subsequently, under the able leadership of Brahmin prime ministers ( Peshwas ), who often led as generals also, Maratha Empire reached its zenith. Pune , the seat of Peshwas, flowered as a centre of Hindu learning and traditions. In 1761, the empire broke into smaller Maratha kingdoms that survived till they were eventually subdued by the British East India Company .\nEarly colonialism\nFurther information: Christianity in India  and  Goa Inquisition\nPortuguese missionaries had reached the Malabar Coast in the late 15th century , made contact with the St Thomas Christians in Kerala and sought to introduce the Latin Rite among them. Since the priests for St Thomas Christians were served by the Eastern Christian Churches , they were following Eastern Christian practices at that time. Throughout this period, foreign missionaries also made many new converts to Christianity. This led to the formation of the Latin Catholics in Kerala.\nThe Goa Inquisition was the office of the Christian Inquisition acting in the Indian city of Goa and the rest of the Portuguese empire in Asia . St. Francis Xavier , in a 1545 letter to John III , requested for an Inquisition to be installed in Goa. It was installed eight years after the death of Francis Xavier in 1552 . Established in 1560 and operating until 1774 , this highly controversial institution was aimed primarily at Hindus and wayward new converts.\nIn the century from 1760 to 1860, India was once more divided into numerous petty and unstable kingdoms: the Sikh Confederacy ; the \"lesser Mughals\" following Bahadur Shah I ; the Kingdom of Mysore ; Hyderabad State ; the Durrani Empire ; and the territories held by the British East India Company . The entire subcontinent fell under British rule (partly indirectly , via Princely states ) following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 .\nBritish Raj\nFurther information: Bengal Renaissance ,  Brahmo Samaj ,  Arya Samaj , and  Ramakrishna Math\n1909 Prevailing Religions, Map of British Indian Empire, 1909, showing the prevailing majority religions of the population for different districts.\nDuring the 19th century, Hinduism developed a large number of new religious movements , partly inspired by the European Romanticism , nationalism , scientific racism and esotericism ( Theosophy ) popular at the time (while conversely and contemporaneously, India had a similar effect on European culture with Orientalism , \" Hindoo style \" architecture, reception of Buddhism in the West and similar).\nThese reform movements are summarized under Hindu revivalism and continue into the present.\nSahajanand Swami establishes the Swaminarayan Sampraday sect around 1800.\nBrahmo Samaj is a social and religious movement founded in Kolkata in 1828 by Raja Ram Mohan Roy . He was one of the first Indians to visit Europe and was influenced by western thought. He died in Bristol , England . The Brahmo Samaj movement thereafter resulted in the Brahmo religion in 1850 founded by Debendranath Tagore — better known as the father of Rabindranath Tagore .\nSri Ramakrishna and his pupil Swami Vivekananda led a reform in Hinduism in late 19th century. Their ideals and sayings have inspired numerous Indians as well as non-Indians, Hindus as well as non-Hindus. Among the prominent figures whose ideals were very much influenced by them were Rabindranath Tagore , Gandhi , Subhas Bose , Satyendranath Bose , Megh Nad Saha , and Sister Nivedita [citation needed].\nArya Samaj (\"Society of Nobles \") is a Hindu reform movement in India that was founded by Swami Dayananda in 1875 . He was a sannyasin (renouncer) who believed in the infallible authority of the Vedas . Dayananda advocated the doctrine of karma and reincarnation , and emphasised the ideals of brahmacharya ( chastity ) and sanyasa ( renunciation ). Dayananda claimed to be rejecting all non-Vedic beliefs altogether. Hence the Arya Samaj unequivocally condemned idolatry , animal sacrifices , ancestor worship , pilgrimages , priestcraft , offerings made in temples , the caste system, untouchability and child marriages , on the grounds that all these lacked Vedic sanction. It aimed to be a universal church based on the authority of the Vedas . Dayananda stated that he wanted 'to make the whole world Aryan', i.e. he wanted to develop missionary Hinduism based on the universality of the Vedas. To this end, the Arya Samaj started Shuddhi movement in early 20th century to bring back to Hinduism people converted to Islam and Christianity , set up schools and missionary organisations, and extended its activities outside India. It now has branches around the world and has a disproportional number of adherents among people of Indian ancestry in Suriname and the Netherlands , in comparison with India.[citation needed]\nReception in the West\nFurther information: Sanskrit in the West ,  Esotericism in Germany and Austria , and  Ramakrishna's impact\nAn important development during the British colonial period was the influence Hindu traditions began to form on Western thought and new religious movements . An early champion of Indian-inspired thought in the West was Arthur Schopenhauer who in the 1850s advocated ethnics based on an \"Aryan-Vedic theme of spiritual self-conquest\", as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism of the superficially this-worldly \"Jewish\" spirit. [19] Helena Blavatsky moved to India in 1879, and her Theosophical Society , founded in New York in 1875, evolved into a peculiar mixture of Western occultism and Hindu mysticism over the last years of her life.\nThe sojourn of Vivekananda to the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 had a lasting effect. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission , a Hindu missionary organization still active today.\nIn the early 20th century, Western occultists influenced by Hinduism include Maximiani Portaz - an advocate of \"Aryan Paganism\" - who styled herself Savitri Devi and Jakob Wilhelm Hauer , founder of the German Faith Movement . It was in this period, and until the 1920s , that the swastika became an ubiquitous symbol of goodlooks in the West before its association with the Nazi Party became dominant in the 1930s.\nHinduism-inspired elements in Theosophy were also inherited by the spin-off movements of Ariosophy and Anthroposophy and ultimately contributed to the renewed New Age boom of the 1960s to 1980s, the term New Age itself deriving from Blavatsky's 1888 The Secret Doctrine .\nContemporary Hinduism\nMain articles: Contemporary Hindu movements , Hindu denominations , Contemporary Sant Mat movements , List of Hindu organisations , and Hinduism by country\nAs of 2007, of an estimated 944 million Hindus, 98.5% live in South Asia. Of the remaining 1.5% or 14 million, 6 million live in Southeast Asia (mostly Indonesia ), 2 million in Europe , 1.8 million in North America , 1.2 million in Southern Africa .\nSouth Asia\nModern Hinduism is the reflection of continuity and progressive changes that occurred in various traditions and institutions of Hinduism during the 19th and 20th centuries . Its main divisions are into Vaishnavism (largely influenced by Bhakti ), Shaivism , Shaktism and Smartism ( Advaita Vedanta ).\nBesides these traditional denominations, movements of Hindu revivalism look to founders such as Swami Vivekananda , Swami Dayananda ( Arya Samaj ), Rabindranath Tagore , Ramana Maharshi , Aurobindo , Shriram Sharma Acharya , Swami Sivananda , Swami Rama Tirtha , Narayana Guru , Paramhansa Yogananda , Shrii Shrii Anandamurti , Pandurang Shastri Athavale ( Swadhyay Movement ) and others.\nThe Hindutva movement advocating Hindu nationalism originated in the 1920s and has remained a strong political force in India. The major party of the religious right, Bharatiya Janata Party , since its foundation in 1980 has won several elections, and after a defeat in 2004 remains the leading force of opposition against the current Congress Party government.\nSoutheast Asia\nThe resurgence of Hinduism in Indonesia is occurring in all parts of the country. In the early seventies, the Toraja people of Sulawesi were the first to be identified under the umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the Karo Batak of Sumatra in 1977 and the Ngaju Dayak of Kalimantan in 1980.\nThe growth of Hinduism has been driven also by the famous Javanese prophesies of Sabdapalon and Jayabaya . Many recent converts to Hinduism had been members of the families of Sukarno 's PNI, and now support Megawati Sukarnoputri . This return to the 'religion of Majapahit ' (Hinduism) is a matter of nationalist pride.\nThe new Hindu communities in Java tend to be concentrated around recently built temples (pura) or around archaeological temple sites (candi) which are being reclaimed as places of Hindu worship. An important new Hindu temple in eastern Java is Pura Mandaragiri Sumeru Agung, located on the slope of Mt. Semeru , Java's highest mountain. Mass conversions have also occurred in the region around Pura Agung Blambangan, another new temple, built on a site with minor archaeological remnants attributed to the kingdom of Blambangan , the last Hindu polity on Java, and Pura Loka Moksa Jayabaya (in the village of Menang near Kediri).\nNeo-Hindu movements in the west",
                "History of Hinduism\nHistory of Hinduism\nGlossary of Hinduism terms\nHistory of Hinduism denotes a wide variety of related Hindu denominations native to the Indian Subcontinent , most of whom live in modern-day Nepal and India . [1] Its history overlaps or coincides with the development of Indian religions since Iron Age India . It has thus been called the “oldest living religion” in the world. [note 1] Scholars regard Hinduism as a synthesis [2] [3] [4] of various Indian cultures and traditions, [3] [5] [2] with diverse roots [6] and no single founder or source. [7] [note 2]\nThe history of Hinduism is often divided into periods of development, with the first period being that of the historical Vedic religion dated from about 1900 BCE to 1400 BCE. [8] [note 3] The subsequent period, between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, is “a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions”, [11] and a formative period for Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. The Epic and Early Puranic period, from c. 200 BCE to 500 CE, saw the classical “Golden Age” of Hinduism ((c. 320-650 CE), which coincides with the Gupta Empire . In this period the six branches of Hindu philosophy evolved, namely Samkhya , Yoga , Nyaya , Vaisheshika , Mīmāṃsā , and Vedanta . Monotheistic sects like Shaivism and Vaishnavism developed during this same period through the Bhakti movement . The period from roughly 650 to 1100 CE forms the late Classical period [12] or early Middle Ages, in which classical Pauranic Hinduism is established, and Adi Shankara ‘s Advaita Vedanta , which incorporated Buddhist thought into Vedanta, marking a shift from realistic to idealistic thought.\nHinduism under both Hindu and Islamic rulers from c. 1200 to 1750 CE, [13] [14] saw the increasing prominence of the Bhakti movement, which remains influential today. The colonial period saw the emergence of various Hindu reform movements partly inspired by western movements, such as Unitarianism and Theosophy . The Partition of India in 1947 was along religious lines, with the Republic of India emerging with a Hindu majority. During the 20th century, due to the Indian diaspora , Hindu minorities have formed in all continents, with the largest communities in absolute numbers in the United States and the United Kingdom . In the Republic of India, Hindu nationalism has emerged as a strong political force since the 1980s, the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party forming the Government of India from 1999 to 2004, and its first state government in South India in 2006, and also the Narendra Modi led Government from 2014.\nContents\n15 External links\nRoots of Hinduism\nWestern scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion [2] [note 4] or synthesis [3] [note 5] of various Indian cultures and traditions. [3] [note 6] Among its roots are the historical Vedic religion of Iron Age India [15] [5] itself already the product of “a composite of the Indo-Aryan and Harappan cultures and civilizations”, [16] [note 7] but also the Sramana [17] or renouncer traditions [5] of northeast India , [17] and mesolithic [18] and neolithic [19] cultures of India, such as the religions of the Indus Valley Civilisation , [20] Dravidian traditions, [21] and the local traditions [5] and tribal religions . [22]\nAfter the Vedic period, between 500 [3] -200 [23] BCE and c. 300 CE, [3] at the beginning of the “Epic and Puranic” c.q. “Preclassical” period, the “Hindu synthesis” emerged, [3] [23] which incorporated śramaṇic [23] [24] and Buddhist influences [23] [25] and the emerging bhakti tradition into the Brahmanical fold via the smriti literature. [26] [23] This synthesis emerged under the pressure of the success of Buddhism and Jainism. [27] During the Gupta reign the first Puranas were written, [28] [note 8] which were used to disseminate “mainstream religious ideology amongst pre-literate and tribal groups undergoing acculturation.” [28] The resulting Puranic Hinduism differed markedly from the earlier Brahmanism of the Dharmaśāstras and the smritis. [28] [note 9] Hinduism co-existed for several centuries with Buddhism, [29] to finally gain the upper hand at all levels in the 8th century. [30] [web 1] [note 10]\nFrom northern India this “Hindu synthesis”, and its societal divisions, spread to southern India and parts of Southeast Asia . [31] [note 11] [note 12] [note 13] It was aided by the settlement of Brahmins on land granted by local rulers, [32] [33] the incorporation and assimilation of popular non-Vedic gods, [web 2] [34] [note 14] and the process of Sanskritization , in which “people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms”. [web 2] [note 15] [35] This process of assimilation explains the wide diversity of local cultures in India “half shrouded in a taddered cloak of conceptual unity.” [36]\nPeriodisation\nTimeline\nJames Mill (1773–1836), in his The History of British India (1817), distinguished three phases in the history of India, namely Hindu, Muslim and British civilisations. This periodisation has been criticised, for the misconceptions it has given rise to. Another periodisation is the division into “ancient, classical, medieval and modern periods”, although this periodization has also received criticism. [37]\nRomila Thapar notes that the division of Hindu-Muslim-British periods of Indian history gives too much weight to “ruling dynasties and foreign invasions,” [38] neglecting the social-economic history which often showed a strong continuity. [38] The division in Ancient-Medieval-Modern overlooks the fact that the Muslim-conquests took place between the eight and the fourteenth century, while the south was never completely conquered. [38] According to Thapar, a periodisation could also be based on “significant social and economic changes,” which are not strictly related to a change of ruling powers. [39] [note 16]\nSmart and Michaels seem to follow Mill’s periodisation, while Flood and Muesse follow the “ancient, classical, mediaeval and modern periods” periodisation. An elaborate periodisation may be as follows: [12]\nPre-history and Indus Valley Civilisation (until c. 1750 BCE);\nVedic period (c. 1750-500 BCE);\n“Second Urbanisation” (c. 600-200 BCE);\nClassical Period (c. 200 BCE-1200 CE); [note 17]\nPre-classical period (c. 200 BCE-300 CE);\n“Golden Age” (Gupta Empire) (c. 320-650 CE);\nLate-Classical period (c. 650-1200 CE);\nMedieval Period (c. 1200-1500 CE);\nEarly Modern Period (c. 1500-1850);\nModern period (British Raj and independence) (from c. 1850).\nHistory of Hinduism\nJames Mill (1773–1836), in his The History of British India (1817), [a] distinguished three phases in the history of India, namely Hindu, Muslim and British civilisations. [b] [c] This periodisation has been influential, but has also been criticised, for the misconceptions it has given rise to. [d] Another influential periodisation is the division into “ancient, classical, mediaeval and modern periods”. [e]\nMuesse, Mark William (2003). Great World Religions: Hinduism .\nMuesse, Mark W.

Kampen: Uitgeverij Kok.\nPrevedic religions (until c. 1750 BCE)\nPrehistory\nAnatomically modern humans are thought to have arrived in South India about 75,000 – 60,000 years back, [40] [41] during Paleolithic times. These people were Australoids who may have been closely related to Aboriginal Australians . [web 3] They are probably almost extinct or largely covered by successive waves. [42]\nAfter the Australoids, Caucasoids , including both Elamo-Dravidians (c. 4,000 [43] to 6,000 [44] BCE) and Indo-Aryans (c.2,000 [45] -1,500 BCE [46] ), and Mongoloids ( Sino-Tibetans ) immigrated into India. The Elamo-Dravidians [note 18] possibly from Elam , present-day Iran, [43] [44] [47] [note 19] and the Tibeto-Burmans possibly from the Himalayan and north-eastern borders of the subcontinent. [note 20]\nThe earliest prehistoric religion in India that may have left its traces in Hinduism comes from mesolithic as observed in the sites such as the rock paintings of Bhimbetka rock shelters dating to a period of 30,000 BCE or older, [note 21] as well as neolithic times. [note 22] Some of the religious practices can be considered to have originated in 4,000 BCE. Several tribal religions still exist, though “[w]e must not assume that there are many similarities between prehistoric and contemporary tribal communities”. [web 4]\nIndus Valley Civilization (c. 3300–1700 BCE)\nThe so-called Shiva Pashupati seal from Indus Valley Civilization\nSome Indus valley seals show swastikas , which are found in other religions worldwide. Phallic symbols interpreted as the much later Hindu linga have been found in the Harappan remains. [48] [49]\nSwastika Seals from the Indus Valley Civilization preserved at the British Museum\nMany Indus valley seals show animals. One seal shows a horned figure seated in a posture reminiscent of the Lotus position and surrounded by animals was named by early excavators “ Pashupati “, an epithet of the later Hindu gods Shiva and Rudra . [50] [51] [52] Writing in 1997, Doris Meth Srinivasan said, “Not too many recent studies continue to call the seal’s figure a “Proto-Siva,” rejecting thereby Marshall’s package of proto-Shiva features, including that of three heads. She interprets what John Marshall interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man. [53] According to Iravatham Mahadevan , symbols 47 and 48 of his Indus script glossary The Indus Script: Texts, Concordance and Tables (1977), representing seated human-like figures, could describe the South Indian deity Murugan . [54]\nIn view of the large number of figurines found in the Indus valley, some scholars believe that the Harappan people worshipped a mother goddess symbolizing fertility, a common practice among rural Hindus even today. [55] However, this view has been disputed by S. Clark who sees it as an inadequate explanation of the function and construction of many of the figurines. [56]\nThere are no religious buildings or evidence of elaborate burials… If there were temples, they have not been identified. [57] However, House – 1 in HR-A area in Mohenjadaro’s Lower Town has been identified as a possible temple. [58]\nVedic period (c. 1750–500 BCE)\nThe commonly proposed period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to 2nd millennium BCE. [59] Vedism was the sacrificial religion of the early Indo-Aryans , speakers of early Old Indic dialects, ultimately deriving from the Proto-Indo-Iranian peoples of the Bronze Age.

The Andronovo , BMAC and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo-Iranian migrations. The GGC , Cemetery H , Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with Indo-Aryan movements.\nEarly Vedic Period.\nThe Vedic period, named after the Vedic religion of the Indo-Aryans , [60] [note 24] lasted from c. 1750 to 500 BCE. [61] [note 25] The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-European language family, which many scholars believe originated in Kurgan culture of the Central Asian steppes . [62] [47] [note 26] [note 27] Indeed, the Vedic religion, including the names of certain deities, was in essence a branch of the same religious tradition as the ancient Greeks, Romans, Persians, and Germanic peoples. For example, the Vedic god Dyaus Pita is a variant of the Proto-Indo-European god *Dyēus ph2ter (or simply *Dyēus), from which also derive the Greek Zeus and the Roman Jupiter . Similarly the Vedic Manu and Yama derive from the PIE *Manu and *Yemo, from which also derive the Germanic Mannus and Ymir .\nThe Indo-Aryans were pastoralists [63] who migrated into north-western India after the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization, [64] [65] [66] [note 28] The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-Iranians , which originated in the Andronovo culture [67] in the Bactria - Margiana era, in present northern Afghanistan. [68] The roots of this culture go back further to the Sintashta culture , with funeral sacrifices which show close parallels to the sacrificial funeral rites of the Rig Veda . [69]\nThe Indo-Aryans split-off around 1800-1600 BCE from the Iranians, [70] where-after they were defeated and split into two groups by the Iranians, [71] who dominated the Central Eurasian steppe zone [72] and “chased them to the extermities of Central Eurasia.” [72] One group were the Indo-Aryans who founded the Mitanni kingdom in northern Syria [68] (ca.1500-1300 BCE). The other group were the Vedic people, who were pursued by the Iranians “across the Near East to the Levant (the lands of the eastern Mediterranean littoral), across Iran into India.” [73]\nDuring the Early Vedic period (c. 1500 – 1100 BCE [63] ) Vedic tribes were pastoralists, wandering around in north-west India. [74] After 1100 BCE, with the introduction of iron, the Vedic tribes moved into the western Ganges Plain, adapting an agrarian lifestyle. [63] [75] [76] Rudimentary state-forms appeared, of which the Kuru -tribe and realm was the most influential. [63] [77] It was a tribal union, which developed into the first recorded state-level society in South Asia around 1000 BCE. [63] It decisively changed the Vedic heritage of the early Vedic period, collecting the Vedic hymns into collections, and developing new rituals which gained their position in Indian civilization as the orthodox srauta rituals, [63] which contributed to the so-called “classical synthesis” [78] or “Hindu synthesis” . [3]\nRigvedic religion\nThe Indo-Aryans brought with them their language [79] and religion. [46] [80] The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion , [81] [82] and the Indo-Iranian religion. [83] According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan ) and (present-day) Iran. [84] It was “a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements”, [84] which borrowed “distinctive religious beliefs and practices” [83] from the Bactria–Margiana Culture . [83] At least 383 non-Indo-European words were borrowed from this culture, including the god Indra and the ritual drink Soma . [85] According to Anthony,\nMany of the qualities of Indo-Iranian god of might/victory, Verethraghna , were transferred to the adopted god Indra, who became the central deity of the developing Old Indic culture. Indra was the subject of 250 hymns, a quarter of the Rig Veda. He was associated more than any other deity with Soma, a stimulant drug (perhaps derived from Ephedra) probably borrowed from the BMAC religion. His rise to prominence was a peculiar trait of the Old Indic speakers. [68]\nThe oldest inscriptions in Old Indic, the language of the Rig Veda, are found not in northwestern India and Pakistan, but in northern Syria, the location of the Mitanni kingdom. [86] The Mitanni kings took Old Indic throne names, and used Old Indic technical terms were used for horse-riding and chariot-driving. [86] The Old Indic term r’ta , meaning “cosmic order and truth”, the central concept of the Rig Veda, was also employed in the mitanni kingdom. [86] And Old Indic gods, including Indra , were also known in the Mitanni kingdom. [87] [88] [89]\nTheir religion was further developed when they migrated into the Ganges Plain after c. 1100 BCE and became settled farmers, [63] [90] [91] further syncretising with the native cultures of northern India. [78] The Vedic religion of the later Vedic period co-existed with local religions, such as the Yaksha cults, [78] [92] [web 5] and was itself the product of “a composite of the indo-Aryan and Harappan cultures and civilizations”. [16] [note 7] David Gordon White cites three other mainstream scholars who “have emphatically demonstrated” that Vedic religion is partially derived from the Indus Valley Civilizations . [93] [note 7] Their religion was further developed when they migrated into the Ganges Plain after c. 1100 BCE and became settled farmers, [63] [90] [91] further syncretising with the native cultures of northern India. [78]\nVedas\nIts liturgy is preserved in the three Vedic Samhitas : the Rig-Veda , Sama-Veda and the Yajur-Veda . The Vedic texts were the texts of the elite, and do not necessarily represent popular ideas or practices. [94] Of these, the Rig-Veda is the oldest, a collection of hymns composed between ca. 1500-1200 BCE. [95] [96] [68] The other two add ceremonial detail for the performance of the actual sacrifice. The Atharva-Veda may also contain compositions dating to before 1000 BCE. It contains material pertinent to domestic ritual and folk magic of the period.\nThese texts, as well as the voluminous commentary on orthopraxy collected in the Brahmanas compiled during the early 1st millennium BCE, were transmitted by oral tradition alone until the advent, in the 4th century AD, of the Pallava and Gupta period and by a combination of written and oral tradition since then.\nThe Hindu samskaras\n…go back to a hoary antiquity. The Vedas, the Brahmanas, the Grhyasutras, the Dharmasutras, the Smritis and other treatises describe the rites, ceremonies and customs. [97]\nThe earliest text of the Vedas is the Rigveda , [98] a collection of poetic hymns used in the sacrificial rites of Vedic priesthood . Many Rigvedic hymns concern the fire ritual ( Agnihotra ) and especially the offering of Soma to the gods ( Somayajna ). Soma is both an intoxicant and a god itself, as is the sacrificial fire, Agni . The royal horse sacrifice ( Ashvamedha ) is a central rite in the Yajurveda .\nThe gods in the Rig-Veda are mostly personified concepts, who fall into two categories: the devas – who were gods of nature – such as the weather deity Indra (who is also the King of the gods), Agni (“fire”), Usha (“dawn”), Surya (“sun”) and Apas (“waters”) on the one hand, and on the other hand the asuras – gods of moral concepts – such as Mitra (“contract”), Aryaman (guardian of guest, friendship and marriage), Bhaga (“share”) or Varuna , the supreme Asura (or Aditya). While Rigvedic deva is variously applied to most gods, including many of the Asuras, the Devas are characterised as Younger Gods while Asuras are the Older Gods (pūrve devāḥ). In later Vedic texts, the Asuras become demons.\nThe Rigveda has 10 Mandalas (‘books’). There is significant variation in the language and style between the family books (RV books 2–7), book 8 , the “Soma Mandala” ( RV 9 ), and the more recent books 1 and 10 . The older books share many aspects of common Indo-Iranian religion, and is an important source for the reconstruction of earlier common Indo-European traditions . Especially RV 8 has striking similarity to the Avesta , [99] containing allusions to Afghan Flora and Fauna, [100] e.g. to camels (úṣṭra- = Avestan uštra). Many of the central religious terms in Vedic Sanskrit have cognates in the religious vocabulary of other Indo-European languages (deva: Latin deus; hotar : Germanic god ; asura: Germanic ansuz ; yajna : Greek hagios; brahman : Norse Bragi or perhaps Latin flamen etc.). Especially notable is the fact, that in the Avesta Asura (Ahura) is known as good and Deva (Daeva) as evil entity, quite the opposite of the RigVeda.\nCosmic order\nEthics in the Vedas are based on the concepts of Satya and Rta . Satya is the principle of integration rooted in the Absolute. [101] Ṛta is the expression of Satya, which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it. [102] Conformity with Ṛta would enable progress whereas its violation would lead to punishment. Panikkar remarks:\nṚta is the ultimate foundation of everything; it is “the supreme”, although this is not to be understood in a static sense. [...] It is the expression of the primordial dynamism that is inherent in everything….” [103]\nThe term “dharma” was already used in Brahmanical thought, where it was conceived as an aspect of Rta . [104] The term rta is also known from the Proto-Indo-Iranian religion , the religion of the Indo-Iranian peoples prior to the earliest Vedic (Indo-Aryan) and Zoroastrian (Iranian) scriptures. Asha (aša) is the Avestan language term corresponding to Vedic language ṛta . [105]\nUpanishads\nThe 9th and 8th centuries BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads. [106] :183 Upanishads form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Veda ). [107] The older Upanishads launched attacks of increasing intensity on the rituals, however, a philosophical and allegorical meaning is also given to these rituals. In some later Upanishads there is a spirit of accommodation towards rituals. The tendency which appears in the philosophical hymns of the Vedas to reduce the number of gods to one principle becomes prominent in the Upanishads. [108] The diverse monistic speculations of the Upanishads were synthesised into a theistic framework by the sacred Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita . [109]\nBrahmanism\nIn Iron Age India , during a period roughly spanning the 10th to 6th centuries BCE, the Mahajanapadas arise from the earlier petty kingdoms of the various Rigvedic tribes , and the failing remnants of the Late Harappan culture. In this period the mantra portions of the Vedas are largely completed, and a flowering industry of Vedic priesthood organised in numerous schools ( shakha ) develops exegetical literature, viz. the Brahmanas . These schools also edited the Vedic mantra portions into fixed recensions, that were to be preserved purely by oral tradition over the following two millennia.\nSecond Urbanisation (c. 600–200 BCE)\nUpanishads and shramana movements\nIncreasing urbanisation of India in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or sramana movements which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals. [110] Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE), proponent of Jainism , and Buddha (c. 563-483), founder of Buddhism , were the most prominent icons of this movement. [106] :184 According to Heinrich Zimmer , Jainism and Buddhism are part of the pre-Vedic heritage, which also includes Samkhya and Yoga:\n[Jainism] does not derive from Brahman-Aryan sources, but reflects the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre-Aryan upper class of northeastern India – being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic metaphysical speculation as Yoga, Sankhya, and Buddhism, the other non-Vedic Indian systems. [111] [note 29]\nThe Sramana tradition in part created the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara , and the concept of liberation, which became characteristic for Hinduism. [note 30]\nPratt notes that Oldenberg (1854-1920), Neumann (1865-1915) and Radhakrishnan (1888-1975) believed that the Buddhist canon had been influenced by Upanishads, while la Vallee Poussin thinks the influence was nihil, and “Eliot and several others insist that on some points the Buddha was directly antithetical to the Upanishads”. [112] [note 31]\nSurvival of Vedic ritual\nVedism as the religious tradition of Hinduism of a priestly elite was marginalised by other traditions such as Jainism and Buddhism in the later Iron Age, but in the Middle Ages would rise to renewed prestige with the Mimamsa school, which as well as all other astika traditions of Hinduism, considered them authorless ( apaurusheyatva ) and eternal. A last surviving elements of the Historical Vedic religion or Vedism is Śrauta tradition, following many major elements of Vedic religion and is prominent in Southern India , with communities in Tamil Nadu , Kerala , Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , but also in some pockets of Uttar Pradesh , Maharashtra and other states; the best known of these groups are the Nambudiri of Kerala, whose traditions were notably documented by Frits Staal . [114] [115] [116]\nMauryan empire\nThe Mauryan period saw an early flowering of classical Sanskrit Sutra and Shastra literature and the scholarly exposition of the “circum-Vedic” fields of the Vedanga . However, during this time Buddhism was patronised by Ashoka , who ruled large parts of India, and Buddhism was also the mainstream religion until the Gupta empire period.\nSanskritization\nSince Vedic times, “people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms”, a process sometimes called Sanskritization . [117] It is reflected in the tendency to identify local deities with the gods of the Sanskrit texts. [117]\nClassical Hinduism (c. 200 BCE-1200 CE)\nPre-classical Hinduism (c. 200 BCE-320 CE)\nHindu synthesis\nBetween 500 [3] -200 [23] BCE and c. 300 CE developed the “Hindu synthesis”, [3] [23] which incorporated Sramanic and Buddhist influences [23] [25] and the emerging bhakti tradition into the Brahmanical fold via the smriti literature. [26] [23] This synthesis emerged under the pressure of the success of Buddhism and Jainism. [27]\nAccording to Embree, several other religious traditions had existed side by side with the Vedic religion. These indigenous religions “eventually found a place under the broad mantle of the Vedic religion”. [118] When Brahmanism was declining [note 32] and had to compete with Buddhism and Jainism, [note 33] the popular religions had the opportunity to assert themselves. [118] According to Embree,\n[T]he Brahmanists themselves seem to have encouraged this development to some extent as a means of meeting the challenge of the heterodox movements. At the same time, among the indigenous religions, a common allegiance to the authority of the Veda provided a thin, but nonetheless significant, thread of unity amid their variety of gods and religious practices. [118]\nSmriti\nAccording to Larson, the Brahmins responded with assimilation and consolidation. This is reflected in the smriti literature which took shape in this period. [119] The smriti texts of the period between 200 BCE-100 CE proclaim the authority of the Vedas , and acceptance of the Vedas became a central criterium for defining Hinduism over and against the heterodoxies, which rejected the Vedas. [120] Most of the basic ideas and practices of classical Hinduism derive from the new smriti literature. [note 34]\nOf the six Hindu darsanas, the Mimamsa and the Vedanta “are rooted primarily in the Vedic sruti tradition and are sometimes called smarta schools in the sense that they develop smarta orthodox current of thoughts that are based, like smriti, directly on sruti. [121] According to Hiltebeitel, “the consolidation of Hinduism takes place under the sign of bhakti“. [121] It is the Bhagavadgita that seals this achievement. [121] The result is an “universal achievement” that may be called smarta . [121] It views Shiva and Vishnu as “complementary in their functions but ontologically identical”. [121]\nThe major Sanskrit epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata , which belong to the smriti, were compiled over a protracted period during the late centuries BCE and the early centuries CE. [web 6] They contain mythological stories about the rulers and wars of ancient India, and are interspersed with religious and philosophical treatises. The later Puranas recount tales about devas and devis , their interactions with humans and their battles against rakshasa . The Bhagavad Gita “seals the achievement” [122] of the “consolidation of Hinduism”, [122] integrating Brahmanic and sramanic ideas with theistic devotion. [122] [123] [124] [web 7]\nSchools of Hindu pholosophy\nIn early centuries CE several schools of Hindu philosophy were formally codified, including Samkhya , Yoga , Nyaya , Vaisheshika , Purva-Mimamsa and Vedanta . [125]\nSangam literature\nThe Sangam literature (300 BCE – 300 CE) is a mostly secular body of classical literature in the Tamil language . Nonetheless there are some works, significantly Pattupathu and Paripaatal, wherein the personal devotion to god was written in form of devotional poems. Vishnu , Shiva and Murugan were mentioned gods. These works are therefore the earliest evidences of monotheistic Bhakti traditions, preceding the large bhakti movement , which was given great attention in later times.\n“Golden Age” (Gupta and Pallava period) (c. 320-650 CE)\nDuring this period, power was centralised, along with a growth of far distance trade, standardization of legal procedures, and general spread of literacy. [126] Mahayana Buddhism flourished, but orthodox Brahmana culture began to be rejuvenated by the patronage of the Gupta Dynasty, [127] who were Vaishnavas. [128] The position of the Brahmans was reinforced, [126] the first Hindu temples dedicated to the gods of the Hindu deities , emerged during the late Gupta age. [126] [note 35] During the Gupta reign the first Puranas were written, [28] [note 8] which were used to disseminate “mainstream religious ideology amongst pre-literate and tribal groups undergoing acculturation.” [28] The Guptas patronised the newly emerging Puranic religion, seeking legitimacy for their dynasty. [128] The resulting Puranic Hinduism, differed markedly from the earlier Brahmanism of the Dharmasastras and the smritis. [28]\nAccording to P.S. Sharma “the Gupta and Harsha periods form really, from the strictly intellectual standpoint, the most brilliant epocha in the development of Indian philosophy”, as Hindu and Buddhist philosophies flourished side by side. [129] Charvaka , the atheistic materialist school, came to the fore in North India before the 8th century CE. [130]\nGupta and Pallava Empires\nThe Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries) saw a flowering of scholarship, the emergence of the classical schools of Hindu philosophy , and of classical Sanskrit literature in general on topics ranging from medicine, veterinary science, mathematics, to astrology and astronomy and astrophysics. The famous Aryabhata and Varahamihira belong to this age. The Gupta established a strong central government which also allowed a degree of local control. Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs. This included a strict caste system, or class system. The peace and prosperity created under Gupta leadership enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors.\nThe Pallavas (4th to 9th centuries) were, alongside the Guptas of the North , patronisers of Sanskrit in the South of the Indian subcontinent . The Pallava reign saw the first Sankrit inscriptions in a script called Grantha . Early Pallavas had different connexions to Southeast Asian countries. The Pallavas used Dravidian architecture to build some very important Hindu temples and academies in Mamallapuram , Kanchipuram and other places; their rule saw the rise of great poets, who are as famous as Kalidasa .\nThe practice of dedicating temples to different deities came into vogue followed by fine artistic temple architecture and sculpture (see Vastu Shastra ).\nBhakti\nThis period saw the emergence of the Bhakti movement . The Bhakti movement was a rapid growth of bhakti beginning in Tamil Nadu in Southern India with the Saiva Nayanars (4th to 10th centuries CE) [131] and the Vaisnava Alvars (3rd to 9th centuries CE) who spread bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India by the 12th to 18th centuries CE. [132] [131]\nExpansion in South-East Asia\nExpansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.\nHindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as first century. [133] At this time, India started to strongly influence Southeast Asian countries. Trade routes linked India with southern Burma , central and southern Siam , lower Cambodia and southern Vietnam and numerous urbanised coastal settlements were established there.\nFor more than a thousand years, Indian Hindu/Buddhist influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The Pali and Sanskrit languages and the Indian script, together with Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism , Brahmanism and Hinduism , were transmitted from direct contact as well as through sacred texts and Indian literature, such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata epics.\nFrom the 5th to the 13th century, South-East Asia had very powerful Indian colonial empires and became extremely active in Hindu and Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The Sri Vijaya Empire to the south and the Khmer Empire to the north competed for influence.\nLangkasuka (-langkha Sanskrit for “resplendent land” -sukkha of “bliss”) was an ancient Hindu kingdom located in the Malay Peninsula . The kingdom, along with Old Kedah settlement, are probably the earliest territorial footholds founded on the Malay Peninsula. According to tradition, the founding of the kingdom happened in the 2nd century; Malay legends claim that Langkasuka was founded at Kedah , and later moved to Pattani .\nFrom the 5th-15th centuries Sri Vijayan empire , a maritime empire centred on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia , had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism under a line of rulers named the Sailendras . The Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the Chola rulers of India. The Majapahit Empire succeeded the Singhasari empire. It was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in Maritime Southeast Asia .\nFunan was a pre- Angkor Cambodian kingdom, located around the Mekong delta, probably established by Mon-Khmer settlers speaking an Austroasiatic language. According to reports by two Chinese envoys, K’ang T’ai and Chu Ying, the state was established by an Indian Brahmin named Kaundinya , who in the 1st century CE was given instruction in a dream to take a magic bow from a temple and defeat a Khmer queen, Soma. Soma, the daughter of the king of the Nagas, married Kaundinya and their lineage became the royal dynasty of Funan. The myth had the advantage of providing the legitimacy of both an Indian Brahmin and the divinity of the cobras, who at that time were held in religious regard by the inhabitants of the region.\nThe kingdom of Champa (or Lin-yi in Chinese records) controlled what is now south and central Vietnam from approximately 192 through 1697. The dominant religion of the Cham people was Hinduism and the culture was heavily influenced by India.\nLater, from the 9th to the 13th century, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu Khmer Empire dominated much of the South-East Asian peninsula. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. Angkor was at the centre of this development, with a temple complex and urban organisation able to support around one million urban dwellers. The largest temple complex of the world, Angkor Wat, stands here; built by the king Vishnuvardhan.\nLate-Classical Hinduism – Puranic Hinduism (c. 650-1200 CE)\nSee also Late-Classical Age .\nAfter the end of the Gupta Empire and the collapse of the Harsha Empire, power became decentralised in India. Several larger kingdoms emerged, with “countless vasal states”. [134] [note 36] The kingdoms were ruled via a feudal system. Smaller kingdoms were dependent on the protection of the larger kingdoms. “The great king was remote, was exalted and deified”, [134] as reflected in the Tantric Mandala , which could also depict the king as the centre of the mandala. [135]\nThe disintegration of central power also lead to regionalisation of religiosity, and religious rivalry. [136] [note 37] Local cults and languages were enhanced, and the influence of “Brahmanic ritualistic Hinduism” [136] was diminished. [136] Rural and devotional movements arose, along with Shaivism , Vaisnavism , Bhakti and Tantra , [136] though “sectarian groupings were only at the beginning of their development”. [136] Religious movements had to compete for recognition by the local lords. [136] Buddhism lost its position after the 8th century, and began to disappear in India. [136] This was reflected in the change of puja-ceremonies at the courts in the 8th century, where Hindu gods replaced the Buddha as the “supreme, imperial deity”. [note 38]\nPuranic Hinduism\nThe Brahmanism of the Dharmashastras and the smritis underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of Puranic Hinduism, [28] “which like a colossus striding across the religious firmanent soon came to overshadow all existing religions”. [137] Puranic Hinduism was a “multiplex belief-system which grew and expanded as it absorbed and synthesised polaristic ideas and cultic traditions” [137] It was distinguished from its Vedic Smarta roots by its popular base, its theological and sectarioan pluralism, its Tantric veneer, and the central place of bhakti. [137] [note 9]\nThe early mediaeval Puranas were composed to disseminate religious mainstream ideology among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation . [28] With the breakdown of the Gupta empire, gifts of virgin waste-land were heaped on brahmanas, [33] [138] to ensure provitable agrarical exploitation of land owned by the kings, [33] but also to provide status to the new ruling classes. [33] Brahmanas spread further over India, interacting with local clans with different religions and ideologies. [33] The Brahmanas used the Puranas to incorporate those clans into the agrarical society and its accompanying religion and ideology. [33] According to Flood, “[t]he Brahmans who followed the puranic religion became known as smarta , those whose worship was based on the smriti, or pauranika , those based on the Puranas.” [139] Local chiefs and peasants were absorbed into the varna , which was used to keep “control over the new kshatriyas and shudras.” [140] The Brahmanic group was enlarged by incorporating local subgroups, such as local priets. [33] This also lead to a stratification within the Brahmins, with some Brahmins having a lower status than other Brahmins. [33] The use of caste worked better with the new Puranic Hinduism than with the sramanic sects. [140] The Puranic texts provided extensive genealogies which gave status to the new kshatriyas. [140] Buddhist myths pictured government as a contract between an elected ruler and the people. [140] And the Buddhist chakkavatti [note 39] “was a distinct concept from the models of conquest held up to the kshatriyas and the Rajputs.” [140]\nMany local religions and traditions were assimilated into puranic Hinduism. Vishnu and Shiva emerged as the main deities, together with Sakti/Deva. [141] Vishnu subsumed the cults of Narayana , Jagannaths , Venkateswara “and many others”. [141] Nath:\n[S]ome incarnations of Vishnu such as Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and perhaps even Nrsimha helped to incorporate certain popular totem symbols and creation myths, specially those related to wild boar, which commonly permeate preliterate mythology, others such as Krsna and Balarama became instrumental in assimilating local cults and myths centering around two popular pastoral and agricultural gods. [142]\nThe transformation of Brahmanism into Pauranic Hinduism in post- Gupta India was due to a process of acculturation . The Puranas helped establish a religious mainstream among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation. The tenets of Brahmanism and of the Dharmashastras underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of a mainstream “Hinduism” that overshadowed all earlier traditions. [33]\nBhakti movement\nRama and Krsna became the focus of a strong bhakti tradition, which found expression particularly in the Bhagavata Purana . The Krsna tradition subsumed numerous Naga, yaksa and hill and tree based cults. [143] Siva absorbed local cults by the suffixing of Isa or Isvara to the name of the local deity, for example Bhutesvara, Hatakesvara, Chandesvara. [141] In 8th-century royal circles, the Buddha started to be replaced by Hindu gods in pujas. [note 40] This also was the same period of time the Buddha was made into an avatar of Vishnu. [145]\nThe first documented bhakti movement was founded by Karaikkal-ammaiyar . She wrote poems in Tamil about her love for Shiva and probably lived around the 6th century CE. The twelve Alvars who were Vaishnavite devotees and the sixty-three Nayanars who were Shaivite devotees nurtured the incipient bhakti movement in Tamil Nadu .\nDuring the 12th century CE in Karnataka, the Bhakti movement took the form of the Virashaiva movement. It was inspired by Basavanna , a Hindu reformer who created the sect of Lingayats or Shiva bhaktas. During this time, a unique and native form of Kannada literature-poetry called Vachanas was born.\nAdvaita Vedanta\nShankara (8th century CE) is regarded as the greatest exponent of Advaita Vedanta. Shankara himself, and his grand-teacher Gaudapada , were influenced by Buddhism. [146] [147] [148] [149] Gaudapda took over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (vijñapti-mātra) [150] and “that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation”. [150] Gaudapada “wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the Mandukya Upanishad , which was further developed by Shankara”. [147] Gaudapada also took over the Buddhist concept of “ajāta” from Nagarjuna’s Madhyamaka philosophy. [148] [149] Shankara succeeded in reading Gaudapada’s mayavada [151] [note 41] into Badarayana’s Brahma Sutras, “and give it a locus classicus“, [151] against the realistic strain of the Brahma Sutras. [151]\nShankara is the founder of the Dashanami Sampradaya of Hindu monasticism and Shanmata tradition of worship. Shankara is also regarded as the greatest teacher [152] and reformer of the Smartha Tradition . [153] [152] According to Hinduism-guide.com:\nNot all Brahmins specialized in this Smriti tradition. Some were influenced by Buddhism, Jainism or Charvaka tradition and philosophy. This did not mean that all these people rejected the authority of Vedas, but only that their tradition of worship and philosophy was based not on smriti texts. In time, Shankaracharya brought all the Vedic communities together. He tried to remove the non-smriti aspects that had crept into the Hindu communities. He also endeavoured to unite them by arguing that any of the different Hindu gods could be worshipped, according to the prescriptions given in the smriti texts. He established that worship of various deities are compatible with Vedas and is not contradictory, since all are different manifestations of one nirguna Brahman . Shankaracharya was instrumental in reviving interest in the smritis. [web 12]\nIn modern times, due to the influence of western Orientalism and Perennialism on Indian Neo-Vedanta and Hindu nationalism , [113] Advaita Vedanta has acquired a broad acceptance in Indian culture and beyond as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality. [113]\nContact with Persia and Mesopotamia\nHindu and also Buddhist religious and secular learning had first reached Persia in an organised manner in the 6th century, when the Sassanid Emperor Khosrau I (531–579) deputed Borzuya the physician as his envoy, to invite Indian and Chinese scholars to the Academy of Gundishapur . Burzoe had translated the Sanskrit Panchatantra . His Pahlavi version was translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Moqaffa under the title of Kalila and Dimna or The Fables of Bidpai. [154]\nUnder the Abbasid caliphate, Baghdad had replaced Gundishapur as the most important centre of learning in the then vast Islamic Empire , wherein the traditions as well as scholars of the latter flourished. Hindu scholars were invited to the conferences on sciences and mathematics held in Baghdad. [155]\nMedieval and Early Modern Periods (c. 1200-1850 CE)\nMuslim rule\nBabur visits a Hindu temple.\nThough Islam came to Indian subcontinent in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders, it started impacting Indian religions after the 10th century, and particularly after the 12th century with the establishment and then expansion of Islamic rule . [156] [157] Will Durant calls the Muslim conquest of India “probably the bloodiest story in history”. [158] During this period, Buddhism declined rapidly while Hinduism faced military-led and Sultanates-sponsored religious violence. [158] [159] There was a widespread practice of raids, seizure and enslavement of families of Hindus, who were then sold in Sultanate cities or exported to Central Asia. [160] [161] Some texts suggest a number of Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam. [162] [163] Starting with 13th century, for a period of some 500 years, very few texts, from the numerous written by Muslim court historians, mention any “voluntary conversions of Hindus to Islam”, suggesting its insignificance and perhaps rarity of such conversions. [163] Typically enslaved Hindus converted to Islam to gain their freedom. [164] There were occasional exceptions to religious violence against Hinduism. Akbar , for example, recognized Hinduism, banned enslavement of the families of Hindu war captives, protected Hindu temples, and abolished discriminatory Jizya (head taxes) against Hindus. [160] [165] However, many Muslim rulers of Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire , before and after Akbar, from 12th century to 18th century, destroyed Hindu temples [web 13] [166] [web 14] [note 42] and persecuted non-Muslims .\nUnifying Hinduism\nHinduism underwent profound changes, aided in part by teachers such as Ramanuja , Madhva , and Chaitanya . [156] Followers of the Bhakti movement moved away from the abstract concept of Brahman , which the philosopher Adi Shankara consolidated a few centuries before, with emotional, passionate devotion towards the more accessible Avatars , especially Krishna and Rama. [167] According to Nicholson, already between the 12th and the 16th century, “certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the “six systems” (saddarsana) of mainstream Hindu philosophy.” [168] [note 43] Michaels notes that a historicization emerged which preceded later nationalism, articulating ideas which glorified Hinduism and the past. [169]\nEarly Modern period (c. 1500-1850 CE)\nThe fall of Vijayanagar Empire to Muslim rulers had marked the end of Hindu imperial assertions in the Deccan . But, taking advantage of an over-stretched Mughal Empire (1526–1857), Hinduism once again rose to political prestige, under the Maratha Empire , from 1674 to 1818.\nMughal Empire\nThe Mughal Empire\nAfter the conquest of Persia by the Mongol Empire , a regional Turko-Persio-Mongol dynasty formed. Just as eastern Mongol dynasties inter-married with locals and adopted the local religion of Buddhism and the Chinese culture , this group adopted the local religion of Islam and the Persian culture ; their descendants ruled in India as Mughals .\nThe official State religion of the Mughal Empire was Islam , with the preference to the jurisprudence of the Hanafi Madhhab (Mazhab). Hinduism remained under strain during Babur and Humanyun’s reigns. Sher Shah Suri, the Afghan ruler of North India was comparatively non-repressive. Hinduism came to fore during the three-year rule of Hindu king ‘ Hemu ‘ during 1553-56 when he had defeated Akbar at Agra and Delhi and had taken up the reign from Delhi as a Hindu ‘Vikramaditya’ king after his ‘Rajyabhishake’ or coronation at ‘ Purana Quila ‘ in Delhi. However, during Mughal history, at times, subjects had freedom to practise any religion of their choice, though Non-Muslim able-bodied adult males with income were obliged to pay the Jizya (poll-tax to be spent by the State only on protection of non-Muslims), which signified their status as Dhimmis (responsibility of the State, in regard to safety of life and property).\nPhotograph of the Surya Temple, The most impressive and grandest ruins in Kashmir, at Marttand-Hardy Cole’s Archaeological Survey of India Report ‘Illustrations of Ancient Buildings in Kashmir.’ (1869)\nAkbar , the Mughal emperor Humayun ‘s son and heir from his Sindhi queen Hameeda Banu Begum, had a broad vision of Indian and Islamic traditions. One of Emperor Akbar ‘s most unusual ideas regarding religion was Din-i-Ilahi (Faith of God), which was an eclectic mix of Islam , Zoroastrianism , Hinduism, Jainism and Christianity . It was proclaimed the state religion until his death. These actions however met with stiff opposition from the Muslim clergy, especially the Sufi Shaykh Alf Sani Ahmad Sirhindi . Akbar’s abolition of poll-tax on non-Muslims, acceptance of ideas from other religious philosophies, toleration of public worship by all religions and his interest in other faiths showed an attitude of considerable religious tolerance, which, in the minds of his orthodox Muslim opponents, were tantamount to apostasy .\nAkbar’s son, Jahangir , half Rajput, was also a religious moderate, his mother being Hindu. The influence of his two Hindu queens (the Maharani Maanbai and Maharani Jagat) kept religious moderation as a centre-piece of state policy which was extended under his son, Emperor Shah Jahan , who was by blood 75% Rajput and less than 25% Moghul .\nReligious orthodoxy would only play an important role during the reign of Shah Jahan’s son and successor, Aurangzeb , a devout Sunni Muslim. Aurangzeb was comparatively less tolerant of other faiths than his predecessors had been, and his reign saw an increase in the number and importance of Islamic institutions and scholars. He led many military campaigns against the remaining non-Muslim powers of the Indian subcontinent – the Sikh states of the Punjab, the last independent Hindu Rajputs and the Maratha rebels – as also against the Shia Muslim kingdoms of the Deccan . He also virtually stamped out, from his empire, open proselytisation of Hindus and Muslims by foreign Christian Missionaries , who remained successfully active, however, in the adjoining regions: the present day Kerala , Tamil Nadu and Goa .\nMaratha Empire\nThe last Hindu empire of India – The Maratha Empire in 1760.\nThe Hindu Marathas long had lived in the Desh region around Satara , in the western portion of the Deccan plateau, where the plateau meets the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats mountains. They had resisted incursions into the region by the Muslim Mughal rulers of northern India. Under their ambitious leader Shivaji , the Maratha freed themselves from the Muslim sultans of Bijapur to the southeast and, becoming much more aggressive, began to frequently raid Mughal territory, eventually sacking the wealthy Mughal port of Surat in 1664. After substantial territorial gains, Shivaji was proclaimed ‘Chhatrapati’ (Emperor) in 1674; the Marathas had spread and conquered much of central India by Shivaji’s death in 1680. Subsequently, under the able leadership of Brahmin prime ministers ( Peshwas ), the Maratha Empire reached its zenith; Pune , the seat of Peshwas, flowered as a centre of Hindu learning and traditions. The empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu [170] in the south, to Peshawar (modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan [171] [note 44] ) in the north, and Bengal and Andaman Islands in the east. [173] In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat to Ahmad Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire which halted their imperial expansion into Afghanistan . Ten years after Panipat, the young Peshwa Madhavrao I ‘s Maratha Resurrection reinstated Maratha authority over North India .\nIn 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat to Ahmad Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire which halted their imperial expansion into Afghanistan . Ten years after Panipat, the Peshwa Madhavrao I ‘s Maratha Resurrection reinstated Maratha authority over North India . In a bid to effectively manage the large empire, he gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the knights, which created a confederacy of Maratha states. They became known as the Gaekwads of Baroda , the Holkars of Indore and Malwa , the Scindias of Gwalior and Ujjain , the Bhonsales of the Nagpur and the Puars of Dhar & Dewas . In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune , which became the First Anglo-Maratha War . The Marathas remained the preeminent power in India until their defeat in the Second Anglo-Maratha War which left the East India Company in control of most of India.\nEarly colonialism\nPortuguese missionaries had reached the Malabar Coast in the late 15th century, made contact with the St Thomas Christians in Kerala and sought to introduce the Latin Rite among them. Since the priests for St Thomas Christians were served by the Eastern Christian Churches , they were following Eastern Christian practices at that time. Throughout this period, foreign missionaries also made many new converts to Christianity. This led to the formation of the Latin Catholics in Kerala.\nThe Goa Inquisition was the office of the Christian Inquisition acting in the Indian city of Goa and the rest of the Portuguese empire in Asia. St. Francis Xavier , in a 1545 letter to John III , requested for an Inquisition to be installed in Goa. It was installed eight years after the death of Francis Xavier in 1552. Established in 1560 and operating until 1774, this highly controversial institution was aimed primarily at Hindus and wayward new converts.\nIn the century from 1760 to 1860, India was once more divided into numerous petty and unstable kingdoms, gradually coming under the paramountcy the British Empire : the “lesser Mughals”, the Kingdom of Mysore , Hyderabad State , Maratha Confederacy , Rajput Kingdoms , Palaiyakkarar states, North-Eastern states such as Kingdom of Manipur , Himalayan states, etc. From 1799 to 1849 the only major stable kingdom in India was the Sikh Empire , although it had a syncretic character with a large number of Hindu and Muslim subjects living in peace. It too became unstable after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh . The entire subcontinent fell under British rule (partly indirectly , via princely states ) following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 .\nModern Hinduism (after c. 1850 CE)\nWith the onset of the British Raj , the colonization of India by the British, there also started a Hindu renaissance in the 19th century, which profoundly changed the understanding of Hinduism in both India and the west. [174] Indology as an academic discipline of studying Indian culture from a European perspective was established in the 19th century, led by scholars such as Max Müller and John Woodroffe . They brought Vedic , Puranic and Tantric literature and philosophy to Europe and the United States. Western orientalist searched for the “essence” of the Indian religions, discerning this in the Vedas, [175] and meanwhile creating the notion of “Hinduism” as a unified body of religious praxis [176] and the popular picture of ‘mystical India’. [176] [174] This idea of a Vedic essence was taken over by Hindu reform movements as the Brahmo Samaj , which was supported for a while by the Unitarian Church , [177] together with the ideas of Universalism and Perennialism , the idea that all religions share a common mystic ground. [178] This “Hindu modernism” , with proponents like Vivekananda , Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan , became central in the popular understanding of Hinduism. [179] [180] [181] [182] [113]\nHindu revivalism\n1909 Prevailing Religions, Map of British Indian Empire, 1909, showing the prevailing majority religions of the population for different districts.\nDuring the 19th century, Hinduism developed a large number of new religious movements , partly inspired by the European Romanticism , nationalism , scientific racism and esotericism ( Theosophy ) popular at the time (while conversely and contemporaneously, India had a similar effect on European culture with Orientalism , “ Hindoo style ” architecture, reception of Buddhism in the West and similar).\nThese reform movements are summarised under Hindu revivalism and continue into the present.\nSahajanand Swami establishes the Swaminarayan Sampraday sect around 1800.\nBrahmo Samaj is a social and religious movement founded in Kolkata in 1828 by Raja Ram Mohan Roy . He was one of the first Indians to visit Europe and was influenced by western thought. He died in Bristol , England. The Brahmo Samaj movement thereafter resulted in the Brahmo religion in 1850 founded by Debendranath Tagore — better known as the father of Rabindranath Tagore .\nSri Ramakrishna and his pupil Swami Vivekananda led a reform in Hinduism in the late 19th century. Their ideals and sayings have inspired numerous Indians as well as non-Indians, Hindus as well as non-Hindus. Among the prominent figures whose ideals were very much influenced by them were Rabindranath Tagore , Gandhi , Subhas Bose , Satyendranath Bose , Megh Nad Saha , and Sister Nivedita .\nArya Samaj (“Society of Nobles “) is a Hindu reform movement in India that was founded by Swami Dayananda in 1875. He was a sannyasin (renouncer) who believed in the infallible authority of the Vedas . Dayananda advocated the doctrine of karma and reincarnation , and emphasised the ideals of brahmacharya ( chastity ) and sanyasa ( renunciation ). Dayananda claimed to be rejecting all non-Vedic beliefs altogether. Hence the Arya Samaj unequivocally condemned idolatry , animal sacrifices , ancestor worship , pilgrimages , priestcraft, offerings made in temples , the caste system, untouchability and child marriages , on the grounds that all these lacked Vedic sanction. It aimed to be a universal church based on the authority of the Vedas . Dayananda stated that he wanted ‘to make the whole world Aryan’, i.e. he wanted to develop missionary Hinduism based on the universality of the Vedas. To this end, the Arya Samaj started Shuddhi movement in the early 20th century to bring back to Hinduism people converted to Islam and Christianity , set up schools and missionary organisations, and extended its activities outside India. It now has branches around the world and has a disproportional number of adherents among people of Indian ancestry in Suriname and the Netherlands, in comparison with India.\nReception in the West\nAn important development during the British colonial period was the influence Hindu traditions began to form on Western thought and new religious movements . An early champion of Indian-inspired thought in the West was Arthur Schopenhauer who in the 1850s advocated ethics based on an “Aryan-Vedic theme of spiritual self-conquest”, as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism of the superficially this-worldly “Jewish” spirit. [183] Helena Blavatsky moved to India in 1879, and her Theosophical Society , founded in New York in 1875, evolved into a peculiar mixture of Western occultism and Hindu mysticism over the last years of her life.\nThe sojourn of Vivekananda to the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 had a lasting effect. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission , a Hindu missionary organisation still active today.\nIn the early 20th century, Western occultists influenced by Hinduism include Maximiani Portaz – an advocate of “Aryan Paganism” – who styled herself Savitri Devi and Jakob Wilhelm Hauer , founder of the German Faith Movement . It was in this period, and until the 1920s, that the swastika became a ubiquitous symbol of good luck in the West before its association with the Nazi Party became dominant in the 1930s.\nHinduism-inspired elements in Theosophy were also inherited by the spin-off movements of Ariosophy and Anthroposophy and ultimately contributed to the renewed New Age boom of the 1960s to 1980s, the term New Age itself deriving from Blavatsky’s 1888 The Secret Doctrine .\nInfluential 20th-century Hindus were Ramana Maharshi , B.K.S. Iyengar , Paramahansa Yogananda , Prabhupada (founder of ISKCON ), Sri Chinmoy , Swami Rama and others who translated, reformulated and presented Hinduism’s foundational texts for contemporary audiences in new iterations, raising the profiles of Yoga and Vedanta in the West and attracting followers and attention in India and abroad.\nContemporary Hinduism\nAs of 2007, of an estimated 944 million Hindus, 98.5% live in South Asia. Of the remaining 1.5% or 14 million, 6 million live in Southeast Asia (mostly Indonesia ), 2 million in Europe, 1.8 million in North America, 1.2 million in Southern Africa .\nSouth Asia\nModern Hinduism is the reflection of continuity and progressive changes that occurred in various traditions and institutions of Hinduism during the 19th and 20th centuries. Its main divisions are into Vaishnavism (largely influenced by Bhakti ), Shaivism , Shaktism and Smartism ( Advaita Vedanta ).\nBesides these traditional denominations, movements of Hindu revivalism look to founders such as Swami Vivekananda , Swami Dayananda ( Arya Samaj ), Rabindranath Tagore , Ramana Maharshi , Aurobindo , Shriram Sharma Acharya , Swami Sivananda , Swami Rama Tirtha , Narayana Guru , Paramhansa Yogananda , Swami Chinmayananda , Shrii Shrii Anandamurti , Pandurang Shastri Athavale ( Swadhyay Movement ) and others.\nThe Hindutva movement advocating Hindu nationalism originated in the 1920s and has remained a strong political force in India. The major party of the religious right, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), since its foundation in 1980 has won several elections, and after a defeat in 2004 remained the leading force of opposition against the coalition government of the Congress Party . The last national general election, held in early 2014, saw a dramatic victory of BJP; it gained an absolute majority and formed the government, with Narendra Modi as Prime Minister .\nSoutheast Asia\nThe resurgence of Hinduism in Indonesia is occurring in all parts of the country. In the early seventies, the Toraja people of Sulawesi were the first to be identified under the umbrella of ‘Hinduism’, followed by the Karo Batak of Sumatra in 1977 and the Ngaju Dayak of Kalimantan in 1980.\nThe growth of Hinduism has been driven also by the famous Javanese prophesies of Sabdapalon and Jayabaya . Many recent converts to Hinduism had been members of the families of Sukarno ‘s PNI, and now support Megawati Sukarnoputri . This return to the ‘religion of Majapahit ‘ (Hinduism) is a matter of nationalist pride.\nThe new Hindu communities in Java tend to be concentrated around recently built temples (pura) or around archaeological temple sites (candi) which are being reclaimed as places of Hindu worship. An important new Hindu temple in eastern Java is Pura Mandaragiri Sumeru Agung, located on the slope of Mt. Semeru , Java’s highest mountain. Mass conversions have also occurred in the region around Pura Agung Blambangan, another new temple, built on a site with minor archaeological remnants attributed to the kingdom of Blambangan , the last Hindu polity on Java, and Pura Loka Moksa Jayabaya (in the village of Menang near Kediri).\nNeo-Hindu movements in the west\nIn modern times Smarta-views have been highly influential in both the Indian [web 15] and western [web 16] understanding of Hinduism via Neo-Vedanta . Vivekananda was an advocate of Smarta-views, [web 16] and Radhakrishnan was himself a Smarta-Brahman. [184] [185] According to iskcon.org,\nMany Hindus may not strictly identify themselves as Smartas but, by adhering to Advaita Vedanta as a foundation for non-sectarianism, are indirect followers. [web 15]\nInfluential in spreading Hinduism to a western audience were Swami Vivekananda , A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada ( Hare Krishna movement ), Sri Aurobindo , Meher Baba , Osho , Maharishi Mahesh Yogi ( Transcendental Meditation ), Jiddu Krishnamurti , Sathya Sai Baba , Mother Meera , among others.\nHindutva\nIn the 20th century, Hinduism also gained prominence as a political force and a source for national identity in India. With origins traced back to the establishment of the Hindu Mahasabha in the 1910s, the movement grew with the formulation and development of the Hindutva ideology in the following decades; the establishment of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925; and the entry, and later success, of RSS offshoots Jana Sangha and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in electoral politics in post-independence India. [186] Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement. [187] [note 45] [note 46]\nSee also\n^ The term “mayavada” is still being used, in a critical way, by the Hare Krshnas.

In this process the rude, barbaric Aryan tribes were gradually civilised and eventually merged with the autochthonous Dravidians. Although elements of their domestic cult and ritualism were jealously preserved by Brahman priests, the body of their culture survived only in fragmentary tales and allegories embedded in vast, syncretistic compendia. On the whole, the Aryan contribution to Indian culture is insignificant. The essential pattern of Indian culture was already established in the third millennium B.C., and … the form of Indian civilization perdured and eventually reasserted itself ( Sjoberg 1990 , p. 43).\n^ Hopfe & Woodward (2008 , p. 79): “The religion that the Aryans brought with them mingled with the religion of the native people, and the culture that developed between them became classical Hinduism.”\n^ Smart (2003 , pp. 52, 83–86) distinguishes “Brahmanism” from the Vedic religion, connecting “Brahmanism” with the Upanishads.\nReferences",
                "Development of Monotheism, Karama & Reincarnation\nDevelopment of Monotheism\nKarma and Reincarnation\nin Hinduism\nAs is evident, Vedism was only a nature                worshipping religion. It never had the slightest notion about a                monotheistic Supreme God. In the Vedic days, There were no                temples. The Vedic people would pray in the open sitting around a \"vedi (altar) \" on which fire was lit and this sacrificial ritual                was known as jagna. The Rig-Veda has several verses praising                Indra, the god of rain and thunder and the king of all gods.                Nevertheless, in the Rig-Veda, we never come across words like                Bhagwan or Ishwara.\nHindu scholars argue relently trying to establish                monotheistic concept in the Vedas by quoting the concepts of                Prajapati, Dharr and Tatr. The hymns often cited are purusha-sukta                (X-90), nasadiya sukta (X-129) and a few others. These are really                post- Christian writings. Monotheistic concepts are either                interpolations or were developed late in the Christian era.\nMonistic tendencies within the Indo-European                religion came out of its contact with Jewish religion during the                period of Nebuchadnezer. In India it came through the ministy of                St.Thomas.\nHere is the quote on the monotheism in Vedic                religion:\n\"Already the Rigveda, in its youngest books (books 1 and 10)                contains evidence for emerging monistic thought. Often quoted are                pada 1.164.46c,\nï¿½kam sï¿½d vï¿½pr\nāï¿½                    bahudhāï¿½                    vadanti\n\"To what is One, sages give many a title\" (trans. Griffith)\nand hymns 10.129 and 10.130, dealing with a                creator deity, especially verse 10.129.7:\niyï¿½m vï¿½s\nṛṣṭiḥ yï¿½taḥ ābabhï¿½va / yï¿½di vā dadhï¿½ yï¿½di vā nï¿½ / yï¿½ḥ asya ï¿½dhyakṣaḥ paramï¿½ vyï¿½man / sï¿½ḥ aṅgï¿½                    veda yï¿½di vā nï¿½ vï¿½da\n\"He, the first origin of this creation,                    whether he formed it all or did not form it, / Whose eye                    controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or                    perhaps he knows not.\" (trans. Griffith)\nï¿½kam sï¿½t\nin 1.164.46c means \"One Being\" or \"One Truth\". Such concepts received greater emphasis in classical                Hinduism, from the time of Adi Shankara at the latest.\"\nAll these references are from the youngest of the                book which were written duirng the Post Christian period.\nThese Vedic gods have brought about a question                that you may find pertinent. In the tenth book of Rig Veda, hymn                121, you may read: \"What God shall we adore . . .?\" It is                repeated eight times. The answer concludes the poem: \"The Creator                of Heaven and Earth\", also called \"Lord of creatures\". Evidently                this later addition of Rig Veda must have been taken from the                early Christian writings. Other interpolations include the ideas                of Purusha (the cosmic man), sat (existence), asat                (non-existence), kama (desire) as the first seed of mind. These                were essentially the concepts expressed in Sankhya philosophy.\nRig Veda does not mention even in passing the                Supreme God concept such as, Isvar, Isam, Paramatma, Parmeshwar,                Prabhu, Maheshwar, and Bhagavan anywhere. From these, it is                evident that the concept of one supreme God did not exist prior to                the advent of St.Thomas. It came as a new concept and was adopted                by the Indian priestly class to revive their almost lost religious                authority.\nWhen and why did monotheism come in India?\n[The following detailed study is based on the paper Monotheism in                Sonatan Dharma - Hinduism - By Indrajit Ganguli.\nRefer also to Ganguliï¿½s book The Gita as It Was: Rediscovering the                Original Bhagavadgita by Phulgenda Sinha)]\nThere is six recognized schools of thought in                ancient India. Four of them Sankhya Darshan (Kapila 700 BC, Yoga (Patanjali                400 BC), Nyaya (Buddha 300 BC), Vaisesika, were rational                philosophies. Mimansa, and Vedanta were introduced in Upanishads.                Next is Charvaka's Lokayatta (Materialism) and his period is dated                around 550 B.C. During the period in question, from 5th century                B.C. up to 8th century A.D., there was decline in Brahmanism and                the new religions of Buddhism and Jainism were well established.                Christianity came in with St.Thomas in AD 52 and Islamic invasion                took place around 6th c AD. Vedism coexisted with all                these other religions which became powerful and Brahmins lost                their position and power.\nHinduism as we know today came with Shankara                    of Kerala. Shankara, was born in Kerala in 788 A.D. Where did                    Shankara get this idea? Shankara was born on the Malabar                    Coast, where the Christians missionaries and the Jewish                    community had been active for centuries. Further, the agents                    of Islam, the Arabs had also penetrated the Malabar coastal                    area decades before the religious training of Shankara had                    begun. Thus, by the time Shankara was mastering the religious                    philosophy, concepts and practices of Hinduism from his Guru                    Gobinda, three versions of monotheism - Judaism, Christianity,                    and Islam - were quite familiar to the intellectuals and                    religious men of this area. According to historian R.C.                    Majumdar, \"Sankara's monism was based upon Islamic creed which                    he had learnt from the forefathers of the Moplas, Navayats and                    Labbes of South India.\"\n \n\"According to the                tenets of Hinduism, God is one as well as many.\" (HinduWebsite.com)\n\"Hindus believe in monotheistic polytheism, rather than                polytheism.\" ( The                Hindu Universe )\n\"Even though Hinduism is mistakenly regarded by many as a religion                having many gods namely, polytheism, yet truly speaking Hinduism                is a monotheistic religion.\" (Sri Swami Chidanda)\n  From 2nd century AD onwards several powerful movements emerged which                emphasized various sectarian deities which gave birth to                devotionalism, or bhaktism as it is known, whereby the worshipper                enters into relationship with a personal God (Bhagavan) or                personal goddess (Bhagavati). \nOnly a Smartha, or follower of the Advaita                philosophy, would have no problem worshiping every imaginable                deity with equal veneration; he views these different deities as                being manifestations of the same God. You donï¿½t need to call it                God, because that is the only reality. Everything else is an                illusion or dream of that conscious being. In the twentieth                century Hindu religion in the west is identified with the Smartha.\nOther Hindu sects, such as Vaishnavism and                Shaivism conform more closely to a Western understanding of what a monotheistic faith is. Vaishnavites considers Vishnu as being the                one and only true God. But there is a blurring of the oneness with                the concept of avatars ï¿½ the incarnations. According to Vaishnava                doctrine, there are two type of avatars ï¿½ Svarupavatars (Purna                avatars of Full Form of Vishnu) and Amsa Rupa avatars ( avatars of                partial form). In the full avatars, the godhead himself incarnates                while in the partial avatars only certain powers are manifested                through certain creatures and persons. The problem is that there                are large number of Full incarnations and an infinite number of                partial incarnations of Vishnu\nTraditionally we are told about the ten                incarnations of Vishnu in which the only complete incarnations are                Narasimha (Lion-Man), Rama and Krishna. All the others are partial                forms. Certain power can be manifested through creatures and                persons and these number in millions. They are sometimes called                Sakty Amsa Avatar (Power Part Incarnation) or Sakty Avesha Avatar.                Here again the masters differ in their opinion who is what. At any                rate the general teaching rallies round the idea that all                incarnations are equally to be worshipped. Major branches of                Vaishnavism include Srivaishnavism, (Ramanuja School) who                advocated Vishishtadvaita (Modified Monism), Dvaita (of Shri                Madhvacharya ï¿½ Dual Nature School) and Gaudiya Vaishnavism (of                Shri Caitanya Mahaprabhu -ISKCON).\nAccording to the Puranas countless numbers of                avatars descend into our universe.\navatara hy                asankhyeya\nive Models                of Existence of God\nSemitic model (Judaism & Islam) :\nGod is One Person and                  there is no other beside Him. God is the creator of both good                  and evil. Every creation is outside of God and is controlled by                  Him.\nGreek model :\nGod is not                  the name of A Person but a common noun. Thus Plato speaks of \"the gods (hoi theoi), or \"the god (ho theos)\", in                  some cases of \"god\", but then in the same way we would talk of \"man\", using the word as a generic name. He also speaks of \"the                  divine (to theion)\".\nAristotle concluded that \"being\" primarily refers to the Unmoved                  Movers, and assigned one of these to each movement in the                  heavens\nVedic Model\nIn popular Indo-European (Greek                  and Vedic) religions the deities are anthropomorphic. This is                  Polytheism, where there is no God who is absolutely supreme or                  above all others. These beings are in constant interactions and                  creates their own hierarchy by virtue of the powers they have                  and powers they acquire and create. This includes Nature gods,                  spirits and beings that depend on matter and non-matter. These                  nature gods can be controlled by sacrifices and presents. They                  do not define good or evil.\nBuddhist Jain Model:\nThere are very many beings in                  the cosmos in different levels of existence and energies. There                  are both beings and non beings ï¿½ Purusha and Prakriti. They are                  in constant flux driven by the laws of existence which are                  immutable\nChristian model :\nChristians believe that the one                  God is Triune (the Holy Trinity). However, this is not a denial                  of monotheism but an affirmation of the complexity of the Divine                  Being. In human terms God is a Community which thinks and act in                  unison by nature. This community of God is an Organism. This is                  a recognition that God cannot be thought of in terms of the                  human dimensions. There are dimensions beyond our comprehension                  which are to be taken into consideration. The Eastern Christian                  Churches proposes the unity of God in that even the creation                  itself is within the dimension of divine, so that all creations                  are part of the divine. But part is not whole in that the                  creation in itself is not God. Thus God is both immanent and                  Transcendant in creation.\nThe various sects of the Hindus has similar theology which are                  monistic as well as henotheistic. Saivism and Vaishanvism are                  examples of this. Vashnavism later expanded an open definition                  which removed the parameters of definition as to what is                  incarnation thus moved towards polytheism. The Smarta model                  removed all the boundaries: Self, The All, is One sheer Being                  present in every part of creation in terms of a manifold of                  impersonal & personal Divine Self-manifestations. Hence every                  part of the cosmos is divine in its fullness. It was                  Shankaracharya in AD 800 who brought this interpretation to                  justify worship of all different gods. He said that any of the                  different Hindu gods could be worshipped, since all are                  different manifestations of Brahman. In fact one can worship                  anything since they are all aspects of god.\nTheo-cosmogenic models\nImmanentism without Tanscendism\n: God and creation are the same. There is no Divine essence                  outside creation, for Divine essence equals Divine existence.\nTranscendentism without Immanentism\n:                  God and creation radically differ. There are two realities                  Prakriti (Creation) and Purusha (Creator)\nGod Immanent and Transcendant\n: God is immanent in creation, but God is more than the                  creation. God existed before the creation. There is a                  distinction between essence and existence. Creation is a                  manifestation of God's Power.\n\"Monotheistic religions are exclusive. They deny                existence of gods of all other religions, unlike polytheists who                believe that there can be more gods than what they themselves                worship, The only time that Monotheists have been seen as tolerant                of other religions is when they are beginning to move from                monotheism to polytheisms and see other gods as reincarnations of                their god to help explain away their ultimate God. \" (http://www.hyperhistory.net/apwh/essays/cot/t0w03monopolytheism.htm)\nFrom Monotheism to Polytheism: Early History of                Mankind\nWhile religions have changed                over the ages Polytheism has de-evolved from Monotheism as mankind                lost contact with the divine. \"Where there is no vision people                perish.\"\nEgypt\nPharaoh Akhenaten and montheistic religion of                Atenism\nThe first mention of                monotheism in history is found in Atenism a religion founded by                Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV), with Sun as Aten the source of all life.                This monotheistic religion did not survive Akhenaten, and the old                Polytheistic religion was restored by his son Tutankhamun. Even                the memory of Akhenaten was wilfully erased from the Pharohnic                history because it was regarded as heresy. It is suggested that                early human history was based on monotheism and it fell into                polytheism in time untill the first Sinaitic revelation when God                himself appeared unto Israel. This was given the final seal with                the incarnation of Jesus into history and his resurrection                establishing his deitihood. Moses learned the basics of monotheism                from Atenism even though Israel was polytheistic during the                slavery period following the Egyptian gods. So Joshua says \"Choose                this day whom you will serve\" Polytheism eventually swallowed                Israel and Judah under the pressence of Indo-European cultures of                Canaan.\nMonotheism and Polytheism\n\"The earliest people that we know of were all                polytheistic: they all worshipped many gods. From 3000 BC to 539                BC, the Sumerians, the Akkadians, the Assyrians and the                Babylonians all worshipped pretty much the same set of gods,                despite their cultural differences. The most important of these                gods was Ea. Ishtar was the most important goddess. Like the Greek                Aphrodite and Demeter, or the Roman Venus and Ceres, or the German                Freya, Ishtar was a fertility goddess.\nThe Phoenicians and Canaanites, further west along                the Mediterranean coast, were also polytheistic, but they had                different gods. Their most important god was Baal, and some                reports say that the Phoenicians and Canaanites sacrificed their                children to him. Their most important goddess was Astarte, another                fertility figure. The Hittites arrived later, around 2500 BC, and                had different gods because they were Indo-Europeans, but they were                polytheistic too.\nThe first signs of monotheism in West Asia come                from the Bible, where by around 1000 BC the Jews seem to have                already thought that they should worship only their own one God.                They clearly believed that there were many gods, but they should                only worship theirs, and in exchange he would take care of them                against all the other gods. They may have gotten this idea from                the Egyptians.\nThe next move toward monotheism comes from                Zoroastrianism, also around 1000 BC. In Zoroastrianism the main                god was Ahura Mazda, and his twin sons represented the Truth and                the Lie; all the minor gods were on either the side of Truth or                the side of the Lie. The most important of these minor gods was                Mithra, who was the god of treaties and contracts, and of                civilization\nWhen the Persian king Cyrus converted to                Zoroastrianism and then conquered a huge empire, many of his                subjects also became Zoroastrians, and the old Sumerian polytheism                more or less died out.\"\nhttp://www.historyforkids.org/learn/westasia/religion/monotheism.htm\nDr. Karen Carr, Associate Professor of History, Portland State                University\n \nDevelopment of of Karma and Reincarnation\nIn the oldest written form of scriptures of Egypt                found in the Book of the Dead, and we see no trace of                reincarnation in it. Instead we have the concept of a life after                death which is determined entirely by what is done in this life.                Egyptians embalmed the dead in order that the body might be                preserved to follow the soul into the next world. This suggests                their belief in resurrection, judgement and rewards and punishment                rather than in reincarnation.\nThe Book of the Dead\nwas used by the ancient                Egyptians as a set of instructions for the afterlife. The Book                of the Dead followed a tradition of Egyptian funerary                literature that dated back as far as the 26th century BC.\nIn these teachings, the deceased soul must recite                the \"declaration of innocence\" which is addressed to Osiris and                consists of the denial of a series of wrong-doings in order to                assure Osiris that he has lived a decent life. The deceased must                then address the 42 judges by name and deny a further 42                transgressions (one per judge). The content of some of the                statements of denial or the 'negative confession' closely resemble                the Ten Commandment of Moses ï¿½ \"I have done no falsehood, I have                not robbed, I have not killed men\". If the deceased is found                worthy he will be taken before Osiris who will lead him to the                realm of the blessed. Each part of his body changes until the dead                is tranformed as a god.\nFailing the scale the unworthy are eaten by the                demoness Ammut (Great of Death, Eater of Hearts, The Devourer) which is the second death. For those who are unrighteous the                life ceases to exist.\nRig Veda the oldest of the Vedas does not contain                the concept of reincarnation as taught by Hinduism today. \"The                soul of the dead is carried up by the fire-god, Agni, who consumes                the material body at cremation, to the heavenly worlds where it                disports itself with the gods in perfect, carefree bliss. There                will be eating and drinking of heavenly food and drink, reunion                with father, mother, wife and sons.\"\nApparently the earliest concept of reincarnation                in its materialistic form was that of Buddhism. Here life                continues ï¿½ not as an identity - but as a cosmic element.\n\"Men have, O young man, deeds as their very own,                they are inheritors of deeds, deeds are their matrix, deeds are                their kith and kin, and deeds are their support. It is deeds that                classify men into high or low status\" (Majjhima Nikaya 135,4).\nIn Buddhism \"only karma is passing from one life                to another, using the illustration of the light of a candle, which                is derived from another candle without having a substance of its                own. In the same manner there is rebirth without the transfer of a                self from one body to another. The only link from one life to the                next is of a causal nature. In the Garland Sutra (10) we                read:\nAccording to what deeds are done\nDo their resulting consequences come to be;\nYet the doer has no existence:\"\nThis is the Buddhaï¿½s teaching.\n\"Classical Buddhist doctrine postulates the                existence of skandhas, which are unrelated psychic \"causes\" that are dissolved upon death and reactivated at birth. However,                this is different from the Hindu concept of an individual soul                reincarnating; it is more impersonal. Each individual is born with                characteristics from a variety of past lives and other karmic                sources, just as an automobile might be assembled from                miscellaneous parts in a junkyard.\" http://www.ccel.us/reincarnation.chap3.html\nIf the cars in the junkyard are all of poor                quality, the resultant rebuild also will be poor. If they are good                in general we will get another good car even from the junkyard.\nJainism is probably the earliest form continuity                of ego as is understood by reincarnation today.\n\"According to Jainism, in addition to matter and energy, space and                time, there are three more entities in the universe: innumerable                individual souls, principle of motion and principle of rest. A                soul is a distinct entity, different from other entities such as                matter, energy, space and time. Further, life of an individual                involves interactions between his/her soul and the environment -                animate as well as inanimate. As long as a worldly being remains                alive, the soul resides in the body and all life-processes go on.                Further, a worldly soul continuously obtains and sheds very fine                particles of matter (karma) on account of its interaction with its                environment. When the living being dies, the soul leaves the body                along with the associated karma particles. All entities of the                universe are eternal. So the soul does not perish upon the death                of a living being. The soul assumes another birth on account of                the karmas in its possession. Thus reincarnation is a natural                consequence of the concept of eternal nature of all entities of                the universe.\" (Reincarnation In Other Religions, Jain Study                Circular: Dr. Chandrakant P. Shah)\nIt is probable that some form of reincarnation                ideas were in existence even before Buddha and Mahavira since they                assumed those ideas as taught by earlier Buddhas and Jain Saints.                Evidently they were proposed as a rational explanation for                inequalities and various forms of life.\nTransmigration was known to early Greek                philosophers of 4th c BC like Socrates, Plato and                Aristotle. They were the rationalist of the period.\nOnly when we come to post Christian hindu                literature can we see the clear elucidation of reincarnation as is                taught today.\n\"We can therefore witness a fundamental shift in the meaning of                afterlife from the Vedic perspective. The Upanishads abandoned the                goal of having communion with the gods (Agni, Indra, etc.),                attained as a result of bringing good sacrifices, and came to                consider manï¿½s final destiny to be the impersonal fusion atman-Brahman,                attained exclusively by esoteric knowledge. In this new context,                karma and reincarnation are key elements that will define all                particular developments in Hinduism.\" http://www.ccel.us/reincarnation.chap3.html",
                "Hinduism | India | Fandom powered by Wikia\nFile:TibetianGanpati.jpg\nHinduism is the predominant religion [3] [4] of the Indian subcontinent , and one of its indigenous religions. Hinduism includes Shaivism , Vaishnavism and Śrauta among numerous other traditions. It also includes historical groups, for example the Kapalikas . Among other practices and philosophies, Hinduism includes a wide spectrum of laws and prescriptions of \"daily morality\" based on the notion of karma , dharma , and societal norms. [5] Hinduism is a conglomeration of distinct intellectual or philosophical points of view, rather than a rigid common set of beliefs. [6]\nHinduism is formed of diverse traditions and has no single founder. [7] Among its direct roots is the  historical Vedic religion of Iron Age India and, as such, Hinduism is often called the \"oldest living religion\" [8] or the \"oldest living major religion\" in the world. [3] [9] [10] [11]\nOne orthodox classification of Hindu texts is to divide into Śruti (\"revealed\") and Smriti (\"remembered\") texts. These texts discuss theology , philosophy , mythology , rituals and temple building among other topics. Major scriptures include the Vedas , Upanishads , Purāṇas , Mahābhārata , Rāmāyaṇa , Bhagavad Gītā and Āgamas .\nHinduism, with about one billion followers, is the world's third largest religion, after Christianity and Islam .\nFile:Valmiki Ramayana.jpg\nThe word Hindu is derived (through Persian) from the Sanskrit word Sindhu, the historic local appellation for the Indus River in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent , which is first mentioned in the Rig Veda . [12] [13] [14]\nThe word Hindu was borrowed into European languages from the Arabic term al-Hind, referring to the land of the people who live across the River Indus, [15] itself from the Persian term Hindū, which refers to all Indians. By the 13th century, Hindustān emerged as a popular alternative name of India , meaning the \"land of Hindus\". [16]\nThe term Hinduism also occurs sporadically in Sanskrit texts such as the later Rajataranginis of Kashmir (Hinduka, c. 1450), some 16th-18th century Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava texts, including Chaitanya Charitamrita and Chaitanya Bhagavata , usually to contrast Hindus with Yavanas or Mlecchas . [17] It was only towards the end of the 18th century that the European merchants and colonists referred collectively to the followers of Indian religions as Hindus. The term Hinduism was introduced into the English language in the 19th century to denote the religious, philosophical, and cultural traditions native to India.\nHistory\nFile:SADF Hindu Chaplain Shoulderboard.jpg\nThe earliest evidence for prehistoric religion in India date back to the late Neolithic in the early Harappan period (5500–2600 BCE). [18] [19] The beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era (1500–500 BCE) are called the \"historical Vedic religion\". The Vedic religion shows influence from Proto-Indo-European religion. [20] [21] [22] [23] The oldest Veda is the Rigveda, dated to 1700–1100 BCE. [24] The Vedas center on worship of deities such as Indra , Varuna and Agni , and on the Soma ritual. Fire-sacrifices, called yajña were performed, and Vedic mantras chanted but no temples or idols are known. [25]\nThe major Sanskrit epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata , were compiled over a protracted period during the late centuries BCE and the early centuries CE. [26] They  contain mythological stories about the rulers and wars of ancient India, and are interspersed with religious and philosophical treatises. The later Puranas recount tales about devas and devis , their interactions with humans and their battles against rakshasa .\nThe Brahmanical tradition was paralleled by the non-Vedic Shramana movement.  The Buddha was a member of this movement. [27] Shramana also gave rise to Jainism , [28] yoga , [29] the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara ,  and the concept of liberation. [30] The Brahmanical ashrama system of life was an attempt to institutionalize Shramana ideals within the Brahmanical social structure. [31] The Shramana movement also influenced the Aranyakas and Upanishads in the Brahmanical tradition. [32] Buddhism was promoted by Asoka the Great of the Mauryan Empire , who unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. After 200 CE several schools of thought were formally codified in Indian philosophy , including Samkhya , Yoga , Nyaya , Vaisheshika , Purva-Mimamsa and Vedanta . [33] Charvaka , the founder of an atheistic materialist school, came to the fore in North India in the sixth century BCE. [34]\nSanskritic culture went into decline after the end of the Gupta period . The early medieval Puranas helped establish a religious mainstream among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation . The tenets of Brahmanic Hinduism and of the Dharmashastras underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of a mainstream \"Hinduism\" that overshadowed all earlier traditions. [35] In eighth century royal circles, the Buddha started to be replaced by Hindu gods in pujas. [36] This also was the same period of time the Buddha was made into an avatar of Vishnu. [37]\nThough Islam came to India in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders and the conquest of Sindh, it started to become a major religion during the later Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent . [34] During this period Buddhism declined rapidly and many Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam . [38] [39] [40] Numerous Muslim rulers or their army generals such as Aurangzeb and Malik Kafur destroyed Hindu temples [41] [42] [43] and persecuted non-Muslims ; however some, such as Akbar , were more tolerant. Hinduism underwent profound changes, in large part due to the influence of the prominent teachers Ramanuja , Madhva , and Chaitanya . [34] Followers of the Bhakti movement moved away from the abstract concept of Brahman , which the philosopher Adi Shankara consolidated a few centuries before, with emotional, passionate devotion towards the more accessible Avatars , especially Krishna and Rama. [44]\nThe oldest Vedic traditions exhibit strong similarities to the pre-Zoroastrian Proto-Indo-Iranian religion and other Indo-European religions. For example, the Ṛgvedic deity Dyaus, regarded as the father of the other deities, is linguistically cognate with Zeus —the king of the gods in Greek mythology , Iovis (gen. of Jupiter) —the king of the gods in Roman mythology , and Tiu/Ziu in Germanic mythology . Other Vedic deities also have cognates with those found in other Indo-European speaking peoples' mythologies; see Proto-Indo-European religion and Comparison of Greek and Hindu Gods. [45]\nIndology as an academic discipline of studying Indian culture from a European perspective was established in the 19th century, led by scholars such as Max Müller and John Woodroffe . They brought Vedic , Puranic and Tantric literature and philosophy to Europe and the United States . At the same time, societies such as the Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society attempted to reconcile and fuse Abrahamic and Dharmic philosophies, endeavouring to institute societal reform. This period saw the emergence of movements which, while highly innovative, were rooted in indigenous tradition. They were based on the personalities and teachings of individuals, as with Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi . Prominent Hindu philosophers, including Aurobindo and Prabhupada (founder of ISKCON ), translated, reformulated and presented Hinduism's foundational texts for contemporary audiences in new iterations, attracting followers and attention in India and abroad. Others such as Vivekananda , Paramahansa Yogananda , B.K.S. Iyengar and Swami Rama have also been instrumental in raising the profiles of Yoga and Vedanta in the West.\nTypology\nFile:New Delhi Temple.jpg\nHinduism as it is commonly known can be subdivided into a number of major currents. Of the historical division into six darsanas , only two schools, Vedanta and Yoga , survive. The main divisions of Hinduism today are Vaishnavism , Shaivism , Smartism and Shaktism . [47] Hinduism also recognizes numerous divine beings subordinate to the Supreme Being or regards them as lower manifestations of it. [48] Other notable characteristics include a belief in reincarnation and karma , as well as in personal duty, or dharma .\nMcDaniel (2007) distinguishes six generic \"types\" of Hinduism, in an attempt to accommodate a variety of views on a rather complex subject: [49]\nFolk Hinduism , as based on local traditions and cults of local deities at a communal level and spanning back to prehistoric times or at least prior to written Vedas .\nŚrauta or \"Vedic\" Hinduism as practiced by traditionalist brahmins ( Śrautins ).\nVedantic Hinduism, for example Advaita Vedanta ( Smartism ), as based on the philosophical approach of the Upanishads .\nFile:NorthIndiaCircuit 250.jpg\nHinduism does not have a \"unified system of belief encoded in declaration of faith or a creed \", [50] but is rather an umbrella term comprising the  plurality of religious phenomena originating and based on the Vedic traditions . [51] [52] [53] [54]\nThe characteristic of comprehensive tolerance to differences in belief, and Hinduism's openness, makes it difficult to define as a religion according to traditional Western conceptions. [55] To its adherents, Hinduism is the traditional way of life, [56] and because of the wide range of traditions and ideas incorporated within or covered by it, arriving at a comprehensive definition of the term is problematic. [50] While sometimes referred to as a religion, Hinduism is more often defined as a religious tradition. [4] It is therefore described as both the oldest of the world's religions, and the most diverse. [3] [57] [58] [59] Most Hindu traditions revere a body of religious or sacred literature , the Vedas , although there are exceptions. Some  Hindu religious traditions regard particular rituals as essential for salvation, but a variety of views on this co-exist. Some Hindu philosophies postulate a theistic ontology of creation, of sustenance, and of destruction of the universe, yet some Hindus are atheists . Hinduism is sometimes characterized by the belief in reincarnation ( samsara ), determined by  the law  of karma , and the idea that salvation is freedom from this cycle of repeated birth and death. However, other religions of the region, such as Buddhism , Jainism and Sikhism , also believe in karma, outside the scope of Hinduism. [50] Hinduism is therefore viewed as the most complex of all of the living, historical world religions. [60] Despite its complexity, Hinduism is not only one of the numerically largest faiths, but is also the oldest living major tradition on earth, with roots reaching back into prehistory. [61]\nA definition of Hinduism, given by the first Vice President of India, who was also a prominent theologian, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , states that Hinduism is not \"just a faith\", but in itself is related to the union of reason and intuition . Radhakrishnan explicitly states that Hinduism cannot be defined, but is only to be experienced. [62] Similarly some academics suggest that Hinduism can be seen as a category with \"fuzzy edges\", rather than as a well-defined and rigid entity. Some forms of religious expression are central to Hinduism, while others are not as central but still remain within the category. Based on this, Ferro-Luzzi has developed a 'Prototype Theory approach' to the definition of Hinduism. [63]\nProblems with the single definition of what is actually meant by the term 'Hinduism' are often attributed to the fact that Hinduism does not have a single or common historical founder. Hinduism, or as some say 'Hinduisms,' does not have a single system of salvation and has different goals according to each sect or denomination. The forms of Vedic religion are seen not as an alternative to Hinduism, but as its earliest form, and there is little justification for the divisions found in much western scholarly writing between Vedism , Brahmanism , and Hinduism. [11] [64]\nA definition of Hinduism is further complicated by the frequent use of  the term \" faith \" as a synonym for \"religion\". [50] Some academics [65] and many practitioners refer to Hinduism using a native definition, as Sanātana Dharma, a Sanskrit phrase meaning  \"the eternal law \", or the \"eternal way\". [66] [67]\nBeliefs\nFile:Halebid3.JPG\nHinduism refers to a religious mainstream which evolved organically and spread over a large territory marked by significant ethnic and cultural diversity. This mainstream evolved both by innovation from within, and by assimilation of  external traditions or cults into the Hindu fold. The result is an enormous variety of religious traditions, ranging from innumerable small, unsophisticated cults to major religious movements with millions of adherents spread over the entire subcontinent. The identification of Hinduism  as an independent religion separate from Buddhism or Jainism consequently hinges on the affirmation of its adherents that it is such. [68]\nHinduism grants absolute and complete freedom of belief and worship . [69] [70] [71] Hinduism conceives the whole world as a single family that deifies the one truth, and therefore it accepts all forms of beliefs and dismisses labels of distinct religions which would imply a division of identity. [72] Hence, Hinduism is devoid of the concepts of apostasy , heresy and blasphemy . [73] [74] [75] [76]\nProminent themes in Hindu beliefs include (but are not restricted to), Dharma (ethics/duties), Samsāra (The continuing cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth), Karma (action and subsequent reaction), Moksha (liberation from samsara), and the various Yogas (paths or practices). [77]\nConcept of God\nMain article: God in Hinduism\ndisplays his Vishvarupa (Universal Form) to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.]]\nHinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning monotheism , polytheism , panentheism , pantheism , monism , and atheism among others; [78] [79] [80] [81] and its concept of God is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition and philosophy followed. It is sometimes referred to as henotheistic (i.e., involving devotion to a single god while accepting the existence of others), but any such term is an overgeneralization. [82]\nThe Rig Veda , the oldest scripture and the mainstay of Hindu philosophy does not take a restrictive view on the fundamental question of God and the creation of universe. It rather lets the individual seek and discover answers in the quest of life. Nasadiya Sukta (Creation   Hymn) of the Rig Veda thus says [83] [84] :\nWho really knows?\nWho will here proclaim it?\nWhence was it produced? Whence is this creation?\nThe gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.\nWho then knows whence it has arisen?\nMost Hindus believe that the spirit or soul — the true \"self\" of every person, called the ātman — is eternal. [85] According to the monistic/pantheistic theologies of Hinduism (such as Advaita Vedanta school), this Atman is ultimately indistinct from Brahman , the supreme spirit. Hence, these schools are called non-dualist . [86] The goal of life, according to the Advaita school, is to realize that one's ātman is identical to Brahman, the supreme soul. [87] The Upanishads state that whoever becomes fully aware of the ātman as the innermost core of one's own self realizes an identity with Brahman and thereby reaches moksha (liberation or freedom). [85] [88]\nThe schools of Vedanta and Nyaya states that karma itself proves the existence of God . [89] [90] Nyaya being the school of logic , makes the \"logical\" inference that the universe is an effect and it ought to have a creator. [91]\nDualistic schools (see Dvaita and Bhakti ) understand Brahman as a Supreme Being who possesses personality, and they worship him or her thus, as Vishnu , Brahma , Shiva , or Shakti , depending upon the sect. The ātman is dependent on God, while moksha depends on love towards God and on God's grace. [92] When God is viewed as the supreme personal being (rather than as the infinite principle), God is called Ishvara (\"The Lord\"), [93] Bhagavan (\"The Auspicious One\" [93] ) or Parameshwara (\"The Supreme Lord\" [93] ). [86] However interpretations of Ishvara vary, ranging from non-belief in Ishvara by followers of Mimamsakas , to identifying Brahman and Ishvara as one, as in Advaita. [86] In the majority of traditions of Vaishnavism he is Vishnu, God, and the text of Vaishnava scriptures identify this Being as Krishna , sometimes referred to as svayam bhagavan . However,under Shaktism , Devi or Adi parashakti is considered as the Supreme Being and in Shaivism Shiva is considered Supreme.\nIn Bhaagawada Gita, for example, God is the sole repository of Gunas (attributes) also, as [94]\nHis hands and feet are everywhere, He looks everywhere and all around, His eyes, ears and face point to all directions, and all the three worlds are surrounded by these.\nAtheistic doctrines dominate Hindu schools like Samkhya and Mimamsa . [95] The Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra of Samkhya argues that the existence of God ( Ishvara ) cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist. [96] Samkhya argue that an unchanging God cannot be the source of an ever changing world. It says God was a necessary metaphysical assumption demanded by circumstances. [97] Proponents of the school of Mimamsa , which is based on rituals and orthopraxy states that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God was insufficient. They argue that there is no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there is no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals. [98] Mimamsa considers the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the mantras that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of Gods. [99]\nDevas and avatars\nFile:Krishna holding flute.jpg\nThe Hindu scriptures refer to celestial entities called Devas (or devī in feminine form; devatā used synonymously for Deva in Hindi), \"the shining ones\", which may be translated into English as \"gods\" or \"heavenly beings\". [100] The devas are an integral part of Hindu culture and are depicted in art , architecture and through icons , and mythological stories about them are related in the scriptures, particularly in Indian epic poetry and the Puranas . They are, however, often distinguished from Ishvara , a supreme personal god, with many Hindus worshiping Ishvara in one of its particular manifestations (ostensibly separate deities) as their iṣṭa devatā , or chosen ideal. [101] [102] The choice is a matter of individual preference, [103] and of regional and family traditions. [103]\nHindu epics and the Puranas relate several episodes of the descent of God to Earth in corporeal form to restore dharma to society and to guide humans to moksha. Such an incarnation is called an Avatar . The most prominent avatars are of Vishnu and include Rama (the protagonist in Ramayana ) and Krishna (a central figure in the epic Mahabharata ).\nKarma and samsara\nMain article: Karma in Hinduism\nKarma translates literally as action, work, or deed, [104] and can be described as the \"moral law of cause and effect\". [105] According to the Upanishads an individual, known as the jiva-atma, develops sanskaras (impressions) from actions, whether physical or mental. The linga sharira, a body more subtle than the physical one but less subtle than the soul, retains impressions, carrying them over into the next life, establishing a unique trajectory for the individual. [106] Thus, the concept of a universal, neutral, and never-failing karma intrinsically relates to reincarnation as well as to one's personality, characteristics, and family. Karma binds together the notions of free will and destiny .\nThis cycle of action, reaction, birth, death and rebirth is a continuum called samsara . The notion of reincarnation and karma is a strong premise in Hindu thought. The Bhagavad Gita states:\nAs a person puts on new clothes and discards old and torn clothes,\nsimilarly an embodied soul enters new material bodies, leaving the old bodies.(B.G. 2:22) [107]\nSamsara provides ephemeral pleasures, which lead people to desire rebirth so as to enjoy the pleasures of a perishable body. However, escaping the world of samsara through moksha is believed to ensure lasting happiness and peace. [108] [109] It is thought that after several reincarnations, an atman eventually seeks unity with the cosmic spirit (Brahman/Paramatman).\nThe ultimate goal of life, referred to as moksha, nirvana or samadhi , is understood in several different ways: as the realization of one's union with God; as the realization of one's eternal relationship with God; realization of the unity of all existence; perfect unselfishness and knowledge of the Self; as the attainment of perfect mental peace; and as detachment from worldly desires. Such realization liberates one from samsara and ends the cycle of rebirth. [110] [111] Due to belief in the indestructibility of the soul, [112] death is deemed insignificant with respect to the cosmic self. [113] Thence, a person who has no desire or ambition left and no responsibilities remaining in life or one affected by a terminal disease may embrace death by Prayopavesa . [114]\nThe exact conceptualization of moksha differs among the various Hindu schools of thought. For example, Advaita Vedanta holds that after attaining moksha an atman no longer identifies itself with an individual but as identical with Brahman in all respects. The followers of Dvaita (dualistic) schools identify themselves as part of Brahman, and after attaining moksha expect to spend eternity in a loka (heaven), [115] in the company of their chosen form of Ishvara. Thus, it is said that the followers of dvaita wish to \"taste sugar\", while the followers of Advaita wish to \"become sugar\". [116]\nObjectives of human life\nClassical Hindu thought accepts the following objectives of human life, that which is sought as human purpose, aim, or end, is known as the puruṣārthas: [117] [118]\nDharma (righteousness, ethikos)\nThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad views dharma as the universal principle of law, order, harmony, all in all truth, that sprang first from Brahman . It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe. It is sat (truth), a major tenet of Hinduism. This hearkens back to the conception of the Rig Veda that \"Ekam Sat,\" (Truth Is One), of the idea that Brahman is \" Sacchidananda \" (Truth-Consciousness-Bliss). Dharma is not just law, or harmony, it is pure Reality. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 's own words:\nVerily, that which is Dharma is truth, Therefore they say of a man who speaks truth, \"He speaks the Dharma,\"\nor of a man who speaks the Dharma, \"He speaks the Truth.\", Verily, both these things are the same.\n—\n(Brh. Upanishad, 1.4.14) ( 2 )\nIn the Mahabharata , Krishna defines dharma as upholding both this-worldly and other-worldly affairs. (Mbh 12.110.11). The word Sanātana means 'eternal', 'perennial', or 'forever'; thus, 'Sanātana Dharma' signifies that it is the dharma that has neither beginning nor end. [119]\nArtha (livelihood, wealth)\nArtha is objective & virtuous pursuit of wealth for livelihood, obligations and economic prosperity. It is inclusive of political life, diplomacy and material well-being. The doctrine of Artha is called Arthashastra , amongst the most famous of which is Kautilya Arthashastra. [120] [121] [122]\nKāma (sensual pleasure)\nKāma ( Sanskrit , Pali ; Devanagari : काम) means desire, wish, passion, longing, pleasure of the senses , the aesthetic enjoyment of life, affection, or love. [123] [124]\nMokṣa (liberation, freedom from samsara)\nMoksha ( Sanskrit : Template:Lang mokṣa) or mukti ( Sanskrit : Template:Lang ), literally \"release\" (both from a root muc \"to let loose, let go\"), is the last goal of life. It is liberation from samsara and the concomitant suffering involved in being subject to the cycle of repeated death and reincarnation . [125]\nYoga\nFile:Shiva Bangalore .jpg\nIn whatever way a Hindu defines the goal of life, there are several methods (yogas) that sages have taught for reaching that goal. Texts dedicated to Yoga include the Bhagavad Gita, the Yoga Sutras , the Hatha Yoga Pradipika , and, as their philosophical and historical basis, the Upanishads. Paths that one can follow to achieve the spiritual goal of life (moksha, samadhi or nirvana ) include:\nBhakti Yoga (the path of love and devotion)\nKarma Yoga (the path of right action)\nJñāna Yoga (the path of wisdom) [126]\nAn individual may prefer one or some yogas over others, according to his or her inclination and understanding. Some devotional schools teach that bhakti is the only practical path to achieve spiritual perfection for most people, based on their belief that the world is currently in the Kali Yuga (one of four epochs which are part of the Yuga cycle). [127] Practice of one yoga does not exclude others. Many schools believe that the different yogas naturally blend into and aid other yogas. For example, the practice of jnana yoga, is thought to inevitably lead to pure love (the goal of bhakti yoga), and vice versa. [128] Someone practicing deep meditation (such as in raja yoga) must embody the core principles of karma yoga, jnana yoga and bhakti yoga, whether directly or indirectly. [126] [129]\nPractices\nFile:Tulasikattesp.jpg\nHindu practices generally involve seeking awareness of God and sometimes also seeking blessings from Devas. Therefore, Hinduism has developed numerous practices meant to help one think of divinity in the midst of everyday life. Hindus can engage in pūjā (worship or veneration), [93] either at home or at a temple. At home, Hindus often create a shrine with icons dedicated to their   chosen form(s) of God. Temples are usually dedicated to a primary deity along with associated subordinate deities though some commemorate multiple deities. Visiting temples is not obligatory, [130] and many visit temples only during religious festivals. Hindus perform their worship through icons ( murtis ). The icon serves as a tangible link between the worshiper and God. [131] The image is often considered a manifestation of God, since God is immanent. The Padma Purana states that the mūrti is not to be thought of as mere stone or wood but as a manifest form of the Divinity. [132] A few Hindu sects, such as the Ārya Samāj , do not believe in worshiping God through icons.\nHinduism has a developed system of symbolism and iconography to represent the sacred in art, architecture, literature and worship. These symbols gain their meaning from the scriptures, mythology, or cultural traditions. The syllable Om (which represents the Parabrahman) and the Swastika sign (which symbolizes auspiciousness) have grown to represent Hinduism itself, while other markings such as tilaka identify a follower of the faith. Hinduism associates many symbols, which include the lotus, chakra and veena , with particular deities.\nMantras are invocations, praise and prayers that through their meaning, sound, and chanting style help a devotee focus the mind on holy thoughts or express devotion to God/the deities. Many devotees perform morning ablutions at the bank of a sacred river while chanting the Gayatri Mantra or Mahamrityunjaya mantras. [133] The epic Mahabharata extols Japa (ritualistic chanting) as the greatest duty in the Kali Yuga (what Hindus believe to be the current age). [134] Many adopt Japa as their primary spiritual practice. [134]\nRituals\nFile:Hindu wedding ceremony fire.jpg\nThe vast majority of Hindus engage in religious rituals on a daily basis. [135] [136] Most Hindus observe religious rituals at home. [137] but observation of rituals greatly vary among regions, villages, and individuals. Devout Hindus perform daily chores such as worshiping at dawn after bathing (usually at a family shrine, and typically includes lighting a lamp and offering foodstuffs before the images of deities), recitation from religious scripts, singing devotional hymns , meditation , chanting mantras, reciting scriptures etc. [137] A notable feature in religious ritual is the division between purity and pollution. Religious acts presuppose some degree of impurity or defilement for the practitioner, which must be overcome or neutralised before or during ritual procedures. Purification, usually with water, is thus a typical feature of most religious action. [137] Other characteristics include a belief in the efficacy of sacrifice and concept of merit, gained through the performance of charity or good works, that will accumulate over time and reduce sufferings in the next world. [137] Vedic rites of fire-oblation ( yajna ) are now only occasional practices, although they are highly revered in theory. In Hindu wedding and burial ceremonies, however, the yajña and chanting of Vedic mantras are still the norm. [138] The rituals, upacharas, change with time. For instance, in the past few hundred years some rituals, such as sacred dance and music offerings in the standard Sodasa Upacharas set prescribed by the Agama Shastra, were replaced by the offerings of rice and sweets.\nOccasions like birth, marriage, and death involve what are often elaborate sets of religious customs. In Hinduism, life-cycle rituals include Annaprashan (a baby's first intake of solid food), Upanayanam (\"sacred thread ceremony\" undergone by upper-caste children at their initiation into formal education) and Śrāddha (ritual of treating people to a meal in return for prayers to 'God' to give peace to the soul of the deceased). [139] [140] For most people in India, the betrothal of the young couple and the exact date and time of the wedding are matters decided by the parents in consultation with astrologers. [139] On death, cremation is considered obligatory for all except sanyasis , hijra , and children under five. [141] Cremation is typically performed by wrapping the corpse in cloth and burning it on a pyre .\nPilgrimage\nFile:Kedarnathroute.jpg\nFollowing pilgrimage sites are most famous amongst Hindu devotees:\nChar Dham (Famous Four Pilgrimage sites): The four holy sites Puri , Rameswaram , Dwarka , and Badrinath (or alternatively the Himalayan towns of Badrinath , Kedarnath , Gangotri , and Yamunotri ) compose the Char Dham (four abodes) pilgrimage circuit.\nKumbh Mela: The Kumbh Mela (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held afetr every 12 years; the location is rotated among Allahabad , Haridwar , Nashik , and Ujjain .\nOld Holy cities as per Puranic Texts: Varanasi formerly known as Kashi, Allahabad formerly known as Prayag, Haridwar - Rishikesh , Mathura - Vrindavan , and Ayodhya .\nMajor Temple cities: Puri , which hosts a major Vaishnava Jagannath temple and Rath Yatra celebration; Katra , home to the Vaishno Devi temple; Three comparatively recent temples of fame and huge pilgrimage are Shirdi , home to Sai Baba of Shirdi , Tirumala - Tirupati , home to the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple ; and Sabarimala ,where Swami Ayyappan is worshipped.\nShakti Peethas: Another important set of pilgrimages are the Shakti Peethas , where the Mother Goddess is worshipped, the two principal ones being Kalighat and Kamakhya .\nWhile there are different yet similar pilgrimage routes in different parts of India, all are respected equally well, according to the universality of Hinduism.\nPilgrimage is not mandatory in Hinduism, though many adherents undertake them. [142]\nFestivals\nFile:Deepawali-festival.jpg\nHindu festivals ( Sanskrit : Utsava; literally: \"to lift higher\") are considered as symbolic rituals that beautifully weave individual and social life to dharma . [143] Hinduism has many festivals throughout the year. The Hindu calendar usually prescribe their dates.\nThe festivals typically celebrate events from Hindu mythology, often coinciding with seasonal changes. There are festivals which are primarily celebrated by specific sects or in certain regions of the Indian subcontinent .\nSome widely observed Hindu festivals are : Template:MultiCol\nMain articles: Śruti , Smriti , and List of Hindu scriptures\nHinduism is based on \"the accumulated treasury of spiritual laws discovered by different persons in different times\". [144] [145] The scriptures were transmitted orally in verse form to aid memorization, for many centuries before they were written down. [146] Over many centuries, sages refined the teachings and expanded the canon. In post-Vedic and current Hindu belief, most Hindu scriptures are not typically interpreted literally. More importance is attached to the ethics and metaphorical meanings derived from them. [18] Most sacred texts are in Sanskrit . The texts are classified into two classes: Shruti and Smriti.\nShruti\nTemplate:Multiple image Shruti (lit: that which is heard) [147] primarily refers to the Vedas, which form the earliest record of the Hindu scriptures. While many Hindus revere the Vedas as eternal truths revealed to ancient sages ( Ṛṣis ), [145] some devotees do not associate the creation of the Vedas with a god or person. They are thought of as the laws of the spiritual world, which would still exist even if they were not revealed to the sages. [144] [148] [149] Hindus believe that because the spiritual truths of the Vedas are eternal, they continue to be expressed in new ways. [150]\nThere are four Vedas (called Ṛg-, Sāma-, Yajus- and Atharva-). The Rigveda is the first and most important Veda. [151] Each Veda is divided into four parts: the primary one, the Veda proper, being the Saṃhitā , which contains sacred mantras. The other three parts form a three-tier ensemble of commentaries, usually in prose and are believed to be slightly later in age than the Saṃhitā. These are: the Brāhmaṇas , Āraṇyakas , and the Upanishads . The first two parts were subsequently called the Karmakāṇḍa (ritualistic portion), while the last two form the Jñānakāṇḍa (knowledge portion). [152] While the Vedas focus on rituals, the Upanishads focus on spiritual insight and philosophical teachings, and discuss Brahman and reincarnation . [18] [153] [154]\nA well known shloka from Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is:\nॐ असतो मा सद्गमय । तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय ।।\nमृत्योर्मामृतं गमय । ॐ शान्ति शान्ति शान्ति ।।\n– बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद् 1.3.28.\nFile:Bhagavad Gita, a 19th century manuscript.jpg\nHindu texts other than the Shrutis are collectively called the Smritis (memory).  The most notable of the smritis are the epics , which consist of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa . The Bhagavad Gītā is an integral part of the Mahabharata and one of the most popular sacred texts of Hinduism. It contains philosophical teachings from Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu, told to the prince Arjuna on the eve of a great war. The Bhagavad Gītā, spoken by Krishna , is described as the essence of the Vedas. [155] However Gita, sometimes called Gitopanishad, is more often placed in the Shruti , category, being Upanishadic in content. [156] Purāṇas , which illustrate Hindu ideas through vivid narratives come under smritis. Other texts include Devī Mahātmya , the Tantras , the Yoga Sutras , Tirumantiram , Shiva Sutras and the Hindu Āgamas . A more controversial text, the Manusmriti , is a prescriptive lawbook which lays the societal codes of social stratification which later evolved into the Indian caste system . [157]\nA well known verse from Bhagavad Gita describing a concept in Karma Yoga is explained as follows [158] [159]\nTo action alone hast thou a right and never at all to its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive;  neither let there be in thee any attachment to inaction. (2.47)\nOrder of precedence of authority\nThe order of precedence regarding authority of Vedic Scriptures is as follows,\nŚruti, literally \"hearing, listening\", are the sacred texts comprising the central canon of Hinduism and is one of the three main sources of dharma and therefore is also influential within Hindu Law . [160]\nSmṛti, literally \"that which is remembered (or recollected)\", refers to a specific body of Hindu religious scripture , and is a codified component of Hindu customary law .  Post Vedic scriptures such as Ramayana , Mahabharata and traditions of the rules on dharma such as Manu Smriti and Yaagnyavalkya Smriti. Smrti also denotes tradition in the sense that it portrays the traditions of the rules on dharma, especially those of lawful virtuous persons.)\nPurāṇa, literally \"of ancient times\", are post-vedic scriptures notably consisting of narratives of the history of the universe from creation to destruction, genealogies of kings, heroes, sages, and demigods, and descriptions of Hindu cosmology, philosophy, and geography. [161]\nŚiṣṭāchāra, literally \"that which is followed by good (in recent times)\".\nAtmatuṣṭi, literally \"that which satisfies oneself (or self validation)\", according to which one has to decide whether or not to do with bona fide. Initially this was not considered in the order of precedence but Manu and Yājñavalkya considered it as last one.\nThat means, if anyone of them contradicts the preceding one then it disqualified as an authority. There is a well known Indian saying that Smṛti follows Śruti. So it was considered that in order to establish any theistic philosophical theory (Astika Siddhanta) one ought not contradict Śruti (Vedas).\nAdi Sankara has chosen three standards and named as Prasthānatrayī, literally, three points of departure (three standards). Later these were referred to as the three canonical texts of reference of Hindu philosophy by other Vedanta schools.\nThey are:\nThe Upanishads , known as Upadesha prasthāna (injunctive texts), (part of Śruti)\nThe Bhagavad Gita , known as Sādhana prasthāna (practical text), (part of Smṛti)\nThe Brahma Sutras , known as Nyāya prasthāna or Yukti prasthana (part of darśana of Uttarā Mīmāṃsā )\nThe Upanishads consist of twelve or thirteen major texts, with many minor texts. The Bhagavad Gītā is part of the Mahabhārata .The Brahma Sūtras (also known as the Vedānta Sūtras), systematise the doctrines taught in the Upanishads and the Gītā.\nDemographics\nFile:Hindu distribution.png\nTemplate:Hinduism by country Hinduism is a major religion in India and, according to a 2001 census, Hinduism was followed by around 80% of the country's population of 1.2 billion (2012 estimate) (960 million adherents). [162] Other significant populations are found in Nepal (23 million), Bangladesh (14 million) and the Indonesian island of Bali (3.3 million).\nCountries with the greatest proportion of Hindus from Hinduism by country (as of 2008 [update] ):\nFile:TVM aps temple.jpg\nHinduism has no central doctrinal authority and many practising Hindus do not claim to belong to any particular denomination. [174] However, academics categorize contemporary Hinduism into four major denominations: Vaishnavism , Shaivism , Shaktism and Smartism . The denominations differ primarily in the god worshipped as the Supreme One and in the traditions that accompany worship of that god.\nVaishnavas worship Vishnu as the supreme God; Shaivites worship Shiva as the supreme; Shaktas worship Shakti (power) personified through a female divinity or Mother Goddess , Devi ; while Smartas believe in the essential oneness of five ( panchadeva ) or six ( Shanmata , as Tamil Hindus add Skanda ) [175] deities as personifications of the Supreme.\nThe Western conception of what Hinduism is has been defined by the Smarta view; many Hindus, who may not understand or follow Advaita philosophy, in contemporary Hinduism, invariably follow the Shanmata belief worshiping many forms of God. One commentator, noting the influence of the Smarta tradition, remarked that although many Hindus may not strictly identify themselves as Smartas but, by adhering to Advaita Vedanta as a foundation for non-sectarianism, are indirect followers. [176]\nFile:Mother Temple of Besakih.jpg\nOther denominations like Ganapatya (the cult of Ganesha ) and Saura ( Sun worship) are not so widespread.\nThere are movements that are not easily placed in any of the above categories, such as Swami Dayananda Saraswati 's Arya Samaj , which rejects image worship and veneration of multiple deities. It focuses on the Vedas and the Vedic fire sacrifices ( yajña ).\nThe Tantric traditions have various sects, as Banerji observes:\nTantras are ... also divided as āstika or Vedic and nāstika or non-Vedic. In accordance with the predominance of the deity the āstika works are again divided as Śākta (Shakta), Śaiva (Shaiva), Saura, Gāṇapatya and Vaiṣṇava (Vaishnava). [177]\nAshramas\nFile:Balmiki.jpg\nTraditionally the life of a Hindu is divided into four Āshramas (phases or stages; unrelated meanings include monastery). The first part of one's life, Brahmacharya , the stage as a student, is spent in celibate, controlled, sober and pure contemplation under the guidance of a Guru , building up the mind for spiritual knowledge. Grihastha is the householder's stage, in which one marries and satisfies kāma and artha in one's married and professional life respectively (see the goals of life ). The moral obligations of a Hindu householder include supporting one's parents, children, guests and holy figures. Vānaprastha , the retirement stage, is gradual detachment from the material world. This may involve giving over duties to one's children, spending more time in religious practices and embarking on holy pilgrimages. Finally, in Sannyāsa , the stage of asceticism , one renounces all worldly attachments to secludedly find the Divine through detachment from worldly life and peacefully shed the body for Moksha . [178]\nMonasticism\nFile:Indian sadhu performing namaste.jpg\nSome Hindus choose to live a monastic life (Sannyāsa) in pursuit of liberation or another form of spiritual perfection. Monastics commit themselves to a life of simplicity, celibacy , detachment from worldly pursuits, and the contemplation of God. [179] A Hindu monk is called a sanyāsī, sādhu , or swāmi . A female renunciate is called a sanyāsini. Renunciates receive high respect in Hindu society because their outward renunciation of selfishness and worldliness serves as an inspiration to householders who strive for mental renunciation. Some monastics live in monasteries, while others wander from place to place, trusting in God alone to provide for their needs. [180] It is considered a highly meritorious act for a householder to provide sādhus with food or other necessaries. Sādhus strive to treat all with respect and compassion, whether a person may be poor or rich, good or wicked, and to be indifferent to praise, blame, pleasure, and pain. [179]\nVarnas\nHindu society has traditionally been categorized into four classes, called Varnas (Sanskrit: \"colour, form, appearance\"): [93]\nthe Brahmins : teachers and priests;\nthe Kshatriyas : warriors, nobles, and kings;\nthe Vaishyas : farmers, merchants, and businessmen; and\nthe Shudras : servants and labourers.\nHindus and scholars debate whether the so-called caste system is an integral part of Hinduism sanctioned by the scriptures or an outdated social custom. [181] Among the scriptures, the Varna system is mentioned sparingly and descriptively (i.e., not prescriptive ); apart from a single mention in the late Rigvedic Purusha sukta , the rigid division into varnas appears to be post-Vedic, appearing in classical texts from the Maurya period . The Bhagavad Gītā ( 4.13 ) states that the four varṇa divisions are created by God, and the Manusmṛiti categorizes the different castes. [182] However, at the same time, the Gītā says that one's varṇa is to be understood from one's personal qualities and one's work, not one's birth. [183] Some mobility and flexibility within the varnas challenge allegations of social discrimination in the caste system, as has been pointed out by several sociologists, [184] [185] although some other scholars disagree. [186]\nMany social reformers, including Mahatma Gandhi and B. R. Ambedkar , criticized caste discrimination. [187] The religious teacher Sri Ramakrishna (1836–1886) taught that\nLovers of God do not belong to any caste . . . . A brahmin without this love is no longer a brahmin. And a pariah with the love of God is no longer a pariah. Through bhakti (devotion to God) an untouchable becomes pure and elevated. [188]\nAhimsa, vegetarianism and other food customs\nMain articles: Ahimsa , Vegetarianism and religion , and Cattle in Religion\nHindus advocate the practice of ahiṃsā (non-violence) and respect for all life because divinity is believed to permeate all beings, including plants and non-human animals. [189] The term ahiṃsā appears in the Upanishads , [190] the epic Mahabharata [191] and Ahiṃsā is the first of the five Yamas (vows of self-restraint) in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras . [192] and the first principle for all member of Varnashrama Dharma (brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya and shudra) in Law of Manu (book 10, sutra 63 : Ahimsa, satya, asteya, shaucam and indrayanigraha, almost similar to main principles of jainism ). [193] [194]\nFile:GntGowSala.jpg.jpg\nIn accordance with ahiṃsā, many Hindus embrace vegetarianism to respect higher forms of life.  Estimates of the number of lacto vegetarians in India (includes adherents of all religions) vary between 20% and 42%. [195] The food habits vary with the community and region, for example some castes having fewer vegetarians and coastal populations relying on seafood. [196] [197] Some avoid meat only on specific holy days. Observant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from beef . The cow in Hindu society is traditionally identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure, [198] and Hindu society honours the cow as a symbol of unselfish giving. [199] Cow-slaughter is legally banned in almost all states of India. [200]\nThere are many Hindu groups that have continued to abide by a strict vegetarian diet in modern times. One example is the movement known as ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness), whose followers “not only abstain from meat, fish, and fowl, but also avoid certain vegetables that are thought to have negative properties, such as onion and garlic.” [201] A second example is the Swaminarayan Movement. The followers of this Hindu group also staunchly adhere to a diet that is devoid of meat, eggs, and seafood. [202]\nFile:Rajasthanthali.jpg\nVegetarianism is propagated by the Yajur Veda and it is recommended for a satvic (purifying) lifestyle. [203] Thus, another reason that dietary purity is so eminent within Hinduism is because “the idea that food reflects the general qualities of nature: purity, energy, inertia” It follows, then, that a healthy diet should be one that promotes purity within an individual. [201]\nBased on this reasoning, Hindus should avoid or minimize the intake of foods that do not promote purity. These foods include onion and garlic, which are regarded as rajasic (a state which is characterized by “tension and overbearing demeanor”) foods, and meat, which is regarded as tamasic (a state which is characterized by “anger, greed, and jealousy”). [204]\nSome Hindus from certain sects - generally Shakta, [205] certain Shudra and Kshatriya castes [206] [207] and certain Eastern Indian [208] and East Asian regions; [209] practise animal sacrifice (bali). [210] Although most Hindus, including the majority of Vaishnava and Shaivite Hindus abhor it. [211]\nConversion\nSee also: Conversion to Hinduism  and Religious_conversion#Hinduism\nClear concepts of conversion , evangelization , and proselytization are absent from Hindu texts, playing a marginal role in practice. Early in their history, in the absence of other competing religions, Hindus considered everyone they came across as Hindus and expected everyone they met to be Hindus. [212] [213]\nHindus today continue to be influenced by historical ideas of acceptability of conversion. [214] Hence, many Hindus continue to believe that Hinduism is an identity that can only be had from birth, [215] while many others continue to believe that anyone who follows Hindu beliefs and practices is a Hindu, [216] and many believe in some form of both theories. However, as a reaction to perceived and actual threat of evangelization, prozelyzation, and conversion activities of other major religions many modern Hindus are opposed to the idea of conversion from (any) one religion to (any) other per se. [217]\nIn Southeast Asia the merchant, sailor, and priestly class accounted for much of the spread of the religion. [218] Many foreign groups including Gujjars , Ahoms , and Hunas converted to Hinduism after generations of Sanskritization . [219] In India and Indonesia today many groups still convert to Hinduism. [220]\nWith the rise of Hindu revivalist movements, conversions to Hinduism have risen. [221] Reconversion of former adherents of Hinduism are well accepted since conversion out of Hinduism is not recognized. [222]\nThere is no formal process for converting to Hinduism, although in many traditions a ritual called dīkshā (\"initiation\") marks the beginning of spiritual life. [223] A ritual called shuddhi (\"purification\") sometimes marks the return to spiritual life after reconversion. [224] Most Hindu sects do not actively seek converts, [225] [226] [227] [228] as they believe that the goals of spiritual life can be attained through any religion, as long as it is practiced sincerely. [225] [229] However, some Hindu sects and affiliates such as Arya Samaj , Saiva Siddhanta Church , BAPS , and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness accept those who have a desire to follow Hinduism.\nSee also",
                "History of Hinduism : definition of History of Hinduism and synonyms of History of Hinduism (English)\nHinduism is a term for a wide variety of related religious traditions native to India . [1] Historically, it encompasses the development of Religion in India since the Iron Age traditions, which in turn stretch back to prehistoric religions such as that of the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization followed by the Iron Age Vedic religion .\nBy the early centuries CE, Indian philosophy was divided into Astika (orthodox) and Nastika (heterodox) depending on whether the authority of the Vedas was accepted. The Astika group was further divided into six branches, evolving from about the 2nd century BCE to the 6th century CE, viz. Samkhya , Yoga , Nyaya , Vaisheshika , Mimamsa , and Vedanta . The Buddhist, Jain, Carvaka and some other schools were classified as Nastika. The different schools in this period competed for adherents and influenced each other. Meanwhile, Tantra and tantric practices emerged in both Astika and Nastika forms. Monotheistic religions like Shaivism , Shaktism and Vaishnavism developed during the same period through the Bhakti movement . Classical Hinduism emerges as a revival of Vedic traditions fused with local folk traditions, with the gradual decline of Buddhism in India starting from around the eighth century. [2]\nHinduism under the Islamic Rulers saw the increasing prominence of the Bhakti movement , which remains influential today. The colonial period saw the emergence of various Hindu reform movements partly inspired by western culture, such as spiritism ( Theosophy ). The Partition of India in 1947 was along religious lines, with the Republic of India emerging with a Hindu majority.\nContents\nMain article: Indus Valley Civilization\n  Seals from the Indus Valley Civilization preserved at the British Museum , depicting the Swastika signs, which are a popular motif in modern Hinduism.\nEvidence of prehistoric religion in India is found in the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization , showing the certain elements of Hinduism such as baths (assumed to serve a ritual purpose) and Symbols , compared to the Shiva lingam . [3] [4] There were also found Swastika signs, which are a popular motif in modern Hinduism.\nA seal discovered during excavation of the Mohenjo-daro archaeological site in the Indus Valley has drawn attention as a possible representation of a \"yogi\" or \"proto-Shiva\" figure. [5] This \" Pashupati \" (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit paśupati) [6] [7] seal shows a seated figure, possibly ithyphallic, surrounded by animals. [8] [9] [10] Some observers describe the figure as sitting in a traditional cross-legged yoga pose with its hands resting on its knees. The discoverer of the seal, Sir John Marshall, and others have claimed that this figure is a prototype of Shiva, and have described the figure as having three faces, seated in a \"yoga posture\" with the knees out and feet joined.\nOther icons suggestive of the Shiva Linga and the accompanying Yoni that are ubiquitous in modern Hinduism have been found during excavations as well. [11] [12] [13]\nAt Kalibangan (at the Ghaggar river) the remains of what some writers claim to be fire altars have been unearthed. [14] S.R. Rao found similar \"fire altars\" in Lothal which he thinks could have served no other purpose than a ritualistic one. [15] The presence of fire altars and ritual sacrifice in these settlements and others has been accepted by authors such as Edwin Bryant . [16] Cylindrical, phallus-shaped objects found associated with these fire altars have been hypothesized as proto-Shiva lingas. [17]\nMany male and female figurines, the female figurines popularly dubbed \"Mother Goddesses\" have been found in the Indus Valley, although some have expressed doubt as to the divine character of these female figures. [18] Additionally, a seal excavated in Mohenjodaro shows a Goddess-like deity seated on a Peepal ( Sacred fig ) tree. [19] The Peepal is considered sacred even today in Hinduism and is often worshipped, and ascetics often rest under it. [20]\nThe prehistoric Indus Valley civilization is believed to have declined by around 1500BC, and Vedism appeared in its place, with the composition of the Vedas and related Vedic Sanskrit texts. [21] However, it is possible that Vedism was influenced by a substratum of Indus Valley civilization culture.[ citation needed ]\n  Vedic period\nFurther information: Iron Age India\nVedism was a religion of the early Indians , speakers of early Old Indic dialects, descended from the Proto-Indo-European language . Liturgy is preserved in the three Vedic Samhitas : the Rig-Veda , Sama-Veda and the Yajur-Veda . Of these, the Rig-Veda the oldest, a collection of hymns dated possibly as early as the 4th millennium BCE. [22] The other two add ceremonial detail for the performance of the actual sacrifice. The Atharva-Veda may also contain compositions dating to before 1000 BC. It contains material pertinent to domestic ritual and folk magic of the period. These texts, as well as the voluminous commentary on orthopraxy collected in the Brahmanas compiled during the early 1st millennium BC, were transmitted by oral tradition alone until the advent of the Pallava and Gupta period and by a combination of written and oral tradition since then.\n  Rigvedic religion\n  The geographical horizon of the Rigveda (given with river names , together with the extent of the Swat and Cemetery H ) extends from the Hindu Kush and the Punjab region to the upper Gangetic plain .\nThe earliest text of the Vedas is the Rigveda , a collection of poetic hymns used in the sacrificial rites of Vedic priesthood . Many Rigvedic hymns concern the fire ritual ( Agnihotra ) and especially the offering of Soma to the gods ( Somayajna ). Soma is both an intoxicant and a god itself, as is the sacrificial fire, Agni . The royal horse sacrifice ( Ashvamedha ) is a central rite in the Yajurveda .\nThe gods in the Rig-Veda are mostly personified concepts, who fall into two categories: the devas – who were gods of nature – such as the weather deity Indra (who is also the King of the gods), Agni (\"fire\"), Usha (\"dawn\"), Surya (\"sun\") and Apas (\"waters\") on the one hand, and on the other hand the asuras – gods of moral concepts – such as Mitra (\"contract\"), Aryaman (guardian of guest, friendship and marriage), Bhaga (\"share\") or Varuna , the supreme Asura (or Aditya). While Rigvedic deva is variously applied to most gods, including many of the Asuras, the Devas are characterized as Younger Gods while Asuras are the Older Gods (pūrve devāḥ). In later Vedic texts, the Asuras become demons.\nThe Rigveda has 10 Mandalas ('books'). There is significant variation in the language and style between the family books (RV books 2–7), book 8 , the \"Soma Mandala\" ( RV 9 ), and the more recent books 1 and 10 . The older books share many aspects of common Indo-Iranian religion, and is an important source for the reconstruction of earlier common Indo-European traditions . Especially RV 8 has striking similarity to the Avesta , [23] containing allusions to Afghan Flora and Fauna, [24] e.g. to camels (úṣṭra- = Avestan uštra). Many of the central religious terms in Vedic Sanskrit have cognates in the religious vocabulary of other Indo-European languages (deva: Latin deus; hotar : Germanic god ; asura: Germanic ansuz ; yajna : Greek hagios ; brahman : Norse Bragi or perhaps Latin flamen etc.). Especially notable is the fact, that in the Avesta Asura (Ahura) is known as good and Deva (Daeva) as evil entity, quite the opposite of the RigVeda.\n  Brahmanism\nFurther information: Brahmana ,  Aranyaka , and  Shrauta Sutra\n  Map of early Iron Age Vedic India after Witzel (1989). Location hypotheses for Vedic shakhas are shown in green.\nDuring a period roughly spanning the 10th to 6th centuries BC, the Mahajanapadas arise from the earlier petty kingdoms of the various Rigvedic tribes , and the failing remnants of the Late Harappan culture. In this period the mantra portions of the Vedas are largely completed, and a flowering industry of Vedic priesthood organized in numerous schools ( shakha ) develops exegetical literature, viz. the Brahmanas . These schools also edited the Vedic mantra portions into fixed recensions, that were to be preserved purely by oral tradition over the following two millennia.\n  Shramana\nMain article: Shramana\nThe Brahmanical tradition was paralleled by the non-Vedic Shramana movement. The Buddha was a member of this movement. [25] Shramana also gave rise to Jainism , [26] yoga , [27] the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara , and the concept of liberation. [28] The Brahmanical ashrama system of life was an attempt to institutionalize Shramana ideals within the Brahmanical social structure. [29] The Shramana movement also influenced the Aranyakas and Upanishads in the Brahmanical tradition. [30]\n  Survival of Vedic ritual\nMain article: Śrauta\nVedism as the religious tradition of Hinduism of a priestly elite was marginalized by other traditions such as Jainism and Buddhism in the later Iron Age, but in the Middle Ages would rise to renewed prestige with the Mimamsa school, which as well as all other astika traditions of Hinduism, considered them authorless ( apaurusheyatva ) and eternal. A last surviving elements of Vedic Hinduism or Vedism is Śrauta tradition, following many major elements of Vedic religion and is prominent in Southern India , with communities in Tamil Nadu , Kerala , Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , but also in some pockets of Uttar Pradesh , Maharashtra and other states; the best known of these groups are the Nambudiri of Kerala, whose traditions were notably documented by Frits Staal . [31] [32] [33]\n  Ancient India\nFurther information: Sangam literature\nThe Mauryan period saw an early flowering of classical Sanskrit Sutra and Shastra literature and the scholarly exposition of the \"circum-Vedic\" fields of the Vedanga . However, during this time Buddhism was patronized by Ashoka , who ruled large parts of India, and Buddhism was also the mainstream religion until the Gupta empire period.\nThe Sangam literature (300 BC – 300 AD) is a mostly secular body of classical literature in the Tamil language . Nonetheless there are some works, significantly Pattupathu and Paripaatal, wherein the personal devotion to god was written in form of devotional poems. Vishnu , Shiva and Murugan were mentioned gods. These works are therefore the earliest evidences of monotheistic Bhakti traditions, preceding the large bhakti movement , which was given great attention in later times.\n  Expansion in South-East Asia\nFurther information: Hinduism in Southeast Asia ,  Greater India , and  Sanskritisation\n  Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.\nFrom about the 1st century, India started to strongly influence Southeast Asian countries. Trade routes linked India with southern Burma , central and southern Siam , lower Cambodia and southern Vietnam and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.\nFor more than a thousand years, Indian Hindu/Buddhist influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The Pali and Sanskrit languages and the Indian script, together with Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism , Brahmanism and Hinduism , were transmitted from direct contact as well as through sacred texts and Indian literature, such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata epics.\nFrom the 5th to the 13th century, South-East Asia had very powerful Indian colonial empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The Sri Vijaya Empire to the south and the Khmer Empire to the north competed for influence.\nLangkasuka (-langkha Sanskrit for \"resplendent land\" -sukkha of \"bliss\") was an ancient Hindu kingdom located in the Malay Peninsula . The kingdom, along with Old Kedah settlement, are probably the earliest territorial footholds founded on the Malay Peninsula. According to tradition, the founding of the kingdom happened in the 2nd century; Malay legends claim that Langkasuka was founded at Kedah , and later moved to Pattani .\nFrom the 5th-15th centuries Sri Vijayan empire , a maritime empire centered on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia , had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism under a line of rulers named the Sailendras . The Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the Chola rulers of India. The Majapahit Empire succeeded the Singhasari empire. It was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in Maritime Southeast Asia .\nFunan was a pre- Angkor Cambodian kingdom, located around the Mekong delta, probably established by Mon–Khmer settlers speaking an Austro-Asiatic language. According to reports by two Chinese envoys, K'ang T'ai and Chu Ying , the state was established by an Indian Brahmin named Kaundinya , who in the 1st century CE was given instruction in a dream to take a magic bow from a temple and defeat a Khmer queen, Soma . Soma, the daughter of the king of the Nagas , married Kaundinya and their lineage became the royal dynasty of Funan. The myth had the advantage of providing the legitimacy of both an Indian Brahmin and the divinity of the cobras, who at that time were held in religious regard by the inhabitants of the region.\nThe kingdom of Champa (or Lin-yi in Chinese records) controlled what is now south and central Vietnam from approximately 192 through 1697. The dominant religion of the Cham people was Hinduism and the culture was heavily influenced by India.\nLater, from the 9th to the 13th century, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu Khmer Empire dominated much of the South-East Asian peninsula. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. Angkor was at the center of this development, with a temple complex and urban organization able to support around one million urban dwellers. The largest temple complex of the world, Angkor Wat, stands here; built by the king Vishnuvardhan, a king of the dynasty that believed themselves to be incarnations of Vishnu.\n  Middle Ages\nFurther information: Hindu philosophy ,  Mimamsa , and  Samkhya\n  Flow chart showing the growth of Bhagavatism\nThe Pallavas (4th to 9th centuries) were, alongside the Guptas of the North , patronizers of Sanskrit in the South of the Subcontinent . The pallava reign saw the first Sankrit inscriptions in a script called Grantha . Early Pallavas had different connections to South-East Asian countries. The Pallavas used Dravidian architecture to build some very important Hindu temples and academies in Mamallapuram , Kanchipuram and other places; their rule saw the rise of great poets, who are as famous as.\nThe Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries) saw a flowering of scholarship, the emergence of the classical schools of Hindu philosophy , and of classical Sanskrit literature in general on topics ranging from medicine, veterinary science, mathematics, to astrology and astronomy and astrophysics. The famous Aryabhata and Varahamihira belong to this age. The Gupta established a strong central government which also allowed a degree of local control. Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs. This included a strict caste system, or class system. The peace and prosperity created under Gupta leadership enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors.\nThe practice of dedicating temples to different deities came into vogue followed by fine artistic temple architecture and sculpture (see Vastu Shastra ).\n  Brahmanical Expansion at the Expense of Buddhism\nMain articles: Decline of Buddhism in India , Vaishnavism , and Shaivism\nRonald Inden notes:\n\"before the eighth century, the Buddha was accorded the position of universal deity and ceremonies by which a king attained to imperial status were elaborate donative ceremonies entailing gifts to Buddhist monks and the installation of a symbolic Buddha in a stupa....This pattern changed in the eighth century. The Buddha was replaced as the supreme, imperial deity by one of the Hindu gods (except under the Palas of eastern India, the Buddha's homeland)...Previously the Buddha had been accorded imperial-style worship (puja). Now as one of the Hindu gods replaced the Buddha at the imperial centre and pinnacle of the cosmo-political system, the image or symbol of the Hindu god comes to be housed in a monumental temple and given increasingly elaborate imperial-style puja worship.\" [34]\nThe replacement of the Buddha as the \"cosmic person\" coincided with the same period of time that the Buddha was incorporated and subordinated within the cult of Vishnu as an avatar. Although Buddhism did not disappear from India for several centuries after the eighth, royal proclivities for the cults of Vishnu and Shiva weakened Buddhism's position within the sociopolitical context and helped make possible its decline. [35]\n  Pauranic Hinduism\nFurther information: Puranas\nBrahmanic Hinduism evolves out of Vedism during Iron Age India, and in turn contributes to the development of Vedantic and eventually classical Pauranic Hinduism . The transformation of Brahmanism into Pauranic Hinduism in post- Gupta India was due to a process of acculturation . The Puranas helped establish a religious mainstream among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation. The tenets of Brahmanic Hinduism and of the Dharmashastras underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of a mainstream \"Hinduism\" that overshadowed all earlier traditions. [36]\n  Bhakti movement\nSee also: Tulsidas , Kabir , Mirabai , and Chaitanya\nThe Bhakti movement was a Hindu religious movement in which the main spiritual practice was the fostering of loving devotion to God, called bhakti . It was a movement generally devoted to worship of Shiva , Vishnu or Shakti .\nThe first documented bhakti movement was founded by Karaikkal-ammaiyar . She wrote poems in Tamil about her love for Shiva and probably lived around the 6th century CE. The twelve Alvars who were Vaishnavite devotees and the sixty-three Nayanars who were Shaivite devotees nurtured the incipient bhakti movement in Tamil Nadu . They constitute South India's 75 Apostles of Bhakti .\nDuring the 12th century CE in Karnataka, the Bhakti movement took the form of the Virashaiva movement. It was inspired by Basavanna , a Hindu reformer who created the sect of Lingayats or Shiva bhaktas. During this time, a unique and native form of Kannada literature-poetry called Vachanas was born.\nHanshaw, Mark. \"A Hindu Vision of Grace for a Western Christian Community..\" Religion East & West. 8 (2008): 75-94. Print.\n  Advaita Vedanta\nFurther information: Muslim conquest of South Asia\nMuslim rulers began to extend their rule across Hindu-Buddhist populated lands in the 8th century CE and the Abrahamic religion of Islam began to spread across the Indian-subcontinent over several centuries. Most converts were from Hinduism or Buddhism , the two dominant local religions. While all traditions of popular Hinduism continued – including the worship of popular reincarnations of the primordial Shakti – Bhakti tradition attained new prominence; Bhakti poetry of lasting greatness was composed in northern India under the rule of Muslim emperors. The humble mystic saint Kabir , who established his own order, composed devotional verses in the Bhakti spirit, but in common-man's Hindi dialect and transcending the Hindu-Muslim theocratic divide. Tulsidas , Mira Bai and Surdas composed immortal Hindu devotional poetry in Hindi-dialects in the Mughal period – it is reminiscent of the earlier Kannada and Tamil Bhakti poetry of South India.\n  Mughal India\nFurther information: Mughal period\n  Photograph of the Surya Temple, The most impressive and grandest ruins in Kashmir, at Marttand-Hardy Cole's Archaeological Survey of India Report 'Illustrations of Ancient Buildings in Kashmir.' (1869)\nAfter the conquest of Persia by the Mongol Empire , a regional Turko-Persio-Mongol dynasty formed. Just as eastern Mongol dynasties inter-married with locals and adopted the local religion of Buddhism and the Chinese culture , this group adopted the local religion of Islam and the Persian culture ; their descendants ruled in India as Mughals .\nThe official State religion of the Mughal Empire was Islam , with the preference to the jurisprudence of the Hanafi Madhab (Mazhab). Hinduism remained under strain during Babur and Humanyun's reigns. Sher Shah Suri, the Afghan ruler of North India was comparatively non-repressive. Hinduism came to fore during the three year rule of Hindu king ' Hemu ' during 1553-56 when he had defeated Akbar at Agra and Delhi and had taken up the reign from Delhi as a Hindu 'Vikramaditya' king after his 'Rajyabhishake' or coronation at ' Purana Quila ' in Delhi. However, during Mughal history, at times, subjects had freedom to practice any religion of their choice, though Non-Muslim able-bodied adult males with income were obliged to pay the Jizya (poll-tax to be spent by the State only on protection of non-Muslims), which signified their status as Dhimmis (responsibility of the State, in regard to safety of life and property).\n  An 1868 photograph of the ruins of the Vijayanagara Empire at Hampi , now a UNESCO World Heritage Site [37]\nAkbar , the Mughal emperor Humayun 's son and heir from his Sindhi queen Hameeda Banu Begum, had a broad vision of Indian and Islamic traditions. One of Emperor Akbar 's most unusual ideas regarding religion was Din-i-Ilahi (Faith of God), which was an eclectic mix of Islam , Zoroastrianism , Hinduism, Jainism and Christianity . It was proclaimed the state religion until his death. These actions however met with stiff opposition from the Muslim clergy, especially the Sufi Shaykh Alf Sani Ahmad Sirhindi . Akbar's abolition of poll-tax on non-Muslims, acceptance of ideas from other religious philosophies, toleration of public worship by all religions and his interest in other faiths showed an attitude of considerable religious tolerance, which, in the minds of his orthodox Muslim opponents, were tantamount to apostasy .\nAkbar's son, Jahangir , half Rajput, was also a religious moderate, his mother being Hindu. The influence of his two Hindu queens (the Maharani Maanbai and Maharani Jagat) kept religious moderation as a center-piece of state policy which was extended under his son, Emperor Shah Jahan , who was by blood 75% Rajput and less than 25% Moghul .\nReligious orthodoxy would only play an important role during the reign of Shah Jahan's son and successor, Aurangzeb , a devout Sunni Muslim. Aurangzeb was comparatively less tolerant of other faiths than his predecessors had been, and his reign saw an increase in the number and importance of Islamic institutions and scholars. He led many military campaigns against the remaining non-Muslim powers of the Indian subcontinent – the Sikh states of the Punjab, the last independent Hindu Rajputs and the Maratha rebels – as also against the Shia Muslim kingdoms of the Deccan . He also virtually stamped out, from his empire, open proselytisation of Hindus and Muslims by foreign Christian Missionaries , who remained successfully active, however, in the adjoining regions: the present day Kerala , Tamilnadu and Goa .\n  Early Modern period\nThe fall of Vijayanagar Empire to Muslim rulers had marked the end of Hindu imperial assertions in the Deccan . But, taking advantage of an over-stretched Mughal Empire , Hinduism once again rose to political prestige, under the Maratha Empire , from 1707 to 1761 .\n  Maratha Empire\nFurther information: Maratha Empire\n  The last Hindu empire of India – The Maratha Empire in 1760.\nThe Hindu Marathas long had lived in the Desh region around Satara , in the western portion of the Deccan plateau, where the plateau meets the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats mountains. They had resisted incursions into the region by the Muslim Mughal rulers of northern India. Under their leader Shivaji , the Maratha freed themselves from the Muslim sultans of Bijapur to the southeast and, becoming much more aggressive, began to frequently raid Mughal territory, eventually sacking the wealthy Mughal port of Surat in 1664. After substantial territorial gains, Shivaji was proclaimed 'Chhatrapati' (Emperor) in 1674; the Marathas had spread and conquered much of central India by Shivaji's death in 1680. Subsequently, under the able leadership of the prime ministers ( Peshwas ), who often led as generals also, Maratha Empire reached its zenith. Pune , the seat of Peshwas, flowered as a centre of Hindu learning and traditions. In 1761, the empire broke into smaller Maratha kingdoms that survived till they were eventually subdued by the British East India Company .\n  Early colonialism\nFurther information: Christianity in India  and  Goa Inquisition\nPortuguese missionaries had reached the Malabar Coast in the late 15th century, made contact with the St Thomas Christians in Kerala and sought to introduce the Latin Rite among them. Since the priests for St Thomas Christians were served by the Eastern Christian Churches , they were following Eastern Christian practices at that time. Throughout this period, foreign missionaries also made many new converts to Christianity. This led to the formation of the Latin Catholics in Kerala.\nThe Goa Inquisition was the office of the Christian Inquisition acting in the Indian city of Goa and the rest of the Portuguese empire in Asia. St. Francis Xavier , in a 1545 letter to John III , requested for an Inquisition to be installed in Goa. It was installed eight years after the death of Francis Xavier in 1552. Established in 1560 and operating until 1774, this highly controversial institution was aimed primarily at Hindus and wayward new converts.\nIn the century from 1760 to 1860, India was once more divided into numerous petty and unstable kingdoms: the Sikh Confederacy ; the \"lesser Mughals\" following Bahadur Shah I ; the Kingdom of Mysore ; Hyderabad State ; the Durrani Empire ; and the territories held by the British East India Company . The entire subcontinent fell under British rule (partly indirectly , via Princely states ) following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 .\n  British Raj\nFurther information: Bengal Renaissance ,  Brahmo Samaj ,  Arya Samaj , and  Ramakrishna Math\n  1909 Prevailing Religions, Map of British Indian Empire, 1909, showing the prevailing majority religions of the population for different districts.\nDuring the 19th century, Hinduism developed a large number of new religious movements , partly inspired by the European Romanticism , nationalism , and esotericism ( Theosophy ) popular at the time (while conversely and contemporaneously, India had a similar effect on European culture with Orientalism , \" Hindoo style \" architecture, reception of Buddhism in the West and similar).\nThese reform movements are summarized under Hindu revivalism and continue into the present.\nSwaminarayan establishes the Swaminarayan Sampraday sect around 1800.\nBrahmo Samaj is a social and religious movement founded in Kolkata in 1828 by Raja Ram Mohan Roy . He was one of the first Indians to visit Europe and was influenced by western thought. He died in Bristol , England. The Brahmo Samaj movement thereafter resulted in the bm gbj,gh, vgBrahmo religion in 1850 founded by Debendranath Tagore — better known as the father of Rabindranath Tagore .\nSri Ramakrishna and his pupil Swami Vivekananda led a reform in Hinduism in late 19th century. Their ideals and sayings have inspired numerous Indians as well as non-Indians, Hindus as well as non-Hindus. Among the prominent figures whose ideals were very much influenced by them were Rabindranath Tagore , Gandhi , Subhas Bose , Satyendranath Bose , Megh Nad Saha , and Sister Nivedita [ citation needed ].\nArya Samaj (\"Society of Nobles \") is a Hindu reform movement in India that was founded by Swami Dayananda in 1875. He was a sannyasin (renouncer) who believed in the infallible authority of the Vedas . Dayananda advocated the doctrine of karma and reincarnation , and emphasised the ideals of brahmacharya ( chastity ) and sanyasa ( renunciation ). Dayananda claimed to be rejecting all non-Vedic beliefs altogether. Hence the Arya Samaj unequivocally condemned idolatry , animal sacrifices , ancestor worship , pilgrimages , priestcraft, offerings made in temples , the caste system, untouchability and child marriages , on the grounds that all these lacked Vedic sanction. It aimed to be a universal church [ disambiguation needed ] based on the authority of the Vedas . Dayananda stated that he wanted 'to make the whole world Aryan', i.e. he wanted to develop missionary Hinduism based on the universality of the Vedas. To this end, the Arya Samaj started Shuddhi movement in early 20th century to bring back to Hinduism people converted to Islam and Christianity , set up schools and missionary organisations, and extended its activities outside India. It now has branches around the world and has a disproportional number of adherents among people of Indian ancestry in Suriname and the Netherlands, in comparison with India.[ citation needed ]\n  Reception in the West\nFurther information: Sanskrit in the West ,  Esotericism in Germany and Austria , and  Ramakrishna's impact\nAn important development during the British colonial period was the influence Hindu traditions began to form on Western thought and new religious movements . An early champion of Indian-inspired thought in the West was Arthur Schopenhauer who in the 1850s advocated ethnics based on an \"Aryan-Vedic theme of spiritual self-conquest\", as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism of the superficially this-worldly \"Jewish\" spirit. [38] Helena Blavatsky moved to India in 1879, and her Theosophical Society , founded in New York in 1875, evolved into a peculiar mixture of Western occultism and Hindu mysticism over the last years of her life.\nThe sojourn of Vivekananda to the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 had a lasting effect. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission , a Hindu missionary organization still active today.\nIn the early 20th century, Western occultists influenced by Hinduism include Maximiani Portaz – an advocate of \"Aryan Paganism\" – who styled herself Savitri Devi and Jakob Wilhelm Hauer , founder of the German Faith Movement . It was in this period, and until the 1920s, that the swastika became an ubiquitous symbol of good luck in the West before its association with the Nazi Party became dominant in the 1930s.\nHinduism-inspired elements in Theosophy were also inherited by the spin-off movements of Ariosophy and Anthroposophy and ultimately contributed to the renewed New Age boom of the 1960s to 1980s, the term New Age itself deriving from Blavatsky's 1888 The Secret Doctrine .\n  Contemporary Hinduism\nMain articles: Contemporary Hindu movements , Hindu denominations , Contemporary Sant Mat movements , List of Hindu organisations , and Hinduism by country\nAs of 2007, of an estimated 944 million Hindus, 98.5% live in South Asia. Of the remaining 1.5% or 14 million, 6 million live in Southeast Asia (mostly Indonesia ), 2 million in Europe, 1.8 million in North America, 1.2 million in Southern Africa .\n  South Asia\nModern Hinduism is the reflection of continuity and progressive changes that occurred in various traditions and institutions of Hinduism during the 19th and 20th centuries. Its main divisions are into Vaishnavism (largely influenced by Bhakti ), Shaivism , Shaktism and Smartism ( Advaita Vedanta ).\nBesides these traditional denominations, movements of Hindu revivalism look to founders such as Swami Vivekananda , Swami Dayananda ( Arya Samaj ), Rabindranath Tagore , Ramana Maharshi , Aurobindo , Shriram Sharma Acharya , Swami Sivananda , Swami Rama Tirtha , Narayana Guru , Paramhansa Yogananda , Swami Chinmayananda , Shrii Shrii Anandamurti , Pandurang Shastri Athavale ( Swadhyay Movement ) and others.\nThe Hindutva movement advocating Hindu nationalism originated in the 1920s and has remained a strong political force in India. The major party of the religious right, Bharatiya Janata Party , since its foundation in 1980 has won several elections, and after a defeat in 2004 remains the leading force of opposition against the current Congress Party government.\n  Southeast Asia\nThe resurgence of Hinduism in Indonesia is occurring in all parts of the country. In the early seventies, the Toraja people of Sulawesi were the first to be identified under the umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the Karo Batak of Sumatra in 1977 and the Ngaju Dayak of Kalimantan in 1980.\nThe growth of Hinduism has been driven also by the famous Javanese prophesies of Sabdapalon and Jayabaya . Many recent converts to Hinduism had been members of the families of Sukarno 's PNI, and now support Megawati Sukarnoputri . This return to the 'religion of Majapahit ' (Hinduism) is a matter of nationalist pride.\nThe new Hindu communities in Java tend to be concentrated around recently built temples (pura) or around archaeological temple sites (candi) which are being reclaimed as places of Hindu worship. An important new Hindu temple in eastern Java is Pura Mandaragiri Sumeru Agung, located on the slope of Mt. Semeru , Java's highest mountain. Mass conversions have also occurred in the region around Pura Agung Blambangan, another new temple, built on a site with minor archaeological remnants attributed to the kingdom of Blambangan , the last Hindu polity on Java, and Pura Loka Moksa Jayabaya (in the village of Menang near Kediri).\n  Neo-Hindu movements in the west\n^ Svarghese, Alexander P. 2008.

                "In the sport of cricket, the wicket is one of the two sets of three stumps and two bails at either end of the pitch.   The wicket is guarded by a batsman who, with his bat, attempts to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket. The origin of the word is from wicket gate, a small gate. Historically, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate.  The third (middle) stump was introduced in 1775.\n\nThrough metonymic usage, the dismissal of a batsman is the taking of a wicket,[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/239756.html \"A glossary of cricket terms\". ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 13 May 2008.] and the cricket pitch is sometimes called the wicket.\n\nLaws of Cricket\n\nThe size and shape of the wicket has changed several times during the last 300 years and its dimensions and placing is now determined by Law 8 in the Laws of Cricket, thus:\n\n* Law 8: The wickets.  The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are 28 in tall. The stumps are placed along the batting crease with equal distances between each stump. They are positioned so they are 9 in wide. Two wooden bails are placed in shallow grooves on top of the stumps. The bails must not project more than  above the stumps, and must, for men's cricket, be  long.\n\nThere are also specified lengths for the barrel and spigots of the bail. There are different specifications for the wickets and bails for junior cricket. The umpires may dispense with the bails if conditions are unfit (e.g., if it is windy they might fall off by themselves). Further details on the specifications of the wickets are contained in Appendix A to the laws.\n\nDismissing a batsman\n\nLosing a wicket refers to a batsman getting out. If dismissed by a bowler, the bowler is said to have taken his wicket. The number of wickets taken is the primary measure of a bowler's ability.\n\nFor a batsman to be dismissed by being bowled, run out, stumped or hit wicket, his wicket needs to be put down. What this means is defined by Law 28 of the Laws of cricket. crickets wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the grounds by the ball, the striker's bat, the striker's person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a fielder (with his hand or arm, and provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used). A 2010 amendment to the Laws clarified the rare circumstance where a bat breaks during the course of a shot and the detached debris breaks the wicket; the wicket has been put down in this circumstance.  The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner.\n\nIf one bail is off, removing the remaining bail or striking or pulling any of the three stumps out of the ground is sufficient to put the wicket down. A fielder may remake the wicket, if necessary, in order to put it down to have an opportunity of running out a batsman.\n\nIf however both bails are off, a fielder must remove one of the three stumps out of the ground with the ball, or pull it out of the ground with a hand or arm, provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used.\n\nIf the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails to remain on the stumps, the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker's bat, person, or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above, or by a fielder with the hand holding the ball or with the arm of the hand holding the ball.\n\nPartnership\n\nThe sequence of time over which two particular batsmen bat together, a partnership, is referred to as a specifically numbered wicket when discriminating it from other partnerships in the innings.\n*The first ' partnership is from the start of the innings until one of the first two batsmen gets out.\n* The second wicket partnership is from when the third batsman gets in until a second batsman gets out.\n* etc...\n* The tenth wicket or last wicket partnership is from when the eleventh (last) batsman gets in until a tenth (last) batsman gets out.\n\nWinning by number of wickets\n\nA team can win a match by a certain number of wickets. This means that they were batting last, and reached the winning target with a certain number of batsmen still not dismissed. A team's innings ends when ten batsmen are dismissed, so, for example, if the side scored the required number of runs to win with only three batsmen dismissed, they are said to have won by seven wickets.\n\nThe pitch\n\nThe word wicket is also sometimes used to refer to the cricket pitch itself. According to the Laws of Cricket, this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. This usage probably derives from the days when the outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface, which was specially prepared, was protected from them by a light wicker fence around it. Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers it is quite possible that the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence.\n\nThe term sticky wicket refers to a situation in which the pitch has become damp, typically due to rain or high humidity. This makes the path of the ball more unpredictable thus making the job of defending the stumps that much more difficult. The full phrase is thought to have originally been \"to bat on a sticky wicket.\" Such pitches were commonplace at all levels of the game (i.e. up to Test Match level) until the late 1950s.\n\nIn other sports\n\nThe arches used in croquet and roque are sometimes referred to as wickets, especially in American English.  These arches descend from the ancestral game of ground billiards (which may also be related to cricket), and were formerly called the hoop, arch or port.  The port remained a prominent feature of indoor table billiards until well into the 18th century.",
                "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a cricket field, at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a wicket, a set of three wooden stumps sited at each end. One team, designated the batting team, attempts to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents field. Each phase of play is called an innings. After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a set number of overs have been completed, the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles. The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained, during their period batting. \n\nAt the start of each game, two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play. The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team, known as the bowler, delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other, towards a set of wooden stumps, in front of which stands one of the batsmen, known as the striker. The striker's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat, and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs. The other batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler. The bowler's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman, at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease.\n\nThe most common forms of dismissal are bowled, when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball, leg before wicket, when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat, and caught, when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground. Runs are scored through two main methods: either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary, or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball. If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground, a run-out occurs. Adjudication is performed on-field by two umpires.\n\nThe laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). There are various formats ranging from Twenty20, played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs, to Test cricket, played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard, solid object made of compressed leather enclosing a cork core.\n\nAlthough cricket's origins are uncertain, it is first recorded in south-east England in the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, leading to the first international matches in the mid-19th century. ICC, the game's governing body, has over 100 members, ten of which are full members who play Test cricket. Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport, after association football, and is followed primarily in Australasia, Great Britain and Ireland, the Indian subcontinent, southern Africa and the West Indies.\n\nEtymology\n\nA number of words have been suggested as sources for the term \"cricket\". In the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598 it is called creckett.  One possible source for the name is the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.Birley, p. 3. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from \"cryce, Saxon, a stick\".  In Old French, the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick. Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch  krick(-e), meaning a stick (crook). Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.  According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").  Dr Gillmeister believes that not only the name but the sport itself is of Flemish origin. \n\nHistory\n\nCricket can definitely be traced back to Tudor times in early 16th-century England though there have been a number of claims, many of them spurious and/or lacking evidence, supporting earlier dates from 1301. The earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a 1598 court case which mentions that \"creckett\" (sic) was played on common land in Guildford around 1550. The court in Guildford heard on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date, equating to the year 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) from a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that when he was a scholar at the \"Free School at Guildford\", fifty years earlier, \"hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play [on the common land] at creckett and other plaies.\" Altham, p. 21.\n\nIt is believed that cricket was originally a children's game but references around 1610 indicate that adults had started playing it and the earliest reference to inter-parish or village cricket occurs soon afterwards. In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.McCann, pp. xxxiii–xxxiv. During the 17th century, numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of England. By the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that the first professionals appeared in the years following the Restoration in 1660. A newspaper report survives of \"a great cricket match\" with eleven players a side that was played for high stakes in Sussex in 1697, and this is the earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance. \n\nThe game underwent major development in the 18th century. Betting played a key part in that development with rich patrons forming their own \"select XIs\". Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season. Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old \"hockey stick\" shape. The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw). \n\nThe 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling. Both developments were controversial. Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839, which ultimately formed the official County Championship in 1890. Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in India, North America, the Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between the United States and Canada. In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tour. \n\nThe first Australian team to tour overseas was a team of Aboriginal stockmen who travelled to England in 1868 to play matches against county teams.  In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia. The most famous player of the 19th century was W. G. Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865. \n\nIn 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia. The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882 and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest. Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England. \n\nThe last two decades before the First World War have been called the \"Golden Age of cricket\". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed. \n\nThe inter-war years were dominated by one player: Australia's Don Bradman, statistically the greatest batsman of all time. Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the West Indies, India and New Zealand before the Second World War and then Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh in the post-war period. South Africa was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 because of its government's apartheid policy.\n\nCricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant. As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased. The first Limited Overs International was played in 1971. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) saw its potential and staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975. In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20, has made an immediate impact.\n\nRules and game-play\n\nCricket is a bat and ball game, played between two teams of eleven players each.   One team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen. The objective of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent. In some forms of cricket, it may also be necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn.\n\nFormat of the game\n\nA cricket match is divided into periods called innings (which ends with \"s\" in both singular and plural form). It is decided before the match whether the teams will have one innings or two innings each. During an innings one team fields and the other bats. The two teams switch between fielding and batting after each innings. All eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but only two members of the batting team (two batsmen) are on the field at any given time. The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.\n\nA coin toss is held by the team captains (who are also players) just before the match starts: the winner decides whether to bat or field first.\n\nThe cricket field is usually circular or oval in shape, with a rectangular pitch at the center. The edge of the playing field is marked with a boundary, which could be a fence, part of the stands, a rope or a painted line.\n\nAt each end of the pitch is a wooden target called a wicket, placed 22 yards apart. The pitch is marked with painted lines: a bowling crease in line with the wicket, and a batting or popping crease four feet in front of it. The wicket is made of three vertical stumps supporting two small horizontal bails. A wicket is put down if at least one bail is dislodged, or one stump is knocked down (usually by the ball, but also if the batsman does it with his body, clothing or equipment). This is also described as breaking, knocking down, or hitting the wicket - though if the ball hits the wicket but does not dislodge a bail or stump then it is not considered to be down.\n\nAt any instant each batsman owns a particular wicket (usually the one closer to him) and, except when actually batting, is safe when he is in his ground. This means that at least one part of his body or bat is touching the ground behind the popping crease. If his wicket is put down while the ball is live and he is out of his ground then he is dismissed, but the other batsman is safe. \n\nThe two batsmen take positions at opposite ends of the pitch. One designated member of the fielding team, called the bowler, bowls the ball from one end of the pitch to the striking batsman at the other end. The batsman at the bowling end is called the non-striker, and stands to the side of his wicket, behind his crease. The batsman are allowed to step forward of their creases, though at some risk. Another member of the fielding team, the wicket keeper, is positioned behind the striker's wicket.\n\nThe fielding team's other nine members stand outside the pitch, spread out across the field. The fielding captain often strategically changes their position between balls.\n\nThere is always an umpire at each end of the pitch.\n\nThe bowler usually retreats a few yards (metres) behind the wicket, runs towards it (his run-up), and then releases the ball over-hand as he reaches the bowling crease. (If he crosses the crease before he releases the ball, or if he flexes his elbow too much in a throw, then it is a no ball, and the batting team gets a penalty or extra run. If the ball passes the far wicket out of reach of the batsman then it is called a wide, also with an extra run.) The ball can be bowled so that it bounces on the pitch, lands exactly on the crease (a yorker), or crosses the crease without bouncing (a full toss).\n\nThe batsman tries to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket by striking the ball with his bat. (This includes the handle of the bat, and his gloves.) If the bowler succeeds in putting down the wicket the batsman is dismissed and is said to be bowled out. If the batsman misses the ball, but any part of his body prevents it from reaching the wicket, then he is out leg before wicket, or \"LBW\".\n\nIf the batsman hits the ball but it is caught by a fielder without bouncing then he is caught out. If it is caught by the bowler then he is caught and bowled; by the wicket keeper, caught behind.\n\nIf the batsman is successful in striking the ball and it is not caught without bouncing, then the two batsmen may try to score points (runs) for their team. Both batsmen run the length of the pitch, exchanging positions, and grounding their bats behind the opposite crease. Each crossing and grounding by both batsmen is worth one run. The batsmen may attempt one run, multiple runs, or elect not to run at all. By attempting runs, the batsmen risk dismissal. This happens if the fielding team retrieves the ball and hits either wicket with the ball (either by throwing it, or while holding it) before the batsman who owns that wicket reaches his ground behind the crease. The dismissed batsman is run out. Batsmen will sometimes start to run, change their mind, and return to their original positions.\n\nIf the batsman hits the ball over the field boundary without the ball touching the field, the batting team scores six runs. If the ball touches the ground and then reaches the boundary, the batting team scores four runs. The batsmen might start running before the ball reaches the boundary, but those runs don't count.\n\nIf the batsman misses the ball they can still attempt extra runs : these are called byes. If the ball bounces off his body then it is called a leg bye.\n\nIf the striking batsman leaves his ground and misses the ball, then the wicket keeper can catch it and put down the wicket – stumped.\n\nIn case of a no ball or a wide the batsman can choose to strike the ball, earning runs in addition to the fixed penalty. If he does so he can only be dismissed by being run out.\n\nWhen the batsmen have finished attempting their runs the ball is dead, and is returned to the bowler to be bowled again. The ball becomes live when he starts his run up. The bowler continues to bowl toward the same wicket, regardless of any switch of the batsmen's positions. \n\nA batsman may retire from an innings without being dismissed, usually after reaching a milestone like a hundred runs (a century).\n\nA dismissed batsman leaves the field, to be replaced by another batsman from the batting team. However, even though the wicket may have been put down, or the ball caught, the batsman is not actually dismissed until the fielding team appeal to the umpires for a decision, traditionally using the expression \"How's that\" (or \"Howzat\"). In some matches, particularly test matches, either team may request a review by a third umpire who can use a decision review system (DRS), which includes TV replays and other electronic equipment such as Hawk-Eye, Hot Spot and the Snickometer.\n\nAfter a bowler has bowled six times (an over), another member of the fielding team is designated as the new bowler, the old bowler taking up a fielding position. The batsmen stay in place, and the new bowler bowls to the opposite wicket, so the role of striker and non-striker reverse. The wicket keeper and the two umpires always change positions, as do many of the fielders, and play continues. Fielding team members may bowl multiple times during an innings, but may not bowl two overs in succession.\n\nThe innings is complete when 10 of the 11 members of the batting team have been dismissed (all out - although one always remaining \"not out\"), when a set number of overs has been played, or when the batting team declares that they have enough runs.\n\nThe number of innings and the number of overs per innings vary depending on the format of the match. In a match which is not a limited overs format the umpires will usually specify that the last session of the last innings will have a specified number of overs.\n\nThe match always ends when all innings have been completed. The umpires can also call an end to the match in case of bad light or weather. But in many cases the match ends immediately when the first team to bat has played all of its innings, and the last team to bat has more runs. In four-innings games the last team may not even need to play its second innings: this team is said to win by an innings. If this winning team has not completed its last innings, and still has, for example, five batsmen who are not out or have not even batted, then they are said to \"win by five wickets\". If the last team to bat is losing, is all out, and has 10 fewer runs than the other team, then the winning team \"wins by 10 runs\". If the two teams both play all their innings and they have the same number of runs, then it is a tie.\n\nIn four-innings matches there is also the possibility of a draw: the team with fewer runs still has batsmen on the field when the game ends. This has a major effect on strategy: a team will often declare an innings when they have accumulated enough runs, in the hope that they will have enough time left to dismiss the other team and thus avoid a draw, but risking a loss if the other team scores enough runs.\n\nPitch, wickets and creases\n\nPlaying surface\n\nCricket is played on a grassy field.  The Laws of Cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field,  but it is often oval. In the centre of the field is a rectangular strip, known as the pitch.\n\nThe pitch is a flat surface 10 ft wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses.  At either end of the pitch, 22 yd apart, are placed wooden targets, known as the wickets. These serve as a target for the bowling (also known as the fielding) side and are defended by the batting side, which seeks to accumulate runs.\n\nStumps, bails and creases\n\nEach wicket on the pitch consists of three wooden stumps placed vertically, in line with one another. They are surmounted by two wooden crosspieces called bails; the total height of the wicket including bails is  and the combined width of the three stumps, including small gaps between them is 9 in.\n\nFour lines, known as creases, are painted onto the pitch around the wicket areas to define the batsman's \"safe territory\" and to determine the limit of the bowler's approach. These are called the \"popping\" (or batting) crease, the bowling crease and two \"return\" creases.\n\nThe stumps are placed in line on the bowling creases and so these creases must be 22 yd apart. A bowling crease is 8 ft long, with the middle stump placed dead centre. The popping crease has the same length, is parallel to the bowling crease and is 4 ft in front of the wicket. The return creases are perpendicular to the other two; they are adjoined to the ends of the popping crease and are drawn through the ends of the bowling crease to a length of at least 8 ft.\n\nWhen bowling the ball, the bowler's back foot in his \"delivery stride\" must land within the two return creases while at least some part of his front foot must land on or behind the popping crease. If the bowler breaks this rule, the umpire calls \"No ball\".\n\nThe importance of the popping crease to the batsman is that it marks the limit of his safe territory. He can be dismissed stumped or run out (see Dismissals below) if the wicket is broken while he is \"out of his ground\".\n\nBat and ball\n\nThe essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers the ball from his end of the pitch towards the batsman who, armed with a bat is \"on strike\" at the other end.\n\nThe bat is made of wood (usually White Willow) and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than  wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 in.\n\nThe ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 in. The hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 90 mph, is a matter for concern and batsmen wear protective clothing including pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves for the hands, a helmet for the head and a box inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area). Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The ball has a \"seam\": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent, and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During cricket matches, the quality of the ball changes to a point where it is no longer usable, and during this decline its properties alter and thus influence the match. Players will therefore attempt to changes the properties of the ball in order to influence its flight. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing, while rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam is illegal ball tampering.\n\nUmpires and scorers\n\nThe game on the field is regulated by two umpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called \"square leg\", a position 15–20 metres to the side of the \"on strike\" batsman. The main role of the umpires is to adjudicate on whether a ball is correctly bowled (not a no ball or a wide), when a run is scored, and whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase How's That?). Umpires also determine when intervals start and end, decide on the suitability of the playing conditions and can interrupt or even abandon the match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.\n\nOff the field and in televised matches, there is often a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test matches and limited overs internationals played between two ICC full members. These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws of cricket and the spirit of the game.\n\nThe match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire. For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws of cricket to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.\n\nInnings\n\nThe innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for the collective performance of the batting side.  In theory, all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they all do so. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has one or two innings apiece.\n\nThe main aim of the bowler, supported by his fielders, is to dismiss the batsman. A batsman when dismissed is said to be \"out\" and that means he must leave the field of play and be replaced by the next batsman on his team. When ten batsmen have been dismissed (i.e., are out), then the whole team is dismissed and the innings is over. The last batsman, the one who has not been dismissed, is not allowed to continue alone as there must always be two batsmen \"in\". This batsman is termed \"not out\".\n\nAn innings can end early for three reasons: because the batting side's captain has chosen to \"declare\" the innings closed (which is a tactical decision), or because the batting side has achieved its target and won the game, or because the game has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time. In each of these cases the team's innings ends with two \"not out\" batsmen, unless the innings is declared closed at the fall of a wicket and the next batsman has not joined in the play.\n\nIn limited overs cricket, there might be two batsmen still \"not out\" when the last of the allotted overs has been bowled.\n\nOvers\n\nThe bowler bowls the ball in sets of six deliveries (or \"balls\") and each set of six balls is called an over. This name came about because the umpire calls \"Over!\" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can bowl unchanged at the same end for several overs. The batsmen do not change ends and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at square leg now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa.\n\nTeam structure\n\nA team consists of eleven players. Depending on his or her primary skills, a player may be classified as a specialist batsman or bowler. A well-balanced team usually has five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers. Teams nearly always include a specialist wicket-keeper because of the importance of this fielding position. Each team is headed by a captain who is responsible for making tactical decisions such as determining the batting order, the placement of fielders and the rotation of bowlers.\n\nA player who excels in both batting and bowling is known as an all-rounder. One who excels as a batsman and wicket-keeper is known as a \"wicket-keeper/batsman\", sometimes regarded as a type of all-rounder. True all-rounders are rare as most players focus on either batting or bowling skills.\n\nBowling\n\nThe bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a \"run-up\", although some bowlers with a very slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. A fast bowler needs momentum and takes quite a long run-up, running very fast as he does so.\n\nThe fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 90 mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile. Some fast bowlers make use of the seam of the ball so that it \"curves\" or \"swings\" in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball touches the edge of the bat and can then be \"caught behind\" by the wicketkeeper or a slip fielder.\n\nAt the other end of the bowling scale is the \"spinner\" who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman. A spinner will often \"buy his wicket\" by \"tossing one up\" (in a slower, higher parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot. The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often \"flighted\" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be \"trapped\" into getting himself out.\n\nIn between the pacemen and the spinners are the \"medium pacers\" who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration.\n\nAll bowlers are classified according to their looks or style. The classifications, as with much cricket terminology, can be very confusing. Hence, a bowler could be classified as LF, meaning he is a left arm fast bowler; or as LBG, meaning he is a right arm spin bowler who bowls deliveries that are called a \"leg break\" and a \"Googly\".\n\nDuring the bowling action the elbow may be held at any angle and may bend further, but may not straighten out. If the elbow straightens illegally then the square-leg umpire may call no-ball: this is known as \"throwing\" or \"chucking\", and can be difficult to detect. The current laws allow a bowler to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less.\n\nFielding\n\nAll eleven players on the fielding side take the field together. One of them is the wicket-keeper aka \"keeper\" who operates behind the wicket being defended by the batsman on strike. Wicket-keeping is normally a specialist occupation and his primary job is to gather deliveries that the batsman does not hit, so that the batsmen cannot run byes. He wears special gloves (he is the only fielder allowed to do so), a box over the groin, and pads to cover his lower legs. Owing to his position directly behind the striker, the wicket-keeper has a good chance of getting a batsman out caught off a fine edge from the bat. He is the only player who can get a batsman out stumped.\n\nApart from the one currently bowling, the other nine fielders are tactically deployed by the team captain in chosen positions around the field. These positions are not fixed but they are known by specific and sometimes colourful names such as \"slip\", \"third man\", \"silly mid on\" and \"long leg\". There are always many unprotected areas.\n\nThe captain is the most important member of the fielding side as he determines all the tactics including who should bowl (and how); and he is responsible for \"setting the field\", though usually in consultation with the bowler.\n\nIn all forms of cricket, if a fielder gets injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him. The substitute cannot bowl, act as a captain or keep wicket. The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.\n\nBatting\n\nAt any one time, there are two batsmen in the playing area. One takes station at the striker's end to defend the wicket as above and to score runs if possible. His partner, the non-striker, is at the end where the bowler is operating.\n\nBatsmen come in to bat in a batting order, decided by the team captain. The first two batsmen - the \"openers\" - usually face the hostile bowling from fresh fast bowlers with a new ball. The top batting positions are usually given to the most competent batsmen in the team, and the team's bowlers - who are typically, but not always, less skilled as batsmen - typically bat last. The pre-announced batting order is not mandatory; when a wicket falls any player who has not yet batted may be sent in next.\n\nIf a batsman \"retires\" (usually due to injury) and cannot return, he is actually \"not out\" and his retirement does not count as a dismissal, though in effect he has been dismissed because his innings is over. Substitute batsmen are not allowed.\n\nA skilled batsman can use a wide array of \"shots\" or \"strokes\" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an \"edge\". Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply \"blocking\" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run.\n\nThere is a wide variety of shots played in cricket. The batsman's repertoire includes strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., \"cut\", \"drive\", \"hook\", \"pull\".\n\nA batsman is not required to play a shot; in the event that he believes the ball will not hit his wicket and there is no opportunity to score runs, he can \"leave\" the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. He can deliberately use his leg to block the ball and thereby \"pad it away\" but this is risky because of the leg before wicket rule.\n\nIn the event of an injured batsman being fit to bat but not to run, the umpires and the fielding captain were previously able to allow another member of the batting side to be a runner. The runner's only task was to run between the wickets instead of the incapacitated batsman, and he was required to wear and carry exactly the same equipment as the batsman. As of 2011 the ICC outlawed the use of runners as they felt this was being abused. \n\nRuns\n\nThe primary concern of the batsman on strike (i.e., the \"striker\") is to prevent the ball hitting the wicket and secondarily to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score.\n\nMore than one run can be scored from a single hit; but, while hits worth one to three runs are common, the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more. To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. The batsmen do not need to run if the ball reaches or crosses the boundary.\n\nHits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of \"overthrows\" by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.\n\nThe decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: \"yes\", \"no\" and \"wait\" are often heard.\n\nRunning is a calculated risk because if a fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman is out of his ground (i.e., he does not have part of his body or bat in contact with the ground behind the popping crease), the batsman is run out.\n\nA team's score is reported in terms of the number of runs scored and the number of batsmen that have been dismissed. For example, if five batsmen are out and the team has scored 224 runs, they are said to have scored 224 for the loss of 5 wickets (commonly shortened to \"224 for five\" and written 224/5 or, in Australia, \"five for 224\" and 5/224).\n\nExtras\n\nAdditional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called \"sundries\" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways:\n# No ball: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules of bowling either by (a) using an inappropriate arm action; (b) overstepping the popping crease; (c) having a foot outside the return crease. In addition, the bowler has to re-bowl the ball. In limited overs matches, a no ball is called if the bowling team's field setting fails to comply with the restrictions. In shorter formats of the game (20–20, ODI) the free hit rule has been introduced. The ball following a front foot no-ball will be a free-hit for the batsman, whereby he is safe from losing his wicket except for being run-out.\n# Wide: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach; as with a no ball, a wide must be re-bowled. If a wide ball crosses the boundary, five runs are awarded to the batting side (one run for the wide, and four for the boundary).\n# Bye: extra(s) awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicketkeeper to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way (note that one mark of a good wicketkeeper is one who restricts the tally of byes to a minimum).\n# Leg bye: extra(s) awarded if the ball hits the batsman's body, but not his bat, while attempting a legitimate shot, and it goes away from the fielders to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way.\n\nWhen the bowler has bowled a no ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball. The batsmen have to run (i.e., unless the ball goes to the boundary for four) to claim byes and leg byes but these only count towards the team total, not to the striker's individual total for which runs must be scored off the bat.\n\nDismissals\n\nThere are eleven ways in which a batsman can be dismissed; five relatively common and six extremely rare. The common forms of dismissal are \"bowled\", \"caught\", \"leg before wicket\" (lbw), \"run out\", and \"stumped\". Less common methods are \"hit wicket\", \"hit the ball twice\", \"obstructed the field\", \"handled the ball\" and \"timed out\" - these are almost unknown in the professional game. The eleventh – retired out – is not treated as an on-field dismissal but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.\n\nIf the dismissal is obvious (for example when \"bowled\" and in most cases of \"caught\") the batsman will voluntarily leave the field without the umpire needing to dismiss them. Otherwise before the umpire will award a dismissal and declare the batsman to be out, a member of the fielding side (generally the bowler) must \"appeal\". This is invariably done by asking (or shouting) \"how's that?\" - normally reduced to howzat? If the umpire agrees with the appeal, he will raise a forefinger and say \"Out!\". Otherwise he will shake his head and say \"Not out\". Appeals are particularly loud when the circumstances of the claimed dismissal are unclear, as is always the case with lbw and often with run outs and stumpings.\n\n# Bowled: the bowler has hit the wicket with the delivery and the wicket has \"broken\" with at least one bail being dislodged (note that if the ball hits the wicket without dislodging a bail it is not out). \n# Caught: the batsman has hit the ball with his bat, or with his hand which was holding the bat, and the ball has been caught before it has touched the ground by a member of the fielding side. \n# Leg before wicket (lbw): the ball has hit the batsman's body (including his clothing, pads etc. but not the bat, or a hand holding the bat) when it would have gone on to hit the stumps. This rule exists mainly to prevent the batsman from guarding his wicket with his legs instead of the bat. To be given out lbw, the ball must not bounce outside leg stump or strike the batsmen outside the line of leg-stump. It may bounce outside off-stump. The batsman may only be dismissed lbw by a ball striking him outside the line of off-stump if he has not made a genuine attempt to play the ball with his bat. \n# Run out: a member of the fielding side has broken or \"put down\" the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman was out of his ground; this usually occurs by means of an accurate throw to the wicket while the batsmen are attempting a run, although a batsman can be given out Run out even when he is not attempting a run; he merely needs to be out of his ground. \n# Stumped is similar except that it is done by the wicketkeeper after the batsman has missed the bowled ball and has stepped out of his ground, and is not attempting a run.  A batsman can be run out on a No ball, but cannot be stumped.\n# Hit wicket: a batsman is out hit wicket if he dislodges one or both bails with his bat, person, clothing or equipment in the act of receiving a ball, or in setting off for a run having just received a ball. \n# Hit the ball twice is very unusual and was introduced as a safety measure to counter dangerous play and protect the fielders. The batsman may legally play the ball a second time only to stop the ball hitting the wicket after he has already played it. \"Hit\" does not necessarily refer to the batsman's bat. \n# Obstructing the field: another unusual dismissal which tends to involve a batsman deliberately getting in the way (physically and/or verbally) of a fielder. \n# Handled the ball: a batsman must not deliberately touch the ball with his hand, for example to protect his wicket. Note that the batsman's hand or glove counts as part of the bat while the hand is holding the bat, so batsmen are frequently caught off their gloves (i.e. the ball hits, and is deflected by, the glove and can then be caught). \n# Timed out; means that the next batsman was not ready to receive a delivery within three minutes of the previous one being dismissed. \n#Retired out: a batsman retires without the umpire's permission, and does not have the permission of the opposition captain to resume their innings. \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, it is the striker who is out when a dismissal occurs. If the non-striker is dismissed it is usually by being run out, but he could also be dismissed for obstructing the field, handling the ball or being timed out.\n\nA batsman may leave the field without being dismissed. If injured or taken ill the batsman may temporarily retire, and be replaced by the next batsman. This is recorded as retired hurt or retired ill. The retiring batsman is not out, and may resume the innings later. An unimpaired batsman may retire, and this is treated as being dismissed retired out; no player is credited with the dismissal. Batsmen cannot be out bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped or hit wicket off a no ball. They cannot be out bowled, caught, leg before wicket, or hit the ball twice off a wide. Some of these modes of dismissal can occur without the bowler bowling a delivery. The batsman who is not on strike may be run out by the bowler if he leaves his crease before the bowler bowls, and a batsman can be out obstructing the field or retired out at any time. Timed out is, by its nature, a dismissal without a delivery. With all other modes of dismissal, only one batsman can be dismissed per ball bowled.\n\nInnings closed\n\nAn innings is closed when:\n# Ten of the eleven batsmen are out (have been dismissed); in this case, the team is said to be \"all out\"\n# The team has only one batsman left who can bat, one or more of the remaining players being unavailable owing to injury, illness or absence; again, the team is said to be \"all out\"\n# The team batting last reaches the score required to win the match\n# The predetermined number of overs has been bowled (in a one-day match only, commonly 50 overs; or 20 in Twenty20)\n# A captain declares his team's innings closed while at least two of his batsmen are not out (this does not apply in one-day limited over matches)\n\nResults\n\nIf the team that bats last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, the team is said to have \"lost by n runs\" (where n is the difference between the number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have \"won by n wickets\", where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For instance a team that passes its opponents' score having only lost six wickets would have won \"by four wickets\".\n\nIn a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have won by an innings and n runs, and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores.\n\nIf the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side. In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw.\n\nIf the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of deliveries for each innings is often imposed. Such a match is called a \"limited overs\" or \"one-day\" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth-Lewis method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a \"no-result\" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.\n\nDistinctive elements\n\nIndividual focus\n\nFor a team sport, cricket places individual players under unusual scrutiny and pressure. Bowler, batsman, and fielder all act essentially independently of each other. While team managements can signal bowler or batsman to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is slightly mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for a long time.\n\nSpirit of the Game\n\nCricket is a unique game where in addition to the laws, the players must abide by the \"Spirit of the Game\".  The standard of sportsmanship has historically been considered so high that the phrase \"it's just not cricket\" was coined in the 19th century to describe unfair or underhanded behaviour in any walk of life. In the last few decades though, cricket has become increasingly fast-paced and competitive, increasing the use of appealing and sledging, although players are still expected to abide by the umpires' rulings without argument, and for the most part they do. Beginning in 2001, the MCC has held an annual lecture named after Colin Cowdrey on the spirit of the game.  Even in the modern game fielders are known to signal to the umpire that a boundary was hit, despite what could have been considered a spectacular save (though they might be found out by the TV replays anyway). In addition to this, some batsmen have been known to \"walk\" when they think they are out even if the umpire does not declare them out. This is a high level of sportsmanship, as a batsman can easily take advantage of incorrect umpiring decisions.\n\nInfluence of weather\n\nCricket is a sport played predominantly in the drier periods of the year. But, even so, the weather is a major factor in all cricket matches.\n\nA scheduled game of cricket cannot be played in wet weather. Dampness affects the bounce of the ball on the wicket and is a risk to all players involved in the game. Many grounds have facilities to cover the cricket pitch (or the wicket). Covers can be in the form of tarpaulins being laid over the wicket, elevated covers on wheels (acting like an umbrella) or even hover covers which form an airtight seal around the wicket. However, most grounds do not have the facilities to cover the outfield. This means that in the event of heavy bouts of bad weather, games may be cancelled, abandoned or suspended due to an unsafe outfield.\n\nAnother factor in cricket is the amount of light available. At grounds without floodlights (or in game formats which disallow the use of floodlights), umpires can stop play in the event of bad light as it becomes too difficult for the batsmen to be able to see the ball coming at them, (and in extreme cases, members of the fielding team).\n\nOn the other hand, in instances of good light, batsmen can use sight-screens which enable batsmen to have a white background against which they can pick out the red ball (or black background for white ball) with greater ease.\n\nThe umpires always have the final decision on weather-related issues.\n\nUniqueness of each field\n\nUnlike those of most sports, cricket playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the pitch and infield are specifically regulated, the Laws of Cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field. The field boundaries are sometimes painted and sometimes marked by a rope. Pitch and outfield variations can have a significant effect on how balls behave and are fielded as well as on batting. Pitches vary in consistency, and thus in the amount of bounce, spin, and seam movement available to the bowler. Hard pitches are usually good to bat on because of high but even bounce. Dry pitches tend to deteriorate for batting as cracks often appear, and when this happens to the pitch, spinners can play a major role. Damp pitches, or pitches covered in grass (termed \"green\" pitches), allow good fast bowlers to extract extra bounce. Such pitches tend to offer help to fast bowlers throughout the match, but become better for batting as the game goes on. While players of other outdoor sports deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardised. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ground. A given ground may acquire a reputation as batsman friendly or bowler friendly if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The absence of a standardised field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team makeup and players' statistical records.\n\nTypes of matches\n\nCricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats, varying playing standard and level of formality and the desired time that the match should last. A pertinent division in terms of professional cricket is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece, and those limited by number of overs, in which they have a single innings each. The former, known as first-class cricket, has a duration of three to five days (there have been examples of \"timeless\" matches too); the latter, known as limited overs cricket because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 or 20 overs, has a planned duration of one day only (a match can be extended if necessary due to bad weather, etc.).\n\nTypically, two-innings matches have at least six hours of playing time each day. Limited overs matches often last six hours or more. There are usually formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea with brief informal breaks for drinks. There is also a short interval between innings.\n\nAmateur cricketers rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided into declaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares; and limited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually. These will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the ever popular 20 over format during the evenings. Other forms of cricket, such as indoor cricket and garden cricket remain popular.\n\nHistorically, a form of cricket known as single wicket had been extremely successful and many of these contests in the 18th and 19th centuries qualify as major cricket matches. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began.\n\nTest cricket\n\nTest cricket is the highest standard of first-class cricket. A Test match is an international fixture between teams representing those countries that are Full Members of the ICC.\n\nAlthough the term \"Test match\" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–77 Australian season. Subsequently, eight other national teams have achieved Test status: South Africa (1889), West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1929), India (1932), Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992) and Bangladesh (2000). Zimbabwe suspended its Test status in 2006 due to its inability to compete against other Test teams,  and returned in 2011. \n\nWelsh players are eligible to play for England, which is in effect an England and Wales team. The West Indies team comprises players from numerous states in the Caribbean, notably Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago, the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands.\n\nTest matches between two teams are usually played in a group of matches called a \"series\". Matches last up to five days and a series normally consists of three to five matches. Test matches that are not finished within the allotted time are drawn. In the case of Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. \n\nSince 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes. Some other bilateral series have individual trophies too: for example, the Wisden Trophy is contested by England and West Indies; the Frank Worrell Trophy by Australia and West Indies and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia.\n\nLimited overs\n\nStandard limited overs cricket was introduced in England in the 1963 season in the form of a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other major cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England. Limited overs cricket has seen various innovations including the use of multi-coloured kit and floodlit matches using a white ball.\nA \"one day match\", named so because each match is scheduled for completion in a single day, is the common form of limited overs cricket played on an international level. In practice, matches sometimes continue on a second day if they have been interrupted or postponed by bad weather. The main objective of a limited overs match is to produce a definite result and so a conventional draw is not possible, but matches can be undecided if the scores are tied or if bad weather prevents a result. Each team plays one innings only and faces a limited number of overs, usually a maximum of 50. The Cricket World Cup is held in one day format and the last World Cup in 2015 was won by the co-hosts, Australia. The next World Cup will be hosted by England and Wales in 2019.\n\nTwenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session. The original idea, when the concept was introduced in England in 2003, was to provide workers with an evening entertainment. It was commercially successful and has been adopted internationally. The inaugural Twenty20 World Championship was held in 2007 and won by India. Subsequent events have been held which were won by Pakistan (2009), England (2010), West Indies (2012), and Sri Lanka (2014). The next tournament is scheduled to be held in 2016. After the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 many domestic Twenty20 leagues were born. First of them was Indian Cricket League which was a rebel league since it was not authorized by BCCI. BCCI then formed its official league called the Indian Premier League. The official league went on to become a successful annual affair that attracted players and audience around the globe, while the Indian Cricket League has been disbanded. After the success of Indian premier league many other domestic leagues were formed in all major cricketing nations. Recently Twenty20 Champions League was formed as a tournament for domestic clubs of various countries. In this league competition is between the top domestic teams from major cricketing nations.\n\nNational championships\n\nFirst-class cricket includes Test cricket but the term is generally used to refer to the highest level of domestic cricket in those countries with full ICC membership, although there are exceptions to this. First-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the County Championship. The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890. The most successful club has been Yorkshire County Cricket Club with 30 official titles.\n\nAustralia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the Sheffield Shield was introduced. In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states. New South Wales has won the maximum number of titles with 45 to 2008.\n\nNational championship trophies to be established elsewhere included the Ranji Trophy (India), Plunket Shield (New Zealand), Currie Cup (South Africa) and Shell Shield (West Indies). Some of these competitions have been updated and renamed in recent years.\n\nDomestic limited overs competitions began with England's Gillette Cup knockout in 1963. Countries usually stage seasonal limited overs competitions in both knockout and league format. In recent years, national Twenty20 competitions have been introduced, usually in knockout form though some incorporate mini-leagues.\n\nClub cricket\n\nClub cricket is a mainly amateur, but still formal, form of the sport of cricket, usually involving teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening. There is a great deal of variation in game format although the Laws of Cricket are always observed.\n\nClub cricket is frequently organised in a league or cup format. Games are limited by either time or overs. Limited overs games usually last between 20 and 60 overs per innings. A less common, but more traditional, format is limiting the game by time only. Games can range from a few hours in the evening to two days long. A modern innovation is the introduction of Twenty20 competitions, both as a format in the existing leagues and new leagues solely based on Twenty20, such as LastManStanding.\n\nStandards of play can vary from semi-professional to occasional recreational level and club cricket is often enjoyed as much for the social element as for the competition. Most clubs have their own ground to play on regularly, often including a field and pavilion or club house. An exception being 'Wandering Sides' who use other's grounds.\n\nMany leagues have been formed around the world of varying degrees of professionalism, the oldest being the Birmingham & District Premier League in the Birmingham area of England, founded in 1888.\n\nOther types of matches\n\nThere are numerous variations of the sport played throughout the world that include indoor cricket, French cricket, beach cricket, Kwik cricket and all sorts of card games and board games that have been inspired by cricket. In these variants, the rules are often changed to make the game playable with limited resources or to render it more convenient and enjoyable for the participants.\n\nIndoor Cricket was first invented in 1970.  It is similar to outdoor cricket except that is played in an indoor sports hall with 6 players per team. It is extremely popular in the UK with national championships and multiple independent leagues. Another less formal version of indoor cricket is played in a smaller arena with a soft ball and without pads was invented some years later and is commonly played in the Southern Hemisphere, and even has its own nominal international championships, including World Cups.\n\nIn the UK, garden cricket is a popular version of the sport, played in gardens and on recreation grounds around the country by adults and children alike. Although a cricket bat and ball are generally used, other equipment such as pads and gloves are not. The exact rules will vary based on the number of participants and the available space.\n\nFamilies and teenagers play backyard cricket or tennis ball cricket in suburban yards or driveways, and the cities of India and Pakistan play host to countless games of \"Gully Cricket\" or \"tape ball\" in their long narrow streets. Sometimes the rules are improvised: e.g. it may be agreed that fielders can catch the ball with one hand after one bounce and claim a wicket; or if only a few people are available then everyone may field while the players take it in turns to bat and bowl. Tennis balls and homemade bats are often used, and a variety of objects may serve as wickets: for example, the batter's legs as in French cricket, which did not in fact originate in France, and is usually played by small children.\n\nIn Kwik cricket, the bowler does not have to wait for the batsman to be ready before a delivery, leading to a faster, more exhausting game designed to appeal to children, which is often used in physical education lessons at UK schools. Another modification to increase the pace of the game is the \"Tip and Run\", \"Tipity\" Run, \"Tipsy Run\" or \"Tippy-Go\" rule, in which the batter must run when the ball touches the bat, even if it the contact is unintentional or minor. This rule, seen only in impromptu games, speeds the match up by removing the batsman's right to block the ball.\n\nIn Samoa a form of cricket called Kilikiti is played in which hockey stick-shaped bats are used. In original English cricket, the hockey stick shape was replaced by the modern straight bat in the 1760s after bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it. In Estonia, teams gather over the winter for the annual Ice Cricket tournament. The game juxtaposes the normal summer pursuit with harsh, wintry conditions. Rules are otherwise similar to those for the six-a-side game.\n\nInternational structure\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the international governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989.\n\nThe ICC has 104 members: 10 Full Members that play official Test matches, 34 Associate Members, and 60 Affiliate Members.  The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals. Each nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country. The cricket board also selects the national squad and organises home and away tours for the national team. In the West Indies these matters are addressed by the West Indies Cricket Board which consists of members appointed by four national boards and two multi-national boards.\n\nMembers\n\nFull Members\n\nFull Members are the governing bodies for cricket in a country or associated countries. Full Members may also represent a geographical area. All Full Members have a right to send one representative team to play official Test matches. Also, all Full Member nations are automatically qualified to play ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals. West Indies cricket team does not represent one country instead an amalgamation of over 20 countries from the Caribbean. The English Cricket team represents both England and Wales.\n\n*Last Updated: 9 February 2016  \n\nAResigned May 1961, readmitted 10 July 1991.\n\nTop Associate and Affiliate Members\n\nAll the associate and affiliate members are not qualified to play Test Cricket, however ICC grants One Day International status to its associate and affiliate members based on their success in the World Cricket League. The top six teams will be awarded One day international and Twenty20 International status, which will allow the associate and affiliate teams to be eligible to play the full members and play official ODI cricket.\n\nThe associate and affiliate teams who currently hold ODI and T20I status:\n\nCricket at international multi-sport events\n\nCricket was played as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics, when England and France contested a two-day match.  In 1998, cricket was played as part of the Commonwealth Games, on this occasion in the 50-over format. There was some talk about Twenty20 cricket being part of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, which were held in Delhi, but at the time the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), were not in favour of the short format of the game, and it was not included.  \n\nCricket was played in 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China  and 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.  India skipped both times.  There was further calls for subsequent Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games. The Commonwealth Games Federation asked the ICC to participate in the 2014 and 2018 Commonwealth Games, but the ICC turned down the invitation.  In 2010, the International Olympic Committee recognised cricket as a sport which could apply to be included in the Olympic Games,  but in 2013 the ICC announced that it had no intentions to make such an application, primarily due to opposition from the  BCCI. ESPNcricinfo suggested that the opposition might be based on the possible loss of income.  In April 2016, ICC chief executive Dave Richardson said that Twenty20 cricket can have a chance of getting in for the 2024 Summer Games, but there must be collective support shown by the ICC's membership base, in particular from BCCI, in order for there to be a chance of inclusion. \n\nStatistics\n\nOrganized cricket lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. At the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, one-day internationals, and first-class cricket are recorded separately. However, since Test matches are a form of first-class cricket, a player's first-class statistics will include his Test match statistics - but not vice versa. The Guide to Cricketers was a cricket annual edited by Fred Lillywhite between 1849 and his death in 1866. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was founded in 1864 by the English cricketer John Wisden (1826–1884) as a competitor to The Guide to Cricketers. Its annual publication has continued uninterrupted to the present day, making it the longest running sports annual in history.\n\nCertain traditional statistics are familiar to most cricket fans. The basic batting statistics include:\n* Innings (I): The number of innings in which the batsman actually batted.\n* Not outs (NO): The number of times the batsman was not out at the conclusion of an innings they batted in.\n* Runs (R): The number of runs scored.\n* Highest score (HS/Best): The highest score ever made by the batsman.\n* Batting average (Ave): The total number of runs divided by the total number of innings in which the batsman was out. Ave = Runs/[I - NO] (also Avge or Avg.)\n* Centuries (100): The number of innings in which the batsman scored one hundred runs or more.\n* Half-centuries (50): The number of innings in which the batsman scored fifty to ninety-nine runs (centuries do not count as half-centuries as well).\n* Balls faced (BF): The total number of balls received, including no balls but not including wides.\n* Strike rate (SR): The number of runs scored per 100 balls faced. (SR = [100 * Runs]/BF)\n* Run rate (RR): Is the number of runs a batsman (or the batting side) scores in an over of six balls.\n\nThe basic bowling statistics include:\n* Overs (O): The number of overs bowled.\n* Balls (B): The number of balls bowled. Overs is more traditional, but balls is a more useful statistic because the number of balls per over has varied historically.\n* Maiden overs (M): The number of maiden overs (overs in which the bowler conceded zero runs) bowled.\n* Runs (R): The number of runs conceded.\n* Wickets (W): The number of wickets taken.\n* No balls (Nb): The number of no balls bowled.\n* Wides (Wd): The number of wides bowled.\n* Bowling average (Ave): The average number of runs conceded per wicket. (Ave = Runs/W)\n* Strike rate (SR): The average number of balls bowled per wicket. (SR = Balls/W)\n* Economy rate (Econ): The average number of runs conceded per over. (Econ = Runs/overs bowled).\n\nScorecards\n\nA match's statistics are summarised on a scorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks. The earliest known scorecards were printed in 1776 by Pratt, scorer to the Sevenoaks Vine Cricket Club, but it was many years before his invention was widely adopted.  Scorecards were printed and sold at Lord's for the first time in 1846. \n\nThe introduction of scoreboards revolutionised cricket by allowing spectators to keep track of the day's play. In 1848, Fred Lillywhite used a portable printing press at grounds to print updated scorecards. In 1858, the Kennington Oval introduced the first mobile scorebox, \"a house on rollers with figures for telegraphing on each side\". In 1881, the Melbourne Cricket Ground erected the first cricket scoreboard. The scoreboard, located at the western end of the ground, gave the batsman's name and method of dismissal.\n\nCulture\n\nInfluence on everyday life\n\nCricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere. Cricket has had an influence on the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with such phrases as \"that's not cricket\" (unfair), \"had a good innings\", \"sticky wicket\", and \"bowled over\". There have been many cricket films. The term \"Bradmanesque\" from Don Bradman's name has become a generic term for outstanding excellence, both within cricket and in the wider world. \n\nThe amateur game has also been spread further afield by expatriates from the Test-playing nations.\n\nIn the arts and popular culture\n\nCricket is the subject of works by major English poets including William Blake and Lord Byron.Smart, Alastair (20 July 2013). [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/10191131/The-art-of-cricket-Enough-to-leave-you-stumped.html \"The art of cricket: Enough to leave you stumped\"], The Telegraph. Retrieved 12 March 2016. Beyond a Boundary (1963), written by Trinidadian C.L.R. James, is often named the best book on any sport, ever written.  In fiction, there is English author P. G. Wodehouse's 1909 novel, Mike.\n\nIn the visual arts, notable cricket paintings include Albert Chevallier Tayler's Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury (1907) and Russell Drysdale's The Cricketers (1948), which has been called \"possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century.\"  French impressionist Camille Pissarro painted cricket on a visit to England in the 1890s. Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batsman in motion. Caribbean artist Wendy Nanan’s cricket images  are featured in a limited edition first day cover for Royal Mail's \"World of Invention\" stamp issue,  celebrating the London Cricket Conference 1–3 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the celebrations leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup. \n\nThere are many cricket video games, including EA Sports Cricket 07.\n\nInfluence on other sports\n\nCricket has close historical ties with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports.  In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with \"a code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season. The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game.  It is typically played on modified cricket fields.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was responsible for the \"development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball\". The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick came to be known as Father of Baseball, and was an early inductee in the Baseball Hall of Fame."

                "Coney Island is a peninsular residential neighborhood, beach, and leisure/entertainment destination on the Coney Island Channel, which is part of the Lower Bay in the southwestern part of the borough of Brooklyn, New York City. The site was formerly an outer barrier island but became partially connected to the rest of Long Island by land fill. The residential portion of the peninsula is a community of 60,000 people in its western part, with Sea Gate to its west, Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach to its east, the Lower Bay to the south, and Gravesend to the north.\n\nConey Island is well known as the site of amusement parks and a seaside resort. The attractions reached a historical peak during the first half of the 20th century, declining in popularity after World War II and years of neglect. In recent years, the area has seen the opening of MCU Park stadium and has become home to the Brooklyn Cyclones minor league baseball team, as well as the opening of a new amusement park among several adjacent ones.\n__TOC__\n\nGeography\n\nConey Island is the westernmost part of the barrier islands of Long Island, and is about 4 mi long and  wide lying between Sheepshead Bay to the east and Lower New York Bay to the west. It was formerly an island that was separated from the main part of Brooklyn by Coney Island Creek, a partial tidal mudflats, but it has since been developed into a peninsula. There were plans early in the 20th century to dredge and straighten the creek as a ship canal, but they were abandoned, and the center of the creek was filled in completely to allow construction of the Belt Parkway before World War II, and it was filled in again in 1962 with the construction of the Verrazano–Narrows Bridge.  The western and eastern ends of the island are now peninsulas.\n\nHistory\n\nSettlement and name\n\nThe original Native American inhabitants of the region were the Lenape, who called the island Narrioch. This name has been attributed the meaning of \"land without shadows\"  or \"always in light\"  describing how its south facing beaches always remained in sunlight. A second meaning attributed to Narrioch is \"point\" or \"corner of land\".   The Dutch established the colony of Nieuw Amsterdam in that area in the early 17th century. The Native American population in the area dwindled as the Dutch settlement grew and the entire southwest section of what was to become Brooklyn was purchased from an elder in 1645 for a gun, a blanket and a kettle.,  \n\nThere is no clear historical consensus on how the island got the name \"Coney Island\". A Robert Morden map from 1690 has the label \"Conney Iſle\"  and the name appears on an 1733 map (\"Coney Iſland\")  and an 1811 map (\"Coney I\").  The most popular theory is the name came from the old spelling of the Dutch word for rabbit, \"conyn\", derived from a purported large population of wild rabbits, giving it the name \"Conyne Eylandt\" (\"Rabbits Island\"),   with the name being anglicized to \"Coney Island\" after the English took over the colony in 1664, \"coney\" being the English version of the word rabbit. Other origins of the name include that it came from the name of the native american tribe, the Konoh, who supposedly once inhabited it, or the name \"Conyn\" which appears in a 1816 work on New York place names, believed to be the surname of a family of Dutch settlers who lived there.\n\nSome of the alternative theories on how the island got its name include the Irish Gaelic name for rabbit which is Coinín, which is also anglicized to Coney. Ireland has many islands named Coney Island, all of which predate this one. Another theory has an Irish captain named Peter O'Connor naming Coney Island in the 18th century, after an island in Sligo Bay known as both Coney Island and Inishmulclohy. Another purported origin is that the island is named after Henry Hudson's right-hand-man, John Coleman, supposed to have been slain by Indians.\n\nDevelopment\n\nDevelopment on Coney Island has always been controversial. When the first structures were built around the 1840s, there was an outcry to prevent any development on the island and preserve it as a natural park. Starting in the early 1900s, the City of New York made efforts to condemn all buildings and piers built south of Surf Avenue. It was an effort to reclaim the beach which by then had almost completely been built over with bath houses, clam bars, amusements, and other structures. The local amusement community opposed the city. Eventually a settlement was reached where the beach did not begin until 1000 ft south of Surf Avenue, the territory marked by a city-owned boardwalk, while the city would demolish any structures that had been built over public streets, to reclaim beach access.\n\nHotel era\n\nConey Island started to become a resort area after the Coney Island Hotel was finished in 1829.  Due to Coney Island's proximity to Manhattan and other boroughs, and its simultaneous relative distance from the city of Brooklyn to provide the illusion of a proper vacation, it began attracting vacationers in the 1830s and 1840s, assisted by carriage roads and steamship service that reduced travel time from a formerly half-day journey to two hours.  Most of the vacationers were wealthy and went by carriage. Inventor Samuel Colt built an observation tower on the peninsula in 1845, but he abandoned the project soon after. In 1847, the middle class started going to Coney Island upon the introduction of a ferry line to Norton's Point—named after hotel owner Michael Norton—at the western portion of the peninsula. Gang activity started as well, with one 1870s writer noting that going to Coney Island could result in losing money and even lives.\n\nIn 1868, William A. Engeman built a resort in the area. The resort was given the name \"Brighton Beach\" in 1878 by Henry C. Murphy and a group of businessmen, who chose to name as an allusion to the English resort city of Brighton.  With the help of Gravesend’s surveyor William Stillwell, Engeman acquired all 39 lots for $20,000, a \"bargain price.\"  This 460 by hotel, with rooms for up to 5,000 people nightly and meals for up to 20,000 people daily, was close to the then-rundown western Coney Island, so it was mostly the upper middle class that went to this hotel. The 400 ft, double-decker Brighton Beach Pavilion was also built nearby. \"Hotel Brighton\" (or Brighton Beach Hotel) was situated on the beach at what is now the foot of Coney Island Avenue,  and was accessed by the Brooklyn, Flatbush, and Coney Island Railway (the present-day BMT Brighton Line), which opened on July 2, 1878. \n\nSimultaneously, wealthy banker August Corbin was developing adjacent Manhattan Beach after being interested in the area during a trip to the beach to heal his sick son.  Corbin, who worked on Wall Street and had many railroad investments, built the New York and Manhattan Beach Railway for his two luxury shoreline hotels. These hotels were used by the wealthy upper class, who would not go to Brighton Beach because of its proximity to Coney Island. The J. Pickering Putnam-designed, 150-room Manhattan Beach Hotel, with restaurants, ballrooms, and shops, was open for business by 1877 at a ceremony presided over by Ulysses S. Grant. In 1880, the similarly prodigal Oriental Hotel, which hosted rooms for wealthy families staying for extended periods, opened.\n\nAndrew R. Culver, president of the Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad (the present-day IND Culver Line)  had built a steam railway, the Culver Line, before Corbin and Engeman had even built their railroads. For 35 cents, one could ride the Prospect Park & Coney Island Railroad to the Surf Avenue terminal. Across the street from the terminal, the 300 ft Iron Tower, bought from the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition, provided patrons with a bird's-eye view of the coast. The nearby \"Camera Obscura\" similarly used mirrors and lens to provide a panoramic view of the area. Coney Island became a major resort destination after the Civil War as excursion railroads and the Coney Island & Brooklyn Railroad streetcar line reached the area in the 1860s, and the Iron steamboat company in 1881.\n\nThe 150-suite Cable Hotel was built nearby in 1875. Next to it, on a 12 acre piece of land leased by James Voorhies, maitre d' Paul Bauer built the western peninsula's largest hotel, which opened in 1876. By the turn of the century, Victorian hotels, private bathhouses, and vaudeville theaters were a common sight on Coney island.\n \n\nTheme park era\n\nBetween about 1880 and World War II, Coney Island was the largest amusement area in the United States, attracting several million visitors per year. At its height, it contained three competing major amusement parks, Luna Park, Dreamland, and Steeplechase Park, as well as many independent amusements. The area was also the center of new technological events, with electric lights, roller coasters, and baby incubators among the innovations at Coney Island in the 1900s. This continued through the end of World War II, with world's fair-style structures such as the Parachute Jump and Wonder Wheel.\n\nCharles I. D. Looff, a Danish woodcarver, built the first carousel and amusement ride at Coney Island in 1876.  It was installed at Vandeveer's bath-house complex at West 6th Street and Surf Avenue. The complex was later called Balmer's Pavilion. The carousel consisted of hand-carved horses and animals standing two abreast. Two musicians, a drummer and a flute player, provided the music. A metal ring-arm hung on a pole outside the ride, feeding small, iron rings for eager riders to grab. A tent-top protected the riders from the weather. The fare was five cents.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1896, the Elephantine Colossus, a seven story building in the shape of an elephant, was the first sight to greet immigrants arriving in New York, who would see it before they saw the Statue of Liberty. The Coney Island \"Funny Face\" logo, which is still extant, dates 100 years to the early days of George C. Tilyou's Steeplechase Park. \n\nWhen the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company electrified the steam railroads and connected Brooklyn to Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge at the beginning of the 20th century, Coney Island turned rapidly from a resort to an accessible location for day-trippers seeking to escape the summer heat in New York City's tenements.  In 1915, the Sea Beach Line was upgraded to a subway line, followed by the other former excursion roads, and the opening of the New West End Terminal in 1919 ushered in Coney Island's busiest era.\n\nSince the 1920s, all property north of the boardwalk and south of Surf Avenue was zoned for amusement and recreational use only, with some large lots of property north of Surf also zoned for amusements only.\n\nRobert Moses era\n\nIn 1944, Luna Park was damaged by fire, and sold to a company who announced they were going to tear down what was left of Luna Park and build apartments. Robert Moses had the land rezoned for residential use with the proviso that the apartment complex include low-income housing.\n\nAfter World War II, contraction began seriously from a series of pressures. Air conditioning in movie theaters and then in homes, along with the advent of automobiles, which provided access to the less crowded and more appealing Long Island state parks, especially Jones Beach, lessened the attractions of Coney's beaches. Luna Park closed in 1946 after a series of fires and the street gang problems of the 1950s spilled into Coney Island. The presence of threatening youths did not impact the beachgoing but discouraged visitors to the rides and concessions, staples of the Coney Island economy. The local economy was particularly impacted by the 1964 closing of Steeplechase Park.\n\nIn 1949, Moses moved the boardwalk back from the beach several yards, demolishing many structures, including the city's municipal bath house. He would later demolish several blocks of amusements  to clear land for both the New York Aquarium  and the Abe Stark Rink.  Critics complained that Moses took three times more land than each structure needed, surrounding each with vacant lots that were of no use to the city. Four years later, Moses had the entire peninsula rezoned for residential use only and announced plans to demolish the amusements to make room for public housing. After many public complaints, the Estimate Board reinstated the area between West 22nd Street and The Cyclone as amusement only and threw in 100 ft of property north of Surf Av. between these streets. It has since then been protected for amusement use only, which has led to many public land battles.\n\nFred Trump era\n\nIn 1964, Coney Island's last remaining large theme park, Steeplechase Park, closed. The rides were auctioned off, and the property was sold to developer Fred Trump, the father of Donald Trump. Trump, convinced that the amusement area would die off once the large theme parks were gone, wanted to build luxury apartments on the old Steeplechase property. He spent ten years battling in court to get the property rezoned. At one point Trump organized a funeral for amusement parks in Coney Island. Trump invited the press to the funeral where bikini-clad girls first handed out hot dogs, then handed out stones which Fred invited all to cast through the stained-glass windows of the pavilion. Then, pronouncing the amusement park dead, he had the pavilion bulldozed. After a decade of court battles, Trump exhausted all his legal options and the property was still zoned only for amusements. He eventually leased the property to Norman Kaufman, who ran a small collection of fairground amusements on a corner of the site, calling his amusement park \"Steeplechase Park\".\n\nBetween the loss of both Luna Park and the original Steeplechase Park, as well as an urban-renewal plan that took place in the surrounding neighborhood where middle class houses were replaced with housing projects, fewer people visited Coney Island. With attendance dropping, many amusement owners abandoned their properties. In the late 1970s, the city came up with a plan to revitalize Coney Island by bringing in gambling casinos, as had been done in Atlantic City. The city's plans backfired when the prospect of selling property to rich casino owners created a land boom where property was bought up and the rides cleared in preparation of reselling to developers. Gambling was never legalized for Coney, and the area ended up with vacant lots.\n\nBy the 1970s, the area was in dispute. The city was considering demolishing the Cyclone in favor of an extension of the adjacent New York Aquarium. In 1979, the city purchased Steeplechase Park from Fred Trump and proceeded to evict Norman Kaufman's amusements. By this time, Kaufman had expanded his park and had plans to eventually rebuild the historic Steeplechase Park. He had even bought back the original Steeplechase horse ride with plans to install it the following season. But the city decided it did not want to wait decades for Steeplechase park to be rebuilt and believed it could attract a developer to build a large combination theme park and casino on the site. The property remained vacant for another five years.\n\nBullard deal and demolition of Thunderbolt\n\nIn the mid-1980s, businessman Horace Bullard approached the city to allow him to rebuild Steeplechase Park. He had already bought several acres of property just east of the Steeplechase Park site, including the property with a large coaster called Thunderbolt and property west of Abe Stark rink. His plans called for the combination of his property as well as the Steeplechase property and the unused property on the Abe Stark site as a multimillion-dollar theme park based on the original. The city agreed, and it and the state legislature approved the project in 1986. However, several bureaucrats held up the project for another two years while the NYC Planning Commission compiled an environmental impact report. In 1987, state senator Thomas Bartosiewics attempted to block Bullard from building on the Steeplechase site. Bartosiewics was part of a group called The Brooklyn Sports Foundation which had promised another theme park developer, Sportsplex, the right to build on the site. Construction was held up for another four years as Bullard and Sportsplex fought over the site.\n\nIn 1994, after Rudy Giuliani took office as mayor of New York, he negated the Bullard deal by building a baseball stadium on the site allotted for Steeplechase Park. Giuliani stated that he wanted to build Sportsplex, provided that it included a stadium for a minor-league team owned by the Mets; however, when Giuliani ordered the stadium to be built first, Sportsplex accused the city of planning to build a parking lot on the property earmarked for the Sportsplex construction. Giuliani publicly denied this and promised Sportsplex could begin construction the moment the stadium was finished. By doing this, Giuliani wanted to improve sports facilities in the area, as well as found a professional baseball team in Brooklyn (which had not hosted such a team since 1957, when the Brooklyn Dodgers—now the Los Angeles Dodgers—moved to Los Angeles). \n\nAs soon as the stadium was completed, Giuliani nullified the Sportsplex deal and had the parking lot built, angering many in the community.  The Mets decided the minor league team would be called the Brooklyn Cyclones and sold the naming rights to the stadium to Keyspan Energy. Executives from Keyspan complained that the stadium's line of view from the rest of Coney Island amusement area was blocked by the now derelict Thunderbolt coaster and considered not going through with the deal. Bullard, now no longer rebuilding Steeplechase Park, had wanted to restore the Thunderbolt as part of a scaled-down amusement park. The following month in \"an early-morning raid\" on the site, Giuliani, who stated that the Thunderbolt was about to collapse, had the coaster demolished; however, full destruction of the supposedly structurally unstable coaster took weeks. No connection between the Mets organization and the demolition has ever been proven, but Giuliani was later accused of tearing it down at the Mets' request.\n\nThor Equities ownership\n\nInitial interest\n\nIn 2003, Mayor Michael Bloomberg took an interest in revitalizing Coney Island as a possible site for the New York City bid of the 2012 Summer Olympics. A plan was developed by the Astella Development Corporation. When the city lost the bid for the Olympics, revitalization plans were passed on to the Coney Island Development Corporation (CIDC), which came up with a plan to restore the resort. Many amusement owners worried that because one of the report's goals to develop the area as a year-round destination, they could be forced out as their businesses are only seasonal and did not meet the CIDC's year-round goal. The CIDC also suggested that property north of Surf Avenue and west of Abe Stark should be rezoned for other uses including residential to lure developers into the area. Shortly before the CIDC's plans were publicly released, a development company, Thor Equities, purchased all of Bullard's 168000 ft2 western property, worth $2.2 million, for $13 million. In less than a year, Thor flipped the property to Taconic Investment Partners for over $90 million. Taconic now had 100 acre, on which it planned to build 2,000 apartment units. \n\nThor then went about using much of its $77 million profit to purchase property well over market value lining Stillwell Avenue and offered to buy out every piece of property inside the traditional amusement area. Quickly, rumors started that Thor was interested in building a retail mall in the heart of the amusement area. In September 2005, Thor's founder, Joe Sitt, went public with his new plans, which he claimed was going to be a large Bellagio-style hotel resort surrounded by rides and amusements. Alternatively, there would also be \"high-rise luxury condominiums\" or a Las Vegas Strip-style casino resort area. He also claimed that the interior of the resort would have an indoor mall that would allow local amusement owners to relocate their rides and operate them indoors year round and made promises that he had no intention of driving out any local amusement owners and wanted them all to be part of his new resort. Sitt released renderings of a hotel that would take up the entire amusement area from the Aquarium to beyond Keyspan Park and would most likely need to involve the demolition of The Wonder Wheel, Cyclone, and Nathan's original hot dog stand, as well as the new Keyspan Park.\n\nAt the same time, Brooklyn was involved with two other major development projects: the Pacific Park project, which involved eminent domain, and the Brooklyn Bridge Park project, which involved the demolition of a building with landmark status. Many feared that the city had already backed Thor's plans and that the entire amusement district would be demolished to make way for the new multimillion-dollar resort; in addition, Thor Equities had acquired infamy for convincing the city to rezone property, then flipping it for large prices.\n\nSale\n\nAstroland owner Carol Hill Albert, whose husband's family had owned the park since 1962, sold the site to developer Thor Equities in November 2006 for an undisclosed amount. In June 2006 Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn (EEK), an architectural design firm working for Thor, released detailed renderings of Thor's planned resort area showing luxury high rise condo towers in place of the hotel with retail on the ground floor. Since the area has both zoning restrictions only allowing amusements and no buildings taller than 260 ft. Thor initially denied any inclusion of condo towers in its plans and Eek quickly removed the renderings from its site, but not before blogs everywhere published copies of the renderings. Thor quickly released renderings of rides, including a steel coaster that would run above the boardwalk, a two tiered carousel, and a fountain at the foot of Stillwell Av. that would project images of whales and mermaids. Thor admitted that condos would be part of its resort and said that the resort was not economically feasible without the addition of condos. At a public meeting Thor representatives continued to downplay the condos by claiming that the company only wanted to build hundreds of condo units, not thousands. While Thor initially said it only wanted to build 575 condos the number crept up to 975. Late in 2006 Thor announced that it had just purchased Coney Island's last remaining amusement park, Astroland, and would be closing it after the 2007 season. Immediately Thor announced plans to build a Nickelodeon-themed hotel on the site.\n\nIn January 2007, Thor released renderings for a new amusement park to be built on the Astroland site called Coney Island Park.  Critics pointed out that even though Thor claimed its project would expand the amusement area, the company had already evicted several acres of amusements from the property it bought and planned to evict the rest of the amusements on the property after the 2007 season, as well as close Astroland.\n\nMeanwhile, the city brought up its own concerns about Thor's plans based on history with the developer. In 2001 Thor purchased the Albee Square Mall for $25 million claiming it wanted to revitalize it. Thor said it wanted to give the mall a Vegas-style makeover and bring in more name brand retail while maintaining the original vendors occupying the mall. The city complied and rezoned the property to permit the building of an office tower above the mall. Soon after, Thor sold the property to Arcadia Reality Trust for $125 million. Arcadia plans to demolish the mall and build the tower only with a possible box store on the ground level. City officials questioned Thor's motives for wanting the zoning changes inside the amusement zone and feared that once Thor gets those changes, it will flip the property to the highest bidder who will have no obligation to build any amusements. In the winter of 2007, Thor began to evict businesses from the buildings it owned along the boardwalk. But when one of the business owners went to the press with a statement that Thor was requiring its tenants to sign a confidentiality clause that lasted three years and prevented them from publicly commenting on Thor redeveloping the area, Thor quickly reinstated their leases.\n\nThor proposed a $1.5 billion renovation and expansion of the Coney Island amusement area to include hotels, shopping, movies, an indoor water park and the city's first new roller coaster since the Cyclone. The Municipal Art Society launched the initiative ImagineConey,  in early 2007, as discussion of a rezoning plan that highly favored housing and hotels began circulating from the Department of City Planning.  MAS held several public workshops, a call for ideas, and a charrette to garner attention to the issue.\n\nAstroland, which had served as a major amusement park since 1962, closed in 2008  and was replaced by a new incarnation of Dreamland in 2009 and of Luna Park in 2010.\n\nCity Planning certified the rezoning plan in January 2009 to negative responses from all amusement advocates and Coney Island enthusiasts. In 2012 the plan was working through the ULURP process.  Thor Equities said it hoped to complete the project by 2011.   Thor Equities plan to demolish most of the iconic, early 20th-century buildings along Surf Avenue.  In their place, Sitt plans to build cheap, one-story retail, and his recently released rendering clearly shows Burger King and Taco Bell-like buildings.  The Aquarium is also planning a renovation.  In June 2009, the city's planning commission unanimously approved the construction of 4,500 units of housing and 900 affordable units and vowed to \"preserve, in perpetuity, the open amusement area rides that everyone knows and loves,\" while protesters argued that \"20 percent affordable-housing component is unreasonably low.\" \n\n2010s\n\nBesides Luna Park, the remaining parks and attractions include Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, 12th Street Amusements, and Kiddie Park, while the Eldorado Arcade has an indoor bumper car ride. The Zipper and Spider on 12th Street were closed permanently on September 4, 2007, and dismantling began after its owner lost his lease. They are to be reassembled at an amusement park in Honduras. \n\nOn April 20, 2011, the first new roller coasters to be built at Coney Island in eighty years were opened as part of efforts to reverse the decline of the amusement area. \n\nIn 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused major damage to the Coney Island amusement parks, the Aquarium, and businesses. Nathan's, however, reported that the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest would be held the following summer, as usual.  Luna Park at Coney Island reopened on March 24, 2013.  Rebuilding of the Aquarium started in early 2013 and is expected to finish in 2017.\n\nTheme parks and attractions\n\nCurrently, Coney Island has two amusement parks — Luna Park and Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park — as well as several rides that are not incorporated into either theme park. Coney Island also has several other visitor attractions and hosts renowned events as well. Coney Island's amusement area is one of a few in the United States that is not mostly owned by any one entity.\n\nRides\n\nThe current amusement park contains various rides, games such as skeeball and ball tossing, and a sideshow, including games of shooting, throwing, and tossing skills. The rides and other amusements at Coney Island are owned and managed by several different companies and operate independently of each other. It is not possible to purchase season tickets to the attractions in the area.\n\nThree rides at Coney Island are protected as designated New York City landmarks and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. These three rides are:\n* Wonder Wheel – built in 1918 and opened in 1920, this steel Ferris wheel has both stationary cars and rocking cars that slide along a track. It holds 144 riders, stands 150 ft tall, and weighs over 200 tons. At night, the Wonder Wheel's steel frame is outlined and illuminated by neon tubes.  It is located at Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park.\n* The Cyclone roller coaster – built in 1927, it is one of the United States's oldest wooden coasters still in operation. Popular with roller coaster aficionados, the Cyclone includes an 85 ft, 60-degree drop. It is owned by the City of New York, and was operated by Astroland, under a franchise agreement. It is now located in and operated by Luna Park.\n* Parachute Jump – originally built as the Life Savers Parachute Jump at the 1939 New York World's Fair, this was the first ride of its kind. Patrons were hoisted 190 ft in the air before being allowed to drop using guy-wired parachutes. Although the ride has been closed since 1968, it remains a Coney Island landmark and is sometimes referred to as Brooklyn's Eiffel Tower. Between 2002 and 2004, it was completely dismantled, cleaned, painted, and restored, but remains inactive. After an official lighting ceremony in July 2006, the Parachute Jump was slated to be lit year-round using different color motifs to represent the seasons. However, this idea was scrapped when New York City started conserving electricity in the summer months, and it has not been lit regularly since.\n\nOther notable, currently operating attractions include:\n\n* Thunderbolt – In March 2014, construction started on the new Thunderbolt coaster at Coney Island.  The Thunderbolt will be manufactured by Zamperla at a cost of US$10 million and will have a 90-degree vertical drop, followed by a 100-foot loop and a zero-gravity roll, along with dives, hills and a corkscrew — all within two minutes.  The ride will feature  of track, a height of , and a top speed of .[http://www.lunaparknyc.com/about-us/media/118-nycedc-announces-new-qthunderboltq-roller-coaster-to-be-built-at-coney-island.html NYCEDC Announces New \"Thunderbolt\" Roller Coaster to be Built at Coney Island] Thunderbolt will feature three inversions including a vertical loop, corkscrew, and an Immelmann loop.     The Thunderbolt, will be located near Surf Avenue and West 15th Street in Coney Island will be constructed with 2,233 feet of track that will stretch to a height of 115 feet and will be built next to the B&B Carousell, an antique merry-go-round that underwent an extensive restoration and reopened last summer. The opening of the Thunderbolt, expected to be by Memorial Day 2014,   was pushed back to June 6, 2014,   and in early June, it was delayed once again to later in summer 2014.   Finally, on June 14, the Thunderbolt was opened. \n* B&B Carousell  (as spelled by the frame's builder, William F. Mangels) – this is Coney Island's last traditional carousel, near the old entrance to Luna Park but now surrounded by furniture stores. The carousel is faster than usual, with a traditional roll-operated fairground organ. When the long-term operator died unexpectedly, the carousel was put up for auction, with fears that it would leave Coney Island or be broken up for sale to collectors. However, the City of New York bought the B&B Carousell a few days before the auction; it has since been dismantled, with plans to operate it again in Coney Island in 2013 in a newly constructed carousel pavilion that will be built in Steeplechase Plaza, a 2.2-acre public plaza that is also scheduled to be open for the 2013 season. All the other carousels on Coney Island are kiddie park-style.    For the restoration, Theresa Rollison, a painter with Carousels and Carvings, custom-mixed more than 80 colors to replicate the original hues. She then applied salmon pink, lemon yellow, metallic silver and maroon, using natural brushes made from badger, squirrel, and hog bristle. “I wouldn’t have chosen to put some of the colors together, but overall it works,” she said.  The final part of the restoration was new horsehair tails for the 50 horses, and with that the New York City Economic Development Corp paid $1,700,000 for the restoration.  For decades, Coney Island was something of a carousel headquarters. In the late 1800s, carousel makers set up shops there, and by the turn of the century, two dozen merry-go-rounds were operating on the island. There even evolved a Coney Island school of carousel design, distinct from the more staid Philadelphia and County Fair styles. The Coney Island style was characterized by a flamboyant, aggressive-looking horse — neck straining, nostrils flaring, and tongue lolling.  The B&B was built in Coney Island, with a frame dating to 1906, and at some point, it operated in New Jersey, although it is unclear for how long. In the early 1920s it received a new set of horses that were carved by Charles Carmel, one of Coney Island’s celebrated carousel makers. It had returned to Brooklyn by 1935.    \n* Bumper cars – there are three separate bumper car rides on Coney Island, located on 12th street, Deno's Wonder Wheel Park, and Eldorado's Arcade on Surf Avenue.\n* Haunted houses – two traditional dark ride haunted houses operate at Coney Island, Spook-a-Rama at Deno's and Ghost Hole on 12th street.\n\n Former rides include:\n* Thunderbolt – this roller coaster across the street from Steeplechase Park was constructed in 1925 and closed in 1983. It was torn down by the city \"to protect public safety\" in 2000 during the construction of nearby Keyspan Park. In the Woody Allen movie Annie Hall, Allen's character's family lives in the small house-like structure under the rear of the roller coaster track.\n* Tornado – this roller coaster was constructed in 1926. It suffered a series of small fires which made the structure unstable, and was torn down in 1977.\n* Steeplechase Park Horse Race – created by a Coney Island resident George C. Tilyou in 1897, this ride consisted of people riding wooden horses around the park on a steel track. \n\nBeach\n\nConey Island maintains a broad sandy beach from West 37th Street at Sea Gate, through the central Coney Island area and Brighton Beach, to the beginning of the community of Manhattan Beach, a distance of approximately . The beach is continuous and is served for its entire length by the broad Riegelmann Boardwalk. A number of amusements are directly accessible from the land-side of the boardwalk, as is the aquarium and a variety of food shops and arcades.\n\nThe beach is groomed and replenished on a regular basis by the city. The position of the beach and lack of significant obstructions means virtually the entire beach is in sunlight all day. The beach is open to all without restriction, and there is no charge for use. The beach area is divided into \"bays\", areas of beach delineated by rock jetties, which moderate erosion and the force of ocean waves.\n\nThe Coney Island Polar Bear Club consists of a group of people who swim at Coney Island throughout the winter months, most notably on New Year's Day, when additional participants join them to swim in the frigid waters.\n\nThe beach serves as the training grounds for the Coney Island Brighton Beach Open Water Swimmers (CIBBOWS), a group dedicated to promoting open water swimming for individuals of all levels. CIBBOWS hosts several open water swim races each year, such as Grimaldo's Mile and the New York Aquarium 5k, as well as regular weekend training swims.\n\nOther attractions\n\nNearby, the New York Aquarium, which opened in 1957 on the former site of the Dreamland amusement park, is another attraction on Coney Island. In 2001, KeySpan Park opened on the former site of Steeplechase Park to host the Brooklyn Cyclones minor league baseball team.\n\nEvents\n\nThe Coney Island Mermaid Parade takes place on Surf Avenue and the boardwalk, and features floats and various acts. It has been produced annually by Coney Island USA, a non-profit arts organization established in 1979, dedicated to preserving the dignity of American popular culture.\n\nConey Island USA has also sponsored the Coney Island Film Festival every October since 2000, as well as Burlesque At The Beach, and Creepshow at the Freakshow (an interactive Halloween-themed event). It also houses the Coney Island Museum.\n\nThe annual Cosme 5K Charity Run/Walk, supported by the Coney Island Sports Foundation (CISF), takes place on the last Sunday of June on the Riegelmann Boardwalk.\n\nIn August 2006, Coney Island hosted a major national volleyball tournament sponsored by the Association of Volleyball Professionals. The tournament, usually held on the west coast of the United States, was televised live on NBC. The league built a 4,000-seat stadium and twelve outer courts next to the boardwalk for the event.  The tournament returned to Coney Island in 2007 and 2008.\n\nIn April 2009, Feld Entertainment, parent company to Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, announced that \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" would perform on Coney Island for the entire summer of 2009, the first time since July 16, 1956 that Ringling Bros. had performed in this location. The tents were located between the boardwalk and Surf Avenue, and the show was called The Coney Island Boom-A-Ring. In 2010, they returned to the same location with The Coney Island Illuscination. \n\nDemographics\n\nAt the 2000 census, there were 51,205 people living in Coney Island. Of those people, 51.2% were White, 29.3% were Black, 18% were Hispanic or Latino, 3.8% were Asian, 0.5% were Native American, 0.1% were Pacific Islander, 7.6% were some other race, and 3.7% described themselves as two or more races. 70.5% had a high school diploma or higher, and 20.7% had a bachelor's degree or higher. The median household income in 1999 was $21,281.\n\nThe neighborhoods on Coney Island, from west to east, are Sea Gate, Coney Island proper, Brighton Beach, and Manhattan Beach. Sea Gate is a private community, one of only a handful of neighborhoods in New York City where the streets are co-owned by the residents and the city. Sea Gate residents pay both, city and Sea Gate taxes. Sea Gate and the Breezy Point Cooperative are the only city neighborhoods cordoned off by a fence and gate houses.\n\nThe majority of Coney Island's population resides in approximately thirty 18- to 24-story towers, mostly various forms of public housing. In between the towers are many blocks that were filled with vacant and burned out buildings. Since the 1990s there has been steady revitalization of the area. Many townhouses were built on empty lots, popular franchises opened, and Keyspan Park was built to serve as the home for the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team. Once home to many Jewish residents, Coney Island's main population groups today are African American, Hispanic, and recent Russian immigrants.\n\nEducation\n\nPrimary and secondary schools\n\nConey Island is served by the New York City Department of Education.

                "Long Island is an island located just off the northeast coast of the United States and a region within the U.S. state of New York. Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (these form the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Queens and Brooklyn) colloquially use the term \"Long Island\" (or \"The Island\") exclusively to refer to the Nassau-Suffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character.  North of the island is Long Island Sound, across from which lie the states of Connecticut and a small part of Rhode Island.\n\nWith a Census-estimated population of 7,838,722 in 2015, constituting nearly 40% of the state's population,     Long Island is the most populated island in any U.S. state or territory, and the 18th-most populous island in the world (ahead of Ireland, Jamaica, and Hokkaidō). Its population density is 5571 PD/sqmi. If Long Island geographically constituted an independent metropolitan statistical area, it would rank fourth most populous in the United States; while if it were a U.S. state, Long Island would rank 13th in population and first in population density.\n\nBoth the longest\n\nand the largest island in the contiguous United States, Long Island extends 118 mi eastward from New York Harbor to Montauk Point, with a maximum north-to-south distance of 23 mi between Long Island Sound and the Atlantic coast.\n\nWith a land area of 1,401 square miles (3,630 km2), Long Island is the 11th-largest island in the United States and the 149th-largest island in the world — larger than the  of the smallest state, Rhode Island. \n\nTwo of the New York City metropolitan area's three busiest airports, JFK International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, as well as two major air traffic control radar facilities, the New York TRACON and the New York ARTCC, are located on the Island. Nine bridges and 13 tunnels (including railroad tunnels) connect Brooklyn and Queens (and thus Long Island) to the three other boroughs of New York City. Ferries connect Suffolk County northward across Long Island Sound to the state of Connecticut. In addition, the Long Island Rail Road is the busiest commuter railroad in North America and operates 24/7.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\n At the time of European contact, the Lenape people (named the Delaware by Europeans) inhabited the western end of Long Island, and spoke the Munsee dialect of Lenape, one of the Algonquian language family. Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to record an encounter with these people, after entering what is now New York Bay in 1524. The eastern portion of the island was inhabited by speakers of the Mohegan-Montauk-Narragansett language group of Algonquian languages; they were part of the Pequot and Narrangansett peoples inhabiting what is now Connecticut and Rhode Island.\n\nIn 1609, the English navigator Henry Hudson explored the harbor and purportedly landed at Coney Island. Adriaen Block followed in 1615 and is credited as the first European to determine that both Manhattan and Long Island are islands.\n\nIndian land deeds recorded by the Dutch from 1636 state that the Indians referred to Long Island as Sewanhaka (Sewanhacky and Sewanhacking were other spellings in the transliteration of Lenape). Sewan was one of the terms for wampum (commemorative stringed shell beads, for a while also used as currency by colonists in trades with the Lenape), and is also translated as \"loose\" or \"scattered\", which may refer either to the wampum or to Long Island. \nThe name \" 't Lange Eylandt alias Matouwacs\" (later shortened to \"Lange Eylandt\") appears in Dutch maps from the 1650s.  \nLater, the English referred to the land as \"Nassau Island\", \nafter the Dutch Prince William of Nassau, Prince of Orange (who later also ruled as King William III of England). It is unclear when the name \"Nassau Island\" was discontinued.\n\nThe very first settlements on Long Island were by settlers from England and its colonies in present-day New England. Lion Gardiner settled nearby Gardiners Island in 1637. The first settlement on the geographic Long Island itself was on October 21, 1640, when Southold was established by settlers from New Haven, Connecticut. Southampton was settled in the same year. Hempstead followed in 1644, East Hampton in 1648, Huntington in 1653, and Brookhaven in 1655.\n\nWhile the eastern region of Long Island was first settled by English, the western portion of Long Island was settled by the Dutch. Until 1664, the jurisdiction of Long Island was split, roughly at the present border between Nassau County and Suffolk County. The Dutch founded six towns in present-day Brooklyn beginning in 1645. These included: Brooklyn, Gravesend, Flatlands, Flatbush, New Utrecht, and Bushwick. The Dutch had granted an English settlement in Hempstead, New York (now in Nassau County) in 1644 but, after a boundary dispute, drove out English settlers from the Oyster Bay area. In 1664, the English took over the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, including all their lands on Long Island, and controlled the 120 mi expanse (except for all the territories inhabited by indigenous peoples.)\n\nThe 1664 land patent granted to the Duke of York included all islands in Long Island Sound. The Duke of York held a grudge against Connecticut, as New Haven had hidden three of the judges who sentenced the Duke's father, King Charles I, to death in 1649. Settlers throughout Suffolk County pressed to stay part of Connecticut, but Governor Sir Edmund Andros threatened to eliminate the settlers' rights to land if they did not yield, which they did by 1676. \n\nAll of Long Island (as well as the islands between it and Connecticut) became part of the Province of New York within the Shire of York.\nPresent-day Suffolk County was designated as the East Riding (of Yorkshire), present-day Brooklyn was part of the West Riding, and present-day Queens and Nassau were part of the larger North Riding. In 1683, Yorkshire was dissolved and the three original counties on Long Island were established: Kings, Queens, and Suffolk.\n\n18th and 19th centuries\n\nEarly in the American Revolutionary War, the island was captured  by the British from General George Washington in the Battle of Long Island, a decisive battle after which Washington narrowly evacuated his troops from Brooklyn Heights under a dense fog. After the British victory on Long Island, many Patriots fled, leaving mostly Loyalists behind. The island remained a British stronghold until the end of the war in 1783.\n\nGeneral Washington based his espionage activities on Long Island, due to the western part of the island's proximity to the British military headquarters in New York City. The Culper Spy Ring included agents operating between Setauket and Manhattan. This ring alerted Washington to valuable British secrets, including the treason of Benedict Arnold and a plan to use counterfeiting to induce economic sabotage.\n\nLong Island's colonists served both Loyalist and Patriot causes, with many prominent families divided among both sides. During the occupation British troops used a number of civilian structures for defense and demanded to be quartered in the homes of civilians. A number of structures from this era remain. Among these are Raynham Hall, the Oyster Bay home of patriot spy Robert Townsend, and the Caroline Church in Setauket, which contains bullet holes from a skirmish known as the Battle of Setauket. Also in existence is a reconstruction of Brooklyn's Old Stone House, on the site of the Maryland 400's celebrated last stand during the Battle of Long Island.\n\nIn the 19th century, Long Island was still mainly rural and devoted to agriculture. The predecessor to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) began service in 1836 from the South Ferry, Brooklyn, through Brooklyn to Jamaica in Queens. The line was completed to the east end of Long Island in 1844 (as part of a plan for transportation to Boston). Competing railroads (soon absorbed by the LIRR) were built along the south shore to accommodate travellers from those more populated areas. For the century from 1830 until 1930, total population roughly doubled every twenty years, with more dense development in areas near Manhattan. Several cities were incorporated, such as the City of Brooklyn in Kings County, and Long Island City in Queens.\n\nUntil the 1883 completion of the Brooklyn Bridge, the only connection between Long Island and the rest of the United States was by boat and ship. As other bridges and tunnels were constructed, areas of the island began to be developed as residential suburbs, first around the railroads that offered commuting into the city. On January 1, 1898, Kings County and portions of Queens were consolidated into The City of Greater New York, abolishing all cities and towns within them. The easternmost 280 sqmi of Queens County, which were not part of the consolidation plan,\n\n (before vote)\n \n (before election)\n\n (before results of Queens vote known)\n\n \n\nseparated from Queens in 1899 to form Nassau County.\n\nAt the close of the 19th century, wealthy industrialists who made vast fortunes during the Gilded Age began to construct large \"baronial\" country estates in Nassau County communities along the North Shore of Long Island, favoring the many lots with water views. Proximity to Manhattan attracted such men as J. P. Morgan, William K. Vanderbilt, and Charles Pratt, whose estates led to this area being nicknamed the Gold Coast. This period and the area was immortalized in fiction, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (which has also been adapted in films.)\n\n20th and 21st centuries\n\nCharles Lindbergh lifted off from Roosevelt Field with his Spirit of Saint Louis for his historic 1927 solo flight to Europe, one of the events that helped to establish Long Island as an early center of aviation during the 20th Century. Other famous aviators such as Wiley Post originated notable flights from Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, which became the first major airport serving New York City before it was superseded by the opening of La Guardia Airport in 1939. Long Island was also the site of Mitchel Air Force Base and was a major center of military aircraft production by companies such as Grumman and Fairchild Aircraft during World War II and for some decades afterward. Aircraft production on Long Island extended all the way into the Space Age – Grumman was one of the major contractors that helped to build the early lunar flight and space shuttle vehicles. Although the aircraft companies eventually ended their Long Island operations and the early airports were all later closed – Roosevelt Field, for instance, became the site of a major indoor shopping center – the Cradle of Aviation Museum on the site of the former Mitchel Field documents the Island's key role in the history of aviation.\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1940s, Long Island began the transformation from backwoods and farms as developers created numerous suburbs. Numerous branches of the LIRR already enabled commuting from the suburbs to the city. Robert Moses engineered various automobile parkway projects to span the island, and developed beaches and state parks for the enjoyment of residents and visitors from the city. Gradually, development also followed these parkways, with various communities springing up along the more traveled routes.\n\nAfter World War II, suburban development increased with incentives under the GI Bill, and Long Island's population skyrocketed, mostly in Nassau County and western Suffolk County. Second and third-generation children of immigrants moved out to Long Island to settle in new housing developments built during the post-war boom. Levittown became noted as a suburb, where house construction was simplified to be produced on a large scale. These provided opportunities for GIs returning home to buy houses and start a family.\n\nThe descendants of late 19th and early 20th-century immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, and black migrants from the South, have been followed by more recent ones from Latin America. These have created a diversity on Long Island lacked in other American regions. The population has many ethnic Irish, Jews and Italians, as well as an increasing number of Asians and Hispanics reflecting later migrations.\n\nIn 1985, the United States Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Maine that Long Island was not an island for legal purposes.    \n\nBy the start of the 21st century a number of Long Island communities had successfully converted their assets from industrial uses to post-industrial roles. Brooklyn reversed decades of population decline and factory closings to resurface as a globally renowned cultural and intellectual hotbed. Gentrification has affected much of Brooklyn and a portion of Queens, relocating a sizeable swath of New York City's population. On eastern Long Island, such villages as Port Jefferson, Patchogue, and Riverhead have been changed from inactive shipbuilding and mill towns into tourist-centric commercial centers with cultural attractions.\n\nHurricane Sandy, on October 29, 2012, caused extensive damage to low-lying coastal areas of Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk counties, destroying or severely damaging thousands of area homes and other structures by ocean and bay storm surges. Hundreds of thousands of residents were left without electric power for periods of time ranging up to several weeks while the damage was being repaired.\n\nA flood occurred on August 13, 2014 in Long Island after record-setting rainfall deposited two months' worth of precipitation on the area.\n\nGeography\n\nThe westernmost end of Long Island contains the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn (Kings County) and Queens (Queens County). The central and eastern portions contain the suburban Nassau and Suffolk counties. However, colloquial usage of the term \"Long Island\" usually refers only to Nassau and Suffolk counties. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a district named \"Long Island (Nassau-Suffolk Metro Division).\"  At least as late as 1911, locations in Queens were still commonly referred to as being on Long Island.  Some institutions in the New York City section of the island use the island's names, like Long Island University and Long Island Jewish Medical Center.\n\nNassau County is more densely developed than Suffolk County. While affluent overall, Nassau County has pockets of more pronounced wealth with estates covering greater acreage within the Gold Coast of the North Shore and the Five Towns area on the South Shore. South Shore communities are built along protected wetlands of the island and contain white sandy beaches of Outer Barrier Islands fronting on the Atlantic Ocean. Dutch and English settlers from the time before the American Revolutionary War, as well as communities of Native Americans, populated the island. The 19th century saw the infusion of the wealthiest Americans in the so-called Gold Coast of the North Shore, where wealthy Americans and Europeans in the Gilded Age built lavish country homes.\n\nIn its easternmost sections, Suffolk remains small-town rural, as in Greenport on the North Fork and some of the outward areas of The Hamptons, although summer tourism swells the population in those areas.\n\nThe North Fork peninsula of Suffolk County's East End has developed a burgeoning Wine Country region.  The South Fork peninsula is known for beach communities, including the prominently known Hamptons, and for the Montauk Point Lighthouse at the eastern tip of the island. The Pine Barrens is a preserved pine forest encompassing much of eastern Suffolk County.\n\nGeology\n\nA detailed geomorphological study of  Long Island provides evidence of glacial history of the kame and terminal moraines of the island which were formed by the advance and retreat of two ice sheets. \n\nLong Island, as part of the Outer Lands region, is formed largely of two spines of glacial moraine, with a large, sandy outwash plain beyond. These moraines consist of gravel and loose rock left behind during the two most recent pulses of Wisconsin glaciation during the Ice Ages some 21,000 years ago (19,000 BC). The northern moraine, which directly abuts the North Shore of Long Island at points, is known as the Harbor Hill moraine. The more southerly moraine, known as the Ronkonkoma moraine, forms the \"backbone\" of Long Island; it runs primarily through the very center of Long Island, roughly coinciding with the length of the Long Island Expressway.\n\nThe land to the south of this moraine to the South Shore is the outwash plain of the last glacier. One part of the outwash plain was known as the Hempstead Plains, and this land contained one of the few natural prairies to exist east of the Appalachian Mountains. \n\nThe glaciers melted and receded to the north, resulting in the difference between the North Shore beaches and the South Shore beaches. The North Shore beaches are rocky from the remaining glacial debris, while the South Shore's are crisp, clear, outwash sand. Jayne's Hill, at 401 ft, within Suffolk County near its border with Nassau County, is the highest hill along either moraine; another well-known summit is Bald Hill in Brookhaven Town, not far from its geographical center at Middle Island. The glaciers also formed Lake Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County and Lake Success in Nassau County, each a deep  kettle lake.\n\nClimate\n\nLong Island has a climate similar to that of other coastal areas of the Northeastern United States; it has warm, humid summers and chilly, damp winters with variable precipitation. Under the Köppen climate classification, most of Long Island lies in a transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and a humid continental climate (Dfa).  The oceanic climate zone (Cfb) only exists on the North Fork, the eastern end of the South Fork, islands in Peconic Bay, and Fishers Island, and is rare in eastern North America. Parts of the Harbor Hill Moraine are affected by a subtropical highland climate. The Atlantic Ocean brings afternoon sea breezes that temper the heat in the warmer months and limit the frequency and severity of thunderstorms. Long Island has a moderately sunny climate, averaging between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually. \n\nDue to its coastal location, Long Island temperatures are somewhat mild compared to the rest of the state. The coldest month is January, when average temperatures range from , and the warmest month is July, when average temperatures range from . Temperatures seldom fall below 5 F or rise above 95 F. Long Island temperatures vary from west to east, with the western part (Nassau County, Queens, and Brooklyn) generally warmer than the east (Suffolk County). This is due to several factors: the western part is closer to the mainland and more densely developed, causing the \"urban heat island\" effect, and Long Island's land mass veers northward as one travels east. Also, daytime high temperatures on the eastern part of Long Island are cooler on most occasions due to moderation of the Atlantic Ocean and Long Island Sound. On dry nights with no clouds or wind, the Pine Barrens forest of eastern Suffolk County can be almost 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) cooler than the rest of the island due to radiational cooling. Average dew points, a measure of atmospheric moisture, typically lie in the  range during July and August.\n\nPrecipitation is distributed fairly uniformly throughout the year, with approximately  on average during each month. Average yearly snowfall totals range from approximately 20 to, with the north shore and western parts averaging more than the south shore and the east end. In any given winter, however, some parts of the island could see up to 75 in of snow or more. There are also some very quiet winters, in which most parts of the island could see less than 10 in of snow.\n\nLong Island is somewhat vulnerable to hurricanes.\n\nIts northern location (and the relatively cool waters around it) tend to weaken tropical cyclones before they reach Long Island; nonetheless, several have stricken the Island as full hurricanes, including a devastating Category 3, the 1938 New England Hurricane (also known as the Long Island Express), and another Category 3, Hurricane Carol in 1954. Other 20th-century storms that made landfall on Long Island at hurricane intensity include the Great Atlantic Hurricane of 1944, Hurricane Donna in 1960, Hurricane Belle in 1976, and Hurricane Gloria in 1985. Also, the eyewall of Hurricane Bob in 1991 brushed the eastern tip. In August 2011, portions of Long Island were evacuated in preparation for Hurricane Irene, a Category 1 hurricane which weakened to a tropical storm before it reached Long Island. \nOn October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy, a slow-moving \"superstorm\", reached the area causing 90% of Long Island households to lose power and an estimated $18 billion in damages in Nassau & Suffolk Counties alone.   The storm also had a devastating impact on coastal communities in the Brooklyn and Queens portions of the island, including Coney Island in Brooklyn and the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, although estimates of monetary damages there are usually calculated as part of the overall losses suffered in New York City as a whole. \nThe extent of Sandy's damages is second only to those caused by the 1938 Long Island Express, when adjusted for inflation. Although a lower central pressure was recorded in Sandy, the National Hurricane Center estimates that the 1938 hurricane had a lower pressure at landfall.   Hurricane Sandy and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of Long Island and New York City to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.  \n\nAdditional islands\n\nSeveral smaller islands are in close proximity to Long Island and are often grouped with it.  These islands include Fire Island, Plum Island, Robins Island, Gardiners Island, Fishers Island, Long Beach Barrier Island, Jones Beach Island, and Shelter Island.\n\nDemographics\n\nLong Island is one of the most densely populated regions in the United States. As of the United States 2010 Census, the total population of all four counties of Long Island was 7,568,304, which was 39 percent of the population of the State of New York. New York City's portion of the census was 4,735,538, with Brooklyn's population at 2,504,700 and Queens having 2,230,722 residents. Long Island's proportion of New York's population has been increasing, with Long Island's Census-estimated population increasing 3.1% since 2010, to 7,838,722 in 2015, representing 39.6% of New York's Census-estimated 2015 population of 19,795,791.  According to the US Census Bureau's 2008 American Community Survey, Nassau and Suffolk counties have the 10th and 26th highest median household incomes in the nation, respectively. \n\nAs of the 2010 census, the combined population of Nassau and Suffolk counties was 2,832,882 people; Suffolk County's share being 1,493,350 and Nassau County's 1,339,532. Nassau County had a larger population for decades, but Suffolk County surpassed it in the 1990 census as growth and development continued to spread eastward.\n\nAs Suffolk County has more than twice the land area of Nassau County, the latter still has a much higher population density. Combining all four counties, Long Island's population is greater than 38 of the 50 U.S. states.\n\nPopulation figures from the U.S. Census Bureau Census 2010\nshow that whites are the largest racial group in all four counties, and are in the majority in Nassau and Suffolk counties. In 2002, The New York Times cited a study by the non-profit group ERASE Racism, which determined that Nassau and Suffolk counties constitute the most racially segregated suburbs in the United States. \n\nIn contrast, Queens is the most ethnically diverse county in the United States and the most diverse urban area in the world.  \n\nAccording to a 2000 report on religion, which asked congregations to respond, Catholics are the largest religious group on Long Island, with non-affiliated in second place. Catholics make up 52% of the population of Nassau and Suffolk, versus 22% for the country as a whole, with Jews at 16% and 7%, respectively, versus 1.7% nationwide. Only a  small percentage of Protestants responded, 7% and 8% respectively, for Nassau and Suffolk counties. This is in contrast with 23% for the entire country on the same survey, and 50% on self-identification surveys.\n\nMore recently, a Little India (लघु भारत) community has emerged in Hicksville, Nassau County,  spreading eastward from the more established Little India enclaves in Queens. Rapidly growing Chinatowns have developed in Brooklyn (布魯克林) and Queens (皇后), with Asian immigrants moving into Nassau County,   as did earlier European immigrants, such as the Irish and Italians.\n\nLikewise, the Long Island Koreatown (롱 아일랜드 코리아타운) originated in Flushing, Queens. It is expanding eastward along Northern Boulevard\n\n and into Nassau County.\n\nA 2010 article in The New York Times stated that the expansion of the immigrant workforce on Long Island has not displaced any jobs from other Long Island residents. Half of the immigrants on Long Island hold white-collar positions.\n\nThe counties of Nassau and Suffolk have been long renowned for their affluence. Long Island is home to some of the wealthiest communities in the United States, including The Hamptons, on the East End of the South Shore of Suffolk County; the Gold Coast, in the vicinity of the island's North Shore, along Long Island Sound; and increasingly, the western shoreline of Brooklyn, facing Manhattan. In 2016, according to Business Insider, the 11962 zip code encompassing Sagaponack, within Southampton, was listed as the most expensive in the U.S., with a median home sale price of $8.5 million. \n\nEconomy\n\nFrom about 1930 to about 1990, Long Island was considered one of the aviation centers of the United States, with companies such as Grumman Aircraft, Republic, Fairchild, and Curtiss having their headquarters and factories on Long Island.\n\nLong Island has played a prominent role in scientific research and in engineering. It is the home of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in nuclear physics and Department of Energy research.\n\nIn recent decades companies such as Sperry Rand, Computer Associates (headquartered in Islandia), Zebra Technologies (now occupying the former headquarters of Symbol Technologies and a former Grumman plant in Holtsville), have made Long Island a center for the computer industry.  Stony Brook University of the State University of New York and New York Institute of Technology conduct advanced medical and technology research.\n\nLong Island is also home to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which was directed for 35 years by James D. Watson (who, along with Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin, discovered the double helix structure of DNA).\n\nLong Island is home to the East Coast's largest industrial park, the Hauppauge Industrial Park. The park has over 1,300 companies employing more than 71,000 Long Islanders. Companies in the park and abroad are represented by the Hauppauge Industrial Association.\nAs many as 20 percent of Long Islanders commute to New York City jobs.\nThe eastern end of the island is still partly agricultural. In the last 25 years, development of vineyards on the North Fork became a major new industry, replacing potato fields. Pumpkin farms have been added to traditional truck farming. Farms allow fresh fruit picking by Long Islanders for much of the year. Fishing continues to be an important industry, especially at Huntington, Northport, Montauk, and other coastal communities of the East End and South Shore.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nNassau County and Suffolk County each have their own governments, with a County Executive leading each. Each has a county legislature and countywide-elected officials, such as district attorney, county clerk, and county comptroller.  The towns in both counties have their own governments as well, with town supervisors and a town council.  Nassau County is divided into three towns and two small incorporated cities (Glen Cove and Long Beach). Suffolk County is divided into ten towns.\n\nBrooklyn and Queens, on the other hand, do not have county governments. As boroughs of New York City, both have Borough Presidents, which have been largely ceremonial offices since the shutdown of the New York City Board of Estimate.\n\nLong Island is home to two Native American reservations, Poospatuck Reservation, and Shinnecock Reservation.  Both reservations are in Suffolk County.  Numerous island place names are Native American in origin.\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nQueens and Brooklyn are patrolled by the New York City Police Department; Nassau and Suffolk counties respectively have the Nassau County Police Department and Suffolk County Police Department. New York State Police patrol state parks and parkways. Several dozen villages and the two cities in Nassau have their own police departments.\n\nNassau and Suffolk each have a sheriff's office that handles civil process, evictions, warrant service and enforcement, prisoner transport and detention, and operation of the county jail.\n\nSecession proposals\n\nThe secession of Long Island from New York was proposed as early as 1896, but talk was revived towards the latter part of the twentieth century. \nOn March 28, 2008, Suffolk County, New York Comptroller Joseph Sawicki proposed a plan that would make Long Island (specifically, Nassau and Suffolk counties) the 51st state of the United States of America.\n\nSawicki says that all the Long Island taxpayers' money would stay on Long Island, rather than the funds being dispersed all over the entire state of New York, and Long Island sending to Albany over three billion dollars more than it receives back.   The state of Long Island would include over 2.7 million people (larger than that of fifteen other states).  So far Nassau County executives have not expressed interest in joining in the secession proposal, which would need to be approved by the NY State Legislature.\n\nTransportation\n\nEvery major form of transportation serves Long Island, including John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and Long Island MacArthur Airport, multiple smaller airports, railroads, the New York City Subway, and several major highways. There are historic and modern bridges, recreational and commuter trails, and ferries serving various parts of all of Long Island.\n\nThere are currently ten road crossings out of Long Island, all within New York City limits at the extreme western end of the island. Plans for a Long Island Crossing at various locations in Nassau and Suffolk Counties (a proposed bridge or tunnel that would link Long Island to the south with New York or Connecticut to the north across Long Island Sound) have been discussed for decades, but there are currently no firm plans to construct such a crossing.\n\nPublic transportation\n\nThe MTA implements mass transportation for the New York metropolitan area including all five boroughs of New York City, the suburban counties of Dutchess, Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester, all of which together are the \"Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD)\".\n\nThe MTA is the largest public transportation provider in the Western Hemisphere. Its agencies serve 14.6 million people spread over 5,000 square miles (13,000 km²) from New York City through the southeastern section of the state (including Long Island and the lower Hudson Valley), and Connecticut.  Combined the MTA agencies now move more than 2.6 billion rail and bus customers a year while employing some 70,000 workers.\n\nRail\n\nThe Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) is the busiest commuter railroad system in North America, carrying an average of 282,400 passengers each weekday on 728 daily trains. Chartered on April 24, 1834 and operating continuously since, it is also the oldest railroad in the U.S. still operating under its original charter and name. \n\nBus\n\nNassau Inter-County Express (NICE) provides bus service in Nassau County, while Suffolk County Transit, an agency of the Suffolk County government, provides bus service in Suffolk County. In 2012, NICE replaced the former Long Island Bus in transporting Long Islanders across Nassau County while still allowing them to use MTA MetroCards as payment. \n\nRoads\n\nThe Long Island Expressway, Northern State Parkway, and Southern State Parkway, all products of the automobile-centered planning of Robert Moses, are the island's primary east-west high-speed controlled-access highways.\n\nGround transportation\n\nBeing such a large, populous island with several airports connecting the island to the rest of the world, there are several hundred transportation companies that service the Long Island/New York City area. Winston airport shuttle, the oldest of these companies in business since 1973, was the first to introduce door-to-door shared-ride service to and from the major airports, which almost all transportation companies now utilize. \n\nEducation\n\nPrimary and secondary education\n\nLong Island's Nassau and Suffolk counties are the home of 125 public school districts containing a total of 656 public schools. In contrast, all of Brooklyn and Queens are served by the New York City Department of Education, the largest school district in the United States. Long Island is also home to a number of private and parochial schools.\n\nColleges and universities\n\nLong Island is home to a range of higher-education institutions, both public and private.\n\nBrooklyn and Queens contain five of eleven senior colleges within CUNY, the public university system of New York City and one of the largest in the country. Among these are the notable institutions of Brooklyn College and Queens College. Brooklyn also contains private colleges such as Pratt Institute and the New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering, an engineering college that merged with New York University in 2014.\n\nNassau and Suffolk counties are similarly served by community colleges, as well as several colleges and universities within the SUNY system, notably Stony Brook (for its health sciences research and medical center). Private institutions include the New York Institute of Technology, Hofstra University and Adelphi University (both located in the Town of Hempstead), as well as Long Island University (with its C.W. Post campus, located on a former Gold Coast estate in Brookville, and a satellite campus in downtown Brooklyn).  Long Island also contains the Webb Institute, a small naval architecture college in Glen Cove. In addition, the island is home to the United States Merchant Marine Academy, a Federal Service Academy located in Kings Point, on the North Shore.\n\nCulture\n\nMusic\n\nMusic on Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk) is strongly influenced by the proximity to New York City and by the youth culture of the suburbs.\nPsychedelic rock was widely popular in the 1960s as flocks of disaffected youth travelled to NYC to participate in protest and the culture of the time. R & B also has a history on Long Island, especially in areas close to New York City.  In the late 1970s through the 1980s, the influence of radio station WLIR made Long Island one of the first places in the U.S. to hear and embrace European New Wave bands such as Depeche Mode, the Pet Shop Boys, and Culture Club. In the 1990s, hip-hop became very popular with rap pioneers Rakim, EPMD, and Public Enemy growing up on Long Island. Recently, new bands have been making a name for themselves originating from Long Island such as Brand New, Austin Schoeffel and Envy on the Coast.\n\nFamous rock bands that originated on Long Island include The Rascals, The Ramones (from Queens), Dream Theater, Blue Öyster Cult, Twisted Sister and guitar virtuosos John Petrucci, Steve Vai and Joe Satriani. Rock and pop singer Billy Joel grew up on Long Island and his youthful life there is reflected in some of his music.\n\nThe Nassau Coliseum and Nikon at Jones Beach Theater are venues used by national touring acts as performance spaces for concerts.  Nikon at Jones Beach Theater is an outdoor amphitheatre, located at Jones Beach State Park. It is a popular place to view summer concerts, with new as well as classic artists performing there during the summer months. It hosts a large Fourth of July fireworks show every year which fills the stands. People also park cars along the highway leading to the show, and others watch from the nearby beaches. \n\nLong Island is also known for its school music programs. Many schools in Suffolk County have distinguished music programs, with high numbers of students who are accepted into the statewide All-State music groups, or even the National All-Eastern Coast music groups. Both the Suffolk County and Nassau County Music Educator's Associations are recognized by The National Association for Music Education (MENC),  \nand host numerous events, competitions, and other music-related activities.\n\nCuisine\n\nLong Island has historically been a center for fishing and seafood. This legacy continues in the Blue Point oyster, a now ubiquitous variety that was originally harvested on the Great South Bay and was the favorite oyster of Queen Victoria. Clams are also a popular food and clam digging a popular recreational pursuit, with Manhattan clam chowder reputed to have Long Island origins. \n\nOf land-based produce, Long Island duck has a history of national recognition since the 19th century, with four duck farms continuing to produce 2 million ducks a year .  Two symbols of Long Island's duck farming heritage are the Long Island Ducks minor-league baseball team and the Big Duck, a 1931 duck-shaped building that is a historic landmark and tourist attraction. In addition to Long Island's duck industry, Riverhead contains one of the largest buffalo farms on the East coast. \n\nLong Island is well known for its production of alcoholic beverages. Eastern Long Island is a significant producer of wines. Vineyards are most heavily concentrated on Long Island's North Fork, which contains 38 wineries. Most of these contain tasting rooms, which serve as popular tourist attractions for visitors from across the New York metropolitan area.  Long Island has also become a producer of diverse craft beers, with 15 microbreweries existing across Nassau and Suffolk counties . The largest of these is Blue Point Brewing Company, best known for its toasted lager.  Long Island is also globally known for its signature cocktail, the Long Island Iced Tea, which purportedly was invented at a popular Jones Beach nightclub in the 1970s. \n\nThe eateries on Long Island are largely a product of the region's local ethnic populations. Italian cuisine is represented by ubiquitous pizzerias spread throughout the island, with the region hosting an annual competition, the Long Island Pizza Festival & Bake-Off. Jewish cuisine is likewise represented by delicatessens and bagel stores.\n\nSports\n\nMajor league sports\n\nThe New York Mets baseball team plays at Citi Field in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens. Their former stadium, Shea Stadium was also home for the New York Jets football team from 1964 until 1983. The new stadium is designed with an exterior façade and main entry rotunda inspired by Brooklyn's famous Ebbets Field (see below). The New York Mets had planned to move their Double-A farm team to Long Island, as part of the ambitious but now-defunct plan for Nassau County called The Lighthouse Project. The Brooklyn Cyclones are a minor league baseball team, affiliated with the New York Mets. The Cyclones play at MCU Park just off the boardwalk on Coney Island in Brooklyn. An artificial turf baseball complex named Baseball Heaven is located in Yaphank.\n\nThe Barclays Center, a new sports arena, business, and residential complex built partly on a platform over the Atlantic Yards at Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, is the current home of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team and the New York Islanders hockey team. The move from New Jersey in the summer of 2012 marked the return to Long Island for the Nets franchise, which played at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale from 1972 to 1977. The Islanders played at Nassau Coliseum from their 1972 inception through 2015.\n\nEbbets Field, which stood in Brooklyn from 1913 until its demolition in 1960, was the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team, who moved to California after the 1957 Major League Baseball season to become the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers won several National League pennants in the 1940s and 1950s, losing several times in the World Series—often called Subway Series—to their Bronx rivals, the New York Yankees. The Dodgers won their lone championship in Brooklyn in the 1955 World Series versus the Yankees.\n\nDespite this success during the latter part of the team's stay in Brooklyn, they were a not-very-good second-division team for much of their history there – but nonetheless became legendary for the almost-fanatical devotion of the Brooklynites who packed the relatively small ballpark to vigorously root for the team they affectionately called \"Dem Bums.\" Loss of the Dodgers to California was locally considered a civic tragedy that negatively affected the community far more than did the similar moves of other established teams to new cities in the 1950s, including the Dodgers' long-time arch-rival New York Giants, who also left for California after 1957.\n\nMinor league and college sports\n\nLong Island is also home to the Long Island Ducks minor league baseball team of the Atlantic League. Their stadium, Bethpage Ballpark, is located in Central Islip. The two main rugby teams are the Long Island RFC in East Meadow and the Suffolk Bull Moose in Stony Brook.\n\nThe New York Dragons of the Arena Football League also played their home games at Nassau Coliseum.\n\nLong Island has a professional soccer club, the New York Cosmos, who play in the Division 2 North American Soccer League at James M. Shuart Stadium in Hempstead.\n\nLong Island has been a hot spot for outdoor lacrosse at the youth and college level, which made way for a Major League Lacrosse team in 2001, the Long Island Lizards. The Lizards play at Mitchel Athletic Complex in Uniondale.\n\nOther sports\n\nLong Island has a wide variety of golf courses that span all over. One of the most famous is the public Bethpage Black Course that has hosted multiple U.S. Open's as well as The Barclays with the most recent during the year 2012.\nQueens also hosts one of the four tennis grand slams, the US Open. Every August (September, in Olympic years) the best tennis players in the world travel to Long Island to play the championships, which is held in the USTA National Tennis Center, located adjacent to Citi Field in Flushing Meadows Park. The complex also contains the biggest tennis stadium in the world, the Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nLong Island also has two horse racing tracks, Aqueduct Racetrack in Ozone Park, Queens and Belmont Park on the Queens/Nassau border in Elmont, home of the Belmont Stakes. The longest dirt Thoroughbred racecourse in the world is located in the Nassau County community of Elmont at Belmont Park.\n\nAnother category of sporting events popular in this region are Firematic Racing events, involving many local Volunteer fire departments.\n\nNotable sportspeople and teams\n\nLong Island is home to numerous famous athletes, including Hall of Famers Jim Brown, Julius Erving, John Mackey, Whitey Ford, Nick Drahos, and Carl Yastrzemski. Others include Gold Medalists Sue Bird, Sarah Hughes and Derrick Adkins, D'Brickashaw Ferguson, Billy Donovan, Larry Brown, Rick Pitino, John McEnroe, Jumbo Elliott, Mick Foley, Zack Ryder, Matt Serra, Boomer Esiason, Vinny Testaverde, Craig Biggio, Frank Catalanotto, Greg Sacks, Rob Burnett, Steve Park, Frank Viola, Chris Weidman, Marques Colston and Speedy Claxton.\n\nSeveral current NHL players were born and/or raised on Long Island, such as Vancouver Canucks Christopher Higgins and Matt Gilroy, Nashville Predators Eric Nystrom, Toronto Maple Leaf Mike Komisarek, and Pittsburgh Penguin Rob Scuderi.  Both Komisarek and Higgins played on the same Suffolk County Hockey League team at an early age, and later played on the Montreal Canadiens together. Nick Drahos was an All Scholastic and All Long Island honoree at Lawrence High School, Nassau Co. in 1936 and 1937, and a 2-time Unanimous National College All-American in the years of 1939 and 1940 at Cornell University.",
                "New York City, in the U.S. state of New York, is composed of five boroughs. They are Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. Each borough also has coextensive boundaries as a county of New York State. The county governments were dissolved when New York City consolidated in 1898, along with all city, town, and village governments within each county. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States; these same boroughs are coextensive with the four most densely populated counties in the United States (New York [Manhattan], Kings [Brooklyn], Bronx, and Queens).\n\nThe term borough was adopted to describe a unique form of governmental administration for each of the five fundamental constituent parts of the newly consolidated city in 1898. Under New York State Law, a \"borough\" is a municipal corporation that is created when a county is merged with populated areas within it. This differs significantly from typical borough forms of government used in Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, other states, Greater London, and elsewhere.\n\nBackground\n\nNew York City is often referred to collectively as the five boroughs; the term is used to refer to New York City as a whole unambiguously, avoiding confusion with any particular borough or with the Greater New York metropolitan area. The term is also used by politicians to counter a frequent focus on Manhattan and, thereby, to place all five boroughs on equal footing. In the same vein, the term outer boroughs refers to all of the boroughs excluding Manhattan, even though the geographic center of the city is along the Brooklyn–Queens border.\n\nAll of the boroughs were created in 1898 during consolidation, when the city's current boundaries were established. The Bronx originally included parts of New York County outside of Manhattan that had previously been ceded by neighboring Westchester County in two stages, in 1874 and then following a referendum in 1894. The separate present-day Bronx County was not created until 1914, and is the last created county in the State of New York.\n\nThe borough of Queens consists of what formerly was only the western part of a then-larger Queens County. In 1899, the three eastern towns of Queens that had not joined the city the year before formally seceded from Queens County to form the new Nassau County. The borough of Staten Island was officially the borough of Richmond until the name was changed in 1975 to reflect its common appellation.\n\nDescription of the boroughs\n\nThere are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs of New York City, many with a definable history and character to call their own.\n* Manhattan (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough and is home to Central Park and most of the city's skyscrapers. Manhattan's (New York County's) population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km²) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city.  Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial center of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the United Nations Headquarters, Wall Street, and a number of important universities. Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world.  Most of the borough is situated on Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the Hudson River. Several small islands are also part of the borough of Manhattan, including Randall's Island, Wards Island, and Roosevelt Island in the East River, and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor. Manhattan Island is loosely divided into Lower, Midtown, and Uptown regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, and above the park is Harlem. The borough also includes a small neighborhood on the United States mainland, called Marble Hill.  Marble Hill was originally part of Manhattan Island, but is now contiguous with the Bronx after having been severed from the U.S. mainland by the construction of the Harlem River Ship Canal north of the neighborhood, and having been connected to the mainland by the subsequent filling in of the Harlem River's original path to the neighborhood's south. New York City's remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the outer boroughs.\n\n* Brooklyn (Kings County), on the western tip of Long Island, is the city's most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the only central core neighborhood in the outer boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the country.  Marine Park and Prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn.\n\n* Queens (Queens County), on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnically diverse county in the United States,  as well as the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Queens is the site of Citi Field, the baseball stadium of the New York Mets, and hosts the annual U.S. Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, are located in Queens. (The third is Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey.)\n\n* Staten Island (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and to Manhattan by way of the Staten Island Ferry, a free commuter ferry and popular tourist attraction which provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2500 acres, including 28 mi of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city.  Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.\n\n* The Bronx (Bronx County) is New York City's northernmost borough and the only New York City borough that is not considered an island or part of one. It is the location of Yankee Stadium, the baseball stadium of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned housing complex in the United States, Co-op City.  It is also home to the Bronx Zoo, the world's largest metropolitan zoo, which covers 265 acre and houses over 6,000 animals.  The Bronx is also the birthplace of rap and hip hop culture (needs more citation).  Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at .\n\nGovernance\n\nSince 1914, each of New York City's five boroughs has been coextensive with a county of New York State – unlike most U.S. cities, which lie within a single county or extend partially into another county, constitute a county in themselves, or are completely separate and independent of any county.\n\nEach borough is represented by a borough president. Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island each have a Borough Hall. The the Manhattan Borough President's office is situated in the Manhattan Municipal Building. The Bronx Borough President's office used to be in its own Bronx Borough Hall, but has been in the Bronx County Courthouse for decades. Since the abolition of the Board of Estimate in 1990 (due to a 1989 ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court ), the borough presidents have minimal executive powers, and there is no legislative function within a borough. Executive functions in New York City are the responsibility of the Mayor of New York City, while legislative functions reside with the New York City Council. The borough presidents primarily act as spokesmen, advocates, and ceremonial leaders for their boroughs, have budgets from which they can allocate relatively modest sums of money to community organizations and projects, and appoint the members of the 59 largely advisory community boards in the city's various neighborhoods. The Brooklyn and Queens borough presidents also appoint trustees to the local public library systems in those boroughs.\n\nBecause they are counties, each borough also elects a district attorney, as does every other county of the state. While the district attorneys of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island are popularly referred to as such by the media (e.g., \"Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance, Jr.\", or \"Brooklyn D.A. Kenneth P. Thompson\"), they are technically and legally the district attorneys of New York County, Kings County and Richmond County, respectively. There is no such distinction made for the district attorneys of the other two counties, Queens and the Bronx, since the borough shares the county's name. Because the five district attorneys are, technically speaking, state officials (since the counties are considered to be arms of the state government), rather than officials of the city government, they are not subject to the term limitations that govern other New York City officials such as the mayor, the New York City Public Advocate, members of the city council or the borough presidents.\n\nSome civil court judges also are elected on a borough-wide basis, although they generally are eligible to serve throughout the city.\n\nSixth borough\n\nThe term sixth borough is used to describe any of a number of places that have been called or likened to a part of New York City because of their geographic location, demographics, special affiliation, or cosmopolitan character. They have included adjacent cities and counties in the New York metropolitan area as well as in other states, U.S. territories, and foreign countries.    In 2011, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg referred to the city's waterfront and waterways as a composite sixth borough during presentations of planned rehabilitation projects along the city's shoreline,       including Governor's Island in the Upper New York Bay."

Her exterior and interior were designed by Terence Disdale Design and her naval architect was Francis Design. The yacht was delivered to Russian businessman Roman Abramovich on 9 December 2010. At  long, Eclipse is the world's second largest private yacht,  shorter than Azzam, which launched in April, 2013.  The yacht's cost has been estimated at €340 million. \n\nFeatures\n\nEclipse has two helicopter pads, 24 guest cabins, two swimming pools, several hot tubs, and a disco hall.  It is also equipped with three launch boats and a mini-submarine that is capable of submerging to 50 metres. Approximately 70 crew members are needed to operate the yacht and serve the guests.\n\nFor security, Eclipse is fitted with a missile defense system. \n\nEclipse is also the largest vessel employing a novel rotor-based stabilization system  against roll motion at anchor and at low cruise speeds, based on the Magnus effect. \n\nHistory\n\nEclipse was launched on 12 June 2009.  She arrived in Frederikshavn, Denmark, on 18 September 2009, for tests, and was delivered to Abramovich on 9 December 2010. First pictures of the completed yacht were taken at Kristiansand, Norway, during her refuelling. \n\nIn February 2011 Eclipse was made available for charter through SuperYachtsMonaco, a Monaco-based yacht brokerage company.  However, according to Motor Boat & Yachting magazine, the yacht is not available for actual charter, and the charter listing is aimed to avoid European taxation (charter yachts are exempt from property tax).\n\nEclipse travels to St. Martin in the Caribbean each winter to pick up passengers who fly in to St. Martin's airport. The yacht then travels to Abramovich's home on nearby St. Barth's."

                "Oświęcim (pronounced) (,  Oshpitzin) is a town in the Lesser Poland () province of southern Poland,  situated 50 km west of Kraków, near the confluence of the Vistula (Wisła) and Soła rivers. The town is best known as being the location of the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II.\n\nGeography and transport\n\nOświęcim lies on the intersection where National Road 44 meets local roads 933 and 948. Oświęcim's old town is located east of the Soła, with the Main Market Square (Rynek Główny) at its centre. The railway station is across the river, in the north west of the town, with the main museum in the west of the town. The Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum is in the village of Brzezinka, to the west of the railway station. The chemical works are located east of the town.\n\nThe main bus station of the town lies in the east of the town, and local bus services are operated by PKS Oświęcim. The PKP railway services are available to Kraków, Katowice and Czechowice-Dziedzice, and internationally to Vienna and Prague. The nearest airport is located 60 km away, at Kraków Balice. According to the 2002 data, Oświęcim is 30 km2, of which forests comprise only 1%. The neighbouring gminas are Chelmek, Libiąż, and the gmina of Oświęcim.\n\nName\n\nThe town's name is of Slavic extraction, likely deriving from the name of the owner of a Slavic gord which existed there in the Middle Ages. Across centuries, it was spelled in many different ways, and in many languages – Polish, Czech, German, Latin: Ospenchin (1217), Osvencin (1280), Hospencin (1283), Osswetem (1293), Uspencin (1297), Oswentim (1302), Wswencim (1304), Auswintzen (1312), Oświęcim (1314), Oswencin (1327), Auswieczin (1372), Awswiczin (1372), Uswiczin (1400). In the Latin language, Oświęcim was spelled Osswencimen or Osviecimensis. As the town was an important center of commerce from the late Middle Ages onwards, German-speaking merchants called it Auswintz (14th century), which by the 15th century was changed into Auschwitz. From 1772–1918, when Oświęcim belonged to the Austrian province of Galicia, both Polish and German language names were in official use. During World War II, when the town was annexed into the Third Reich, the name Auschwitz was used, to be replaced by Oświęcim after 27 January 1945, when the Wehrmacht was pushed out by the Red Army.\n\nHistory\n\nOświęcim has a rich history, which dates back to the early days of Polish statehood. It is one of the oldest castellan gords in Poland. Following the Fragmentation of Poland in 1138, Duke Casimir II the Just attached the town to the Duchy of Opole in ca. 1179 for his younger brother Mieszko I Tanglefoot, Duke of Opole and Racibórz. The town was destroyed in 1241 during the Mongol invasion of Poland. Around 1272 the newly rebuilt Oświęcim was granted a municipal charter modeled on those of Lwówek Śląski (a Polish variation of the Magdeburg Law). The charter was confirmed on 3 September 1291.\n\nIn 1281, the Land of Oświęcim became part of the newly established Duchy of Cieszyn, and in ca. 1315, an independent Duchy of Oświęcim was established. In 1327, John I, Duke of Oświęcim joined his Duchy with the Duchy of Zator, and soon afterwards,  his state was attached to the Kingdom of Bohemia (see vassal), where it remained for over a century. In 1445, the Duchy was divided into three separate entities – those of Oświęcim and Zator, as well as the Duchy of Toszek. In 1457 Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon bought the rights to Oświęcim. On 25 February 1564, King Zygmunt August issued a bill, making former Duchies of Oświęcim and Zator part of the Kingdom of Poland. Both lands were attached to the Kraków Voivodeship, making Silesian County of that province. The town later became one of the centres of Protestant culture in Poland. \n\nLike other towns of Lesser Poland, Oświęcim prospered in the period known as Polish Golden Age. Good times ended in 1655, during the catastrophic Swedish invasion of Poland. Oświęcim was burned and afterwards the town declined, and in 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), it was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of the province of Galicia, where it remained until late 1918. After the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the town was close to the borders of both Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and the Kingdom of Prussia. In the 1866 war between Austria and the Prussian-led North German Confederation, a cavalry skirmish was fought at the town, in which an Austrian force defeated a Prussian incursion.  \n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Oświęcim became an important rail junction. In the same period, the town burned in several fires, such as the fire of 23 August 1863, when two-thirds of Oświęcim  burned, including town hall and two synagogues. New town hall was built in 1872–75, and in another fire (in 1881), the parish church burned with a school and a hospital. In 1910, Oświęcim became the seat of a starosta, in 1915 a high school was opened, and in 1917–18 a new district, called Nowe Miasto, was founded. After World War I, the town became part of the Second Polish Republic's Kraków Voivodeship. Until 1932, Oświęcim was the seat of a county, but on 1 April 1932, the County of Oświęcim was divided between the County of Wadowice, and the County of Biala Krakowska. On the eve of World War II there were about 8,000 Jews in the city, over half the population.  In the early days of the Invasion of Poland, the retreating Polish Army units blew up the bridge over the Sola river. \n\nWorld War II\n\n \n\nIn October 1939, Nazi Germany immediately annexed the area to Germany in the Gau of Upper Silesia, which became part of the \"second Ruhr\" by 1944. \n\nIn 1940, Nazi Germany used forced labour to build a new subdivision to house Auschwitz guards and staff. In 1941, German authorities decided to build a large chemical plant of IG Farben, in the eastern outskirts of the town. Polish residents of several districts were forced to abandon their houses, as the Germans wanted to keep the area around Auschwitz concentration camp empty. A buffer zone with the area of some 40 km2 was planned around the camp, and expulsions of local Polish residents took place in two stages, in 1940 and 1941. All the residents of the Zasole district were forced to abandon their homes. In the Plawy and Harmeze districts, more than 90% of all buildings were destroyed and the residents of Plawy were transported to Gorlice to fend for themselves. Altogether, some 17,000 people in Oświęcim itself and surrounding villages were forced to leave their homes, and eight villages were wiped off the map. As a result, by April 1941 the population of Oświęcim shrank to 7,600. \n\nThe town and the camp were seized by the Red Army on 27 January 1945. Soviets immediately opened two temporary camps for German POWs in the complex of Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Auschwitz Soviet camp existed until fall 1945, and the Birkenau camp lasted until spring 1946. Some 15,000 Germans were interned there. Furthermore, there was a camp of Communist secret police (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa), located near the rail station, in the complex of former \"Gemeinschaftslager\". Most of its prisoners were members of the NSDAP, Hitlerjugend and BDM, as well as German civilians, the Volksdeutsche and Upper Silesians who were suspected of being disloyal to Poland. Inmates worked at a chemical plant in Monowice, where they dismantled the equipment, which was then transported to the Soviet Union.  \n\nPost-World War II\n\nAfter the territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II, new housing complexes in the town were developed with large buildings of rectangular and concrete constructions. The chemical industry became the main employer of the town and in later years, a service industry and trade were added. Tourism to the concentration camp sites is an important source of revenue for the town's businesses. In the mid-1990s following Communism's end, employment at the chemical works (former IG Farben, renamed Dwory S.A.) reduced from 10,000 in the Communist era to only 1,500 people. In 1952, the County of Oświęcim was re-created, and the town until 1975 belonged to Kraków Voivodeship. In 1975–99, it was part of Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship. In 1979, Oświęcim was visited by Pope John Paul II, and on 1 September 1980, a local Solidarity office was created at the chemical plant. On 28 May 2006, the town was visited by Pope Benedict XVI. \n\nLocal sports\n\nThe ice hockey team of TH Unia Oświęcim was crowned Polish champions 8 times .  Sports club Unia Oświęcim was established in 1946, and apart from ice-hockey, it has such departments, as swimming, figure skating, and association football (as Zasole-Unia Oświęcim). In the past, Unia had boxing, table tennis, volleyball, track and field, cycling and basketball departments. Another sports organization from Oświęcim is Sports Club Sola (established 1919). \n\nNotable people\n\nPolish figure skaters Sabina Wojtala, Dorota Siudek and Mariusz Siudek are from the town. Other notable people from the town include Rabbi Aaron Miller (father of chazzan Benzion Miller), Marian Kasperczyk (Polish-born French painter) and Victor Zarnowitz (American economist). \n\nMembers of Parliament (Sejm) elected from this constituency include Janusz Chwierut (PO), Paweł Graś (PO), Paweł Kowal (PiS), Marek Jerzy Łatas (PiS), Leszek Murzyn (LPR), Marek Polak (PiS), and Stanisław Rydzoń (SLD-UP). \n\nInternational relations\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\n\nOświęcim is twinned with:"

                "A grass court is one of the four different types of court on which the sport of tennis, originally known as \"lawn tennis\", is played. Grass courts are made of grasses in different compositions depending on the tournament. \n\nAlthough grass courts are more traditional than other types of tennis courts, maintenance costs of grass courts are higher than those of hard courts and clay courts. Grass courts (in the absence of suitable covers) must be left for the day if rain appears, as the grass becomes very slippery when wet.\n\nGrass courts are most common in Britain, although the Northeastern United States also has some private grass courts.\n\nPlay style\n\nBecause grass courts tend to be slippery, the ball often skids and bounces low while retaining most of its speed, rarely rising above knee height. In addition, there are often bad bounces. As a result, players must reach the ball faster relative to other surfaces, and rallies are likely to be comparatively brief; therefore, speed and power are rewarded on grass. On grass, the serve and return play a major part in determining the outcome of the point, increasing the importance of serving effectively, and maintaining focus in exchanges which can be heavily influenced by lapses in concentration.  A grass-court favours a serve and volley style of play.\n\nPlayers\n\nAmong the most successful players on grass in the Open Era have been Pete Sampras, Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, Björn Borg, Roger Federer, Venus Williams, Serena Williams and Billie Jean King. All have won at least five Wimbledon singles championships; Navratilova won nine, while Sampras, Graf, Serena Williams and Federer each won seven. Other players who have been relatively successful at Wimbledon are Boris Becker, John McEnroe, Stefan Edberg and Chris Evert.\n\nSampras is lauded by many tennis analysts as one of the greatest grass-court players of all time.     He won seven Wimbledon singles titles in eight years from 1993 through 2000, with his only loss in that span coming in the 1996 quarterfinals. The most successful male player currently is Roger Federer, a seven-time Wimbledon singles champion. His variety in the shots, speed, footwork, and slices, are his biggest weapons. Before being beaten in 2008 at Wimbledon by Rafael Nadal, Federer had a 65-match winning streak on grass, and 40 consecutive wins at Wimbledon alone.\n\nThe most successful female players currently playing are Serena Williams and her sister Venus Williams, with seven and five Wimbledon singles titles respectively. Venus has won five out of her eight Wimbledon finals appearances (losing the remaining three to her sister Serena) and achieving five titles in the ladies' doubles with her sister.\n\nProfessional tournaments played on grass\n\nThe professional grass court season is comparatively short. Until 2014 it consisted only of Wimbledon, two weeks of tournaments in Britain and continental Europe leading up to it, and the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in the Newport, Rhode Island, United States the week after. From 2015 it is to be extended, with an extra week between the French Open and Wimbledon. In the ATP Tour, the Stuttgart Open became a grass court tournament in 2015,  and a new grass court tournament is set to start in 2017, a week before Wimbledon.  In the WTA Tour Mallorca will host a grass court tournament beginning in 2016. \n\nSummer grass season",
                "The Championships, Wimbledon, commonly known simply as Wimbledon, is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, and is widely considered the most prestigious.      It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London since 1877. \n\nWimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open and the US Open. Since the Australian Open shifted to hardcourt in 1988, Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass.\n\nThe tournament takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Final, scheduled always for the second Saturday and Sunday of July respectively. Five major, junior, and invitational events are held each year. Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors and Royal patronage. The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain.\n\nHistory\n\nBeginning\n\nThe All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as \"The All England Croquet Club\". Its first ground was off Worple Road, Wimbledon. \n\nIn 1876, lawn tennis, a game devised by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield a year or so earlier and originally given the name Sphairistikè, was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club, was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net.\n\nThe inaugural 1877 Wimbledon Championship opened on 9 July 1877. The Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held and was won by Spencer Gore, an old Harrovian rackets player, from a field of 22. About 200 spectators paid one shilling each to watch the final. \n\nThe lawns at the ground were arranged so that the principal court was in the middle with the others arranged around it, hence the title \"Centre Court\". The name was retained when the Club moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road, although no longer a true description of its location. However, in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of the ground, which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly defined. The opening of the new No. 1 Court in 1997 emphasised the description.\n\nBy 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word \"croquet\" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899.\n\nIn 1884, the club added Ladies' Singles and Gentlemen's Doubles competitions. Ladies' Doubles and Mixed Doubles events were added in 1913. Until 1922, the reigning champion had to play only in the final, against whomever had won through to challenge him/her. As with the other three Major or Grand Slam events, Wimbledon was contested by top-ranked amateur players, professional players were prohibited from participating. This changed with the advent of the open era in 1968. No British man won the singles event at Wimbledon between Fred Perry in 1936 and Andy Murray in 2013, while no British woman has won since Virginia Wade in 1977, although Annabel Croft and Laura Robson won the Girls' Championship in 1984 and 2008 respectively. The Championship was first televised in 1937.\n\nThough properly called \"The Championships, Wimbledon\", depending on sources the event is also known as \"The All England Lawn Tennis Championships\", \"The Wimbledon Championships\" or simply \"Wimbledon\". From 1912 to 1924, the tournament was recognized by the International Lawn Tennis Federation as the \"World Grass Court Championships\".\n\n21st century\n\nWimbledon is considered the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the Club is to maintain its leadership. To that end a long-term plan was unveiled in 1993, intended to improve the quality of the event for spectators, players, officials and neighbours.  Stage one (1994–1997) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the new No. 1 Court in Aorangi Park, a broadcast centre, two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road. Stage two (1997–2009) involved the removal of the old No. 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats. Stage three (2000–2011) has been completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office. \n\nA new retractable roof was built in time for the 2009 championships, marking the first time that rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on Centre Court. The Club tested the new roof at an event called A Centre Court Celebration on Sunday, 17 May 2009, which featured exhibition matches involving Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf, Kim Clijsters and Tim Henman. The first Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women's singles match between Dinara Safina and Amélie Mauresmo.  The first match to be played in its entirety under the new roof took place between Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka on 29 June 2009, which Murray won. Murray was also involved in the match completed latest in the day at Wimbledon, which ended at 11:02 pm in a victory over Marcos Baghdatis at Centre Court in the third round of the 2012 Championships. The 2012 Men's Singles Final on 8 July 2012, between Roger Federer and Murray, was the first final to be played under the roof, which was activated during the third set.\n\nA new 4000-seat No. 2 Court was built on the site of the old No. 13 Court in time for the 2009 Championships.   A new 2000-seat No. 3 Court was built on the site of the old No. 2 and No. 3 Courts. \n\nOn 17 January 2016, it was reported The Championships at Wimbledon were among several high-level tennis tournaments being investigated for instances of alleged match-fixing. \n\nEvents\n\nWimbledon consists of five main events, five junior events and five invitation events. \n\nMain events\n\nThe five main events, and the number of players (or teams, in the case of doubles) are:\n* Gentlemen's Singles (128)\n* Ladies' Singles (128)\n* Gentlemen's Doubles (64)\n* Ladies' Doubles (64)\n* Mixed Doubles (48)\n\nJunior events\n\nThe five junior events and the number of players or teams are:\n* Boys' Singles (64)\n* Girls' Singles (64)\n* Boys' Doubles (32)\n* Girls' Doubles (32)\n* Disabled Doubles (12)\nNo mixed doubles event is held at this level.\n\nInvitation events\n\nThe five invitational events and the number of pairs are:\n* Gentlemen's Invitation Doubles (8 pairs Round Robin)\n* Senior Gentlemen's Invitation Doubles (8 pairs Round Robin) \n* Ladies' Invitation Doubles (8 pairs Round Robin)\n* Gentlemen's Wheelchair Doubles (4 pairs) \n* Ladies' Wheelchair Doubles (4 pairs)\nFrom 2016 singles draws for the existing wheelchair events were added. \n\nMatch formats\n\nMatches in the Gentlemen's Singles and Gentlemen's Doubles are best-of-five sets; all other events are best-of-three sets.  A tiebreak game is played if the score reaches 6–6 in any set except the fifth (in a five-set match) or the third (in a three-set match), in which case a two-game lead must be reached.\n\nAll events are single-elimination tournaments, except for the Gentlemen's, Senior Gentlemen's and the Ladies' Invitation Doubles, which are round-robin tournaments.\n\nUntil 1922, the winners of the previous year's competition (except in the Ladies' Doubles and Mixed Doubles) were automatically granted byes into the final round (then known as the challenge round). This led to many winners retaining their titles in successive years, as they were able to rest while their opponent competed from the start of the competition. From 1922, the prior year's champions were required to play all the rounds, like other tournament competitors.\n\nSchedule\n\nEach year the tournament begins on the last Monday in June, two weeks after the Queen's Club Championships, which is one of the men's major warm-up tournaments, together with the Gerry Weber Open, which is held in Halle, Germany, during the same week.  Other grass-court tournaments before Wimbledon are Eastbourne, England, and Rosmalen in the Netherlands, both combining mixed events. The other women's warm-up tournament for Wimbledon is Birmingham, also in England. The only grass-court tournament scheduled after the Championships is the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships at Newport, Rhode Island, USA, which takes place the week after Wimbledon.\n\nWimbledon is scheduled for 14 days, beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday. The five main events span both weeks, but the junior and invitational events are held mainly during the second week.  Traditionally, there is no play on the \"Middle Sunday\", which is considered a rest day.  However, rain has forced play on the Middle Sunday four times, in 1991, 1997, 2004 and 2016. On each of these occasions, Wimbledon staged a \"People's Sunday\", with unreserved seating and readily available, inexpensive tickets, allowing those with more limited means to sit on the show courts.\n\nSince 2015, the championships have begun one week later than in previous years, extending the gap between the tournament and the French Open from two to three weeks.  Additionally the Stuttgart Open men's tournament converted to a grass surface and was rescheduled from July to June, extending the grass court season.\n\nPlayers and seeding\n\nBoth the men's and ladies' singles consist of 128 players.  Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings, with 104 direct entries into the men's and 108 into the ladies' competitions. Both tournaments have 8 wild card entrants, with the remainder in each made up of qualifiers. Since the 2001 tournament 32 players have been given seedings in the Gentlemen's and Ladies' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events. The system of seeding was introduced during the 1924 Wimbledon Championships. This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw. This system was replaced for the 1927 Wimbledon Championships and from then on players were seeded on merit. The first players to be seeded as no. 1 were René Lacoste and Helen Wills.\n\nThe Committee of Management decide which players receive wildcards. Usually, wild cards are players who have performed well during previous tournaments, or would stimulate public interest in Wimbledon by participating. The only wild card to win the Gentlemen's Singles Championship was Goran Ivanišević in 2001. Players and pairs who neither have high enough rankings nor receive wild cards may participate in a qualifying tournament held one week before Wimbledon at the Bank of England Sports Ground in Roehampton. The singles qualifying competitions are three-round events; the same-sex doubles competitions last for only one round. There is no qualifying tournament for Mixed Doubles. The furthest that any qualifier has progressed in a Singles tournament is the semi-final round: John McEnroe in 1977 (Gentlemen's Singles), Vladimir Voltchkov in 2000 (Gentlemen's Singles), and Alexandra Stevenson in 1999 (Ladies' Singles).\n\nPlayers are admitted to the junior tournaments upon the recommendations of their national tennis associations, on their International Tennis Federation world rankings and, in the case of the singles events, on the basis of a qualifying competition. The Committee of Management determines which players may enter the four invitational events.\n\nThe Committee seeds the top players and pairs on the basis of their rankings, but it can change the seedings based on a player's previous grass court performance. Since 2002 a seeding committee has not been required for the Gentlemen's Singles following an agreement with the ATP. While the seeds are still the top 32 players according to rankings, the seeding order is determined using the formula: ATP Entry System Position points + 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months + 75% points earned for the best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that. A majority of the entrants are unseeded. Only two unseeded players have won the Gentlemen's Singles: Boris Becker in 1985 and Goran Ivanišević in 2001. In 1985 there were only 16 seeds and Becker was ranked 20th; Ivanišević was ranked 125th when he won as a Wild Card entrant, although he had previously been a finalist three times, and been ranked no. 2 in the world; his low ranking was due to having been hampered by a persistent shoulder injury for three years, which had only just cleared up. In 1996, the title was won by Richard Krajicek, who was originally unseeded (ranked 17th, and only 16 players were seeded) but was promoted to a seeded position (still with the number 17) when Thomas Muster withdrew before the tournament. No unseeded player has captured the Ladies' Singles title; the lowest seeded female champion was Venus Williams, who won in 2007 as the 23rd seed; Williams was returning from an injury that had prevented her playing in previous tournaments, giving her a lower ranking than she would normally have had. Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous occasions; the 2005 Gentlemen's Doubles champions were not only unseeded, but also (for the first time ever) qualifiers.\n\nGrounds\n\nSince 2001, the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100% perennial ryegrass. Prior to 2001 a combination of 70% ryegrass and 30% Creeping Red Fescue was used. The change was made to improve durability and strengthen the sward to better withstand the increasing wear of the modern game.  \n\nThe main show courts, Centre Court and No. 1 Court, are normally used for only two weeks a year, during the Championships, but play can extend into a third week in exceptional circumstances. The remaining 17 courts are regularly used for other events hosted by the Club. The show courts were in action for the second time in three months in 2012 as Wimbledon hosted the tennis events of the 2012 Olympic Games. One of the show courts is also used for home ties of the GB teams in the Davis Cup on occasions.\n\nWimbledon is the only Grand Slam event played on grass courts. At one time, all the Majors, except the French Open, were played on grass. The US Open abandoned grass in 1975 and the Australian Open in 1988.\n\nThe principal court, Centre Court, was opened in 1922 when the Club moved from Worple Road to Church Road. The Church Road venue was larger and was needed to meet the ever-growing public demand.\n\nDue to the possibility of rain during Wimbledon, a retractable roof was installed prior to the 2009 Championship. It is designed to close/open in about 20 minutes and will be closed primarily to protect play from inclement (and, if necessary, extremely hot) weather during The Championships.  When the roof is being opened or closed, play is suspended. The first time the roof was closed during a Wimbledon Championship match was on Monday 29 June 2009, involving Amélie Mauresmo and Dinara Safina.\n\nBecause of the summer climate in southern England, Wimbledon employs 'Court Attendants' each year, who work to maintain court conditions. Their principal responsibility is to ensure that the courts are quickly covered when it begins to rain, so that play can resume as quickly as possible once the referees decide to uncover the courts. The court attendants are mainly university students working to make summer money. Centre Court is covered by full-time groundstaff, however.\n\nThe court has a capacity of 15,000. At its south end is the Royal Box, from which members of the Royal Family and other dignitaries watch matches. Centre Court usually hosts the finals and semifinals of the main events, as well as many matches in the earlier rounds involving top-seeded players or local favourites.\n\nThe second most important court is No. 1 Court. The court was constructed in 1997 to replace the old No.1 Court, which was adjacent to Centre Court.  The old No.1 Court was demolished because its capacity for spectators was too low. The court was said to have had a unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. The new No.1 Court has a capacity of approximately 11,000.\n\nFrom 2009, a new No. 2 Court is being used at Wimbledon with a capacity for 4,000 people. To obtain planning permission, the playing surface is around 3.5m below ground level, ensuring that the single-storey structure is only about 3.5m above ground level, and thus not affecting local views.  Plans to build on the current site of Court 13 were dismissed due to the high capacity of games played at the 2012 Olympic Games. The old No.2 Court has been renamed as No.3 Court. The old No.2 Court was known as the \"Graveyard of Champions\" because many highly seeded players were eliminated there during early rounds over the years, including Ilie Năstase, John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.  The court has a capacity of 2,192 + 770 standing. In 2011 a new No.3 Court and a new Court 4 were unveiled on the sites of the old No.2 and 3 courts. \n\nAt the northern end of the grounds is a giant television screen on which important matches are broadcast. Fans watch from an area of grass officially known as the Aorangi Terrace. When British players do well at Wimbledon, the hill attracts fans for them, and is often renamed by the press for them: Greg Rusedski's followers convened at \"Rusedski Ridge\", and Tim Henman has had the hill nicknamed Henman Hill. As both of them have now retired and Andy Murray is the number 1 British player, the hill is occasionally referred to as \"Murray Mound\" or \"Murrayfield\", as a reference to his Scottish heritage and the Scottish ground of the same name, but this has largely failed to catch on – the area is still usually referred to as Henman Hill. None of these nicknames are official.\n\n;Grounds schedule\n\nThe grounds open at 10:30 am on each day. On the Centre Court, play starts at 1 pm, with exception of the final two days of the competition (Ladies' and Gentlemen's Finals), when play begins at 2 pm. On courts 2–19, play begins at noon for at least the first eight days of the competition. It then starts at 11 am for the Junior matches on the middle Saturday and during the second week.\n\nTraditions\n\nSocial commentator Ellis Cashmore describes Wimbledon as having \"a David Niven-ish propriety\", conforming to the standards of behaviour common in the 1950s. Writer Peter York sees the event as representing a particular white and affluent type of Britishness, describing the area of Wimbledon as \"a southern, well off, late Victorian suburb with a particular social character\". Cashmore has criticised the event for being \"remote and insulated\" from the changing multicultural character of modern Britain, describing it as \"nobody's idea of all-things-British\". \n\nBall boys and ball girls\n\nIn the championship games, ball boys and girls, known as BBGs, play a crucial role in the smooth running of the tournament, with a brief that a good BBG \"should not be seen. They should blend into the background and get on with their jobs quietly.\" \n\nFrom 1947 ball boys were supplied by Goldings,  the only Barnardos school to provide them. Prior to this, from the 1920s onwards, the ball boys had been provided by The Shaftesbury Children's Home.\n\nSince 1969, BBGs have been provided by local schools. As of 2008 they are drawn from schools in the London boroughs of Merton, Sutton, Kingston, and Wandsworth, as well as from Surrey.  Traditionally, Wandsworth Boys Grammar School in Sutherland Grove, Southfields and Mayfield Girls School on West Hill in Wandsworth, both now defunct, were the schools of choice for selection of BBGs. This was possibly owing to their proximity to the club. BBGs have an average age of 15, being drawn from the school years nine and ten.  BBGs will serve for one, or if re-selected, up to five tournaments, from Year Nine to Year Thirteen. \n\nStarting in 2005, BBGs work in teams of six, two at the net, four at the corners, and teams rotate one hour on court, one hour off, (two hours depending on the court) for the day's play. Teams are not told which court they will be working on the day, to ensure the same standards across all courts. With the expansion of the number of courts, and lengthening the tennis day, as of 2008, the number of BBGs required is around 250. From the second Wednesday, BBGs are told to leave the Championships, leaving around 80 on the final Sunday. Each BBG receives a certificate, a can of used balls, a group photograph and a programme when leaving. BBG service is paid, with a total of £120-£180 being paid to each ball boy\nor girl after the 13-day period depending on the number of days served. Every BBG keeps all of their kit, typically consisting of three or four shirts, two or three shorts or skorts, track suit bottoms and top, twelve pairs of socks, three pairs of wristbands, a hat, water bottle holder, bag and trainers. Along with this it is seen as a privilege, and seen as a valuable addition to a school leaver's curriculum vitae, showing discipline. BBG places are split 50:50 between boys and girls, with girls having been used since 1977, appearing on centre court since 1985. \n\nProspective BBGs are first nominated by their school headteacher, to be considered for selection. To be selected, a candidate must pass written tests on the rules of tennis, and pass fitness, mobility and other suitability tests, against initial preliminary instruction material. Successful candidates then commence a training phase, starting in February, in which the final BBGs are chosen through continual assessment. As of 2008, this training intake was 600. The training includes weekly sessions of physical, procedural and theoretical instruction, to ensure that the BBGs are fast, alert, self-confident and adaptable to situations. As of 2011, early training occurs at the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis Club Covered Courts, to the side of the Grounds, and then moves to outside courts (8, 9, 10) the week before the Championships for a feel of the grass court.\n\nColours and uniforms\n\nDark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours. However, all tennis players participating in the tournament are required to wear all-white or at least almost all-white clothing, a long-time tradition at Wimbledon.  Wearing white clothing with some colour accents is also acceptable, provided the colour scheme is not that of an identifiable commercial brand logo (the outfitter's brand logo being the sole exception). Controversy followed Martina Navratilova's wearing branding for \"Kim\" cigarettes in 1982. Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer Ralph Lauren. This marked the first time in the history of the Championships that an outside company was used to design Wimbledon clothing; the contract with Polo Ralph Lauren is set to end in 2015.\n\nReferring to players\n\nBy tradition, the \"Men's\" and \"Women's\" competitions are referred to as \"Gentlemen's\" and \"Ladies'\" competitions at Wimbledon. The junior competitions are referred to as the \"Boys'\" and \"Girls'\" competitions.\n\nPrior to 2009 female players were referred to by the title \"Miss\" or \"Mrs\" on scoreboards. As dictated by strict rule of etiquette, married female players are referred to by their husbands' names: for example, Chris Evert-Lloyd appeared on scoreboards as \"Mrs. J. M. Lloyd\" during her marriage to John Lloyd, since \"Mrs. X\" essentially designates the wife of X. This tradition has continued at least to some extent.  For the first time during the 2009 tournament, players were referred to on scoreboards by both their first and last names. \n\nThe title \"Mr\" is not used for male players who are professionals on scoreboards but the prefix is retained for amateurs, although chair umpires refer to players as \"Mr\" when they use the replay challenge. The chair umpire will say \"Mr  is challenging the call...\" and \"Mr  has X challenges remaining.\"   However, the umpires still say Miss  when announcing the score of the Ladies' matches.\n\nIf a match is being played with two competitors of the same surname (e.g. Venus and Serena Williams, Bob and Mike Bryan), the chair umpire will specify to whom they are referring by stating the player's first name and surname during announcements (e.g. \"Game, Miss Serena Williams\", \"Advantage, Mike Bryan\").\n\nRoyal Family\n\nPreviously, players bowed or curtsied to members of the Royal Family seated in the Royal Box upon entering or leaving Centre Court. In 2003, however, the President of the All England Club, His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent, decided to discontinue the tradition. Now, players are required to bow or curtsy only if HRH The Prince of Wales, or Her Majesty The Queen is present,  as was in practice during the 2010 Championships when the Queen was in attendance at Wimbledon on 24 June. \nOn 27 June 2012, Roger Federer said in his post-match interview that he and his opponent had been asked to bow towards the Royal Box as Prince Charles and his wife were present, saying that that was no problem for him. \n\nServices Stewards\n\nPrior to the Second World War, members the Brigade of Guards and retired members of the Royal Artillery performed the role of stewards. In 1946 the AELTC offered employment to wartime servicemen returning to civilian life during their demobilization leave. Initially this scheme extended only to the Royal Navy, followed by the Army in 1947 and the Royal Air Force in 1949. In 1965 London Fire Brigade members joined the ranks of stewards.  The service stewards, wearing uniform, are present in Centre Court and No.'s 1 and 2 courts.   In 2015, 595 Service and London Fire Brigade stewards attended.   Only enlisted members of the Armed Forces may apply for the role, which must be taken as leave, and half of each year's recruits must have stewarded at Wimbledon before. The AELTC pays a subsistence allowance to servicemen and women working as stewards to defray their accommodation costs for the period of the Championships. The Service Stewards are not to be confused with the 185 Honorary Stewards.\n\nTickets\n\nThe majority of centre and show court tickets sold to the general public have since 1924 been made available by a public ballot that the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club holds at the start of the year.  The ballot has always been substantially oversubscribed. Successful applicants are selected at random by a computer.  The most recent figures from 2011 suggested there were four applicants to every ballot ticket. Applications must be posted to the AELTC by mid December, the year prior to the tournament. Seats and days are allocated randomly and ballot tickets are not transferrable.\n\nThe All England Club, through its subsidiary The All England Lawn Tennis Ground plc, issues Debentures to tennis fans every five years to raise funds for capital expenditure. Fans who invest thus in the club receive a pair of tickets for every day of the Wimbledon Championships for the five years the investment lasts.  Only debenture holders are permitted to sell on their tickets to third parties and demand for debentures has increased in recent years, to such an extent that they are even traded on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nWimbledon and the French Open are the only Grand Slam tournaments where fans without tickets for play can queue up and still get seats on the three show courts on the day of the match.   Sequentially numbered queue cards were introduced in 2003. From 2008, there is a single queue, allotted about 500 seats for each court. When they join the queue, fans are handed queue cards. Anyone who then wishes to leave the queue temporarily, even if in possession of a queue card, must agree their position with the others nearby in the queue and/or a steward.\n\nTo get access to the show courts, fans will normally have to queue overnight.  This is done by fans from all over the world and, although considered vagrancy, is part of the Wimbledon experience in itself. The All-England Club allows overnight queuing and provides toilet and water facilities for campers. Early in the morning when the line moves towards the Grounds, stewards walk along the line and hand out wristbands that are colour-coded to the specific court. The wrist band (and payment) is exchanged at the ticket office for the ticket when the grounds open. General admission to the grounds gives access to the outer courts and is possible without queuing overnight. Tickets returned by people leaving early go on sale at 2:30 pm and the money goes to charity. Queuing for the show courts ends after the quarter finals have been completed.\n\nAt 2.40pm on Day Seven (Monday 28 June) of the 2010 Championships, the one-millionth numbered Wimbledon queue card was handed out to Rose Stanley from South Africa.  \n\nSponsorship\n\nWimbledon is notable for the longest running sponsorship in sports history due to its association with Slazenger who have supplied all tennis balls during the tournament since 1902.  Since 1935 Wimbledon has a sponsorship association with the Robinsons fruit drink brand. \n\nMedia\n\nRadio Wimbledon\n\nFriday before the start of the tournament. Radio Wimbledon can be heard within a five-mile radius on 87.7 FM, and also online. It operates under a Restricted Service Licence and is arguably the most sophisticated RSL annually in the UK. The main presenters are Sam Lloyd and Ali Barton. Typically they work alternate four-hour shifts until the end of the last match of the day. Reporters and commentators include Gigi Salmon, Nick Lestor, Rupert Bell, Nigel Bidmead, Guy Swindells, Lucie Ahl, Nadine Towell and Helen Whitaker. Often they report from the \"Crow's Nest\", an elevated building housing the Court 3 and 4 scoreboards which affords views of most of the outside courts. Regular guests include Sue Mappin. In recent years Radio Wimbledon acquired a second low-power FM frequency (within the grounds only) of 96.3 FM for uninterrupted Centre Court commentary, and, from 2006, a third for coverage from No. 1 Court on 97.8 FM. Hourly news bulletins and travel (using RDS) are also broadcast.\n\nTelevision coverage\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nSince 1937 the BBC has broadcast the tournament on television in the UK.  The matches covered are split between its two main terrestrial channels, BBC One and BBC Two. The BBC holds the broadcast rights for Wimbledon until 2017  and it distributes its commercial-free feed to outlets worldwide. During the days of British Satellite Broadcasting, its sports channel carried extra coverage of Wimbledon for subscribers. One of the most notable British commentators was Dan Maskell, who was known as the BBC's \"voice of tennis\" until his retirement in 1991. John Barrett succeeded him in that role until he retired in 2006. Current commentators working for the BBC at Wimbledon include British ex-players Andrew Castle, John Lloyd, Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, Samantha Smith and Mark Petchey; tennis legends such as John McEnroe, Tracy Austin, Boris Becker and Lindsay Davenport; and general sports commentators including David Mercer, Barry Davies, Andrew Cotter and Nick Mullins. The coverage is presented by Sue Barker and highlights with Claire Balding. Previous BBC presenters include Des Lynam, David Vine, John Inverdale and Harry Carpenter.\n\nThe Wimbledon Finals are obliged to be shown live and in full on terrestrial television (BBC Television Service, ITV, Channel 4, or Channel 5) by government mandate. Highlights of the rest of the tournament must be provided by terrestrial stations; live coverage (excepting the finals) may be sought by satellite or cable TV. \n\nThe BBC was forced to apologise after many viewers complained about \"over-talking\" by its commentary team during the TV coverage of the event in 2011. It said in a statement that views on commentary were subjective but that they \"do appreciate that over-talking can irritate our audience\". The BBC added that it hoped it had achieved \"the right balance\" across its coverage and was \"of course sorry if on occasion you have not been satisfied\". Tim Henman and John McEnroe were among the ex-players commentating. \n\nWimbledon was also involved in a piece of television history, when on 1 July 1967 the first official colour television broadcast took place in the UK. Four hours live coverage of the 1967 Championships was shown on BBC Two, which was the first television channel in Europe to regularly broadcast in colour. Footage of that historic match no longer survives, however the Gentlemen's Final of that year is still held in the BBC archives because it was the first Gentlemen's Final transmitted in colour.\n\nSince 2007, Wimbledon matches have been transmitted in high-definition, originally on the BBC's free-to-air channel BBC HD, with continual live coverage during the tournament of Centre Court and Court No. 1 as well as an evening highlights show Today at Wimbledon. Since the closure of BBC HD, coverage is now shown on BBC One HD and BBC Two HD.\n\nThe BBC's opening theme music for Wimbledon was composed by Keith Mansfield and is titled \"Light and Tuneful\". A piece titled \"A Sporting Occasion\" is the traditional closing theme, though nowadays coverage typically ends either with a montage set to a popular song or with no music at all. Mansfield also composed the piece \"World Champion\", used by NBC during intervals (change-overs, set breaks, etc.) and at the close of broadcasts throughout the tournament.\n\nOther countries\n\nABC began showing taped highlights of the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles Final in the 1960s on its Wide World of Sports series. NBC began covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final. In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Finals live. For the next few decades, Americans made a tradition of NBC's \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\" specials at weekends. Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from Bud Collins, whose tennis acumen and (in)famous patterned trousers were well-known to tennis fans in the USA. Collins was sacked by NBC in 2007, but was promptly hired by ESPN, the cable home for The Championships in the States. For many years NBC's primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster Dick Enberg.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1999, premium channel HBO carried weekday coverage of Wimbledon. Hosts included Jim Lampley, Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, John Lloyd and Barry MacKay among others. \n\nPreviously, weekday coverage in the United States was exclusively handled by ESPN2 during the tournament's first week.  During the tournament's second week it was split between ESPN2 and NBC.  ESPN's online service ESPN3 provides full coverage of courts not televised using BBC graphics and commentary. Since the 2012 tournament, all live coverage, including the Finals, has been exclusively on ESPN and ESPN2, marking the second major tennis championship (after the Australian Open) available in the United States exclusively on pay television (although taped highlights from the tournament were presented at weekend afternoons on sister network ABC) through 2015.  Taped coverage using the BBC world feed is aired in primetime and overnights on Tennis Channel and is branded Wimbledon Primetime.\n\nIn Ireland, RTÉ broadcast the tournament during the 1980s and 1990s on their second channel RTÉ Two, they also provided highlights of the games in the evening. The commentary provided was given by Matt Doyle a former Irish-American professional tennis player and Jim Sherwin a former RTÉ newsreader. Caroline Murphy was the presenter of the programme. RTÉ made the decision in 1998 to discontinue broadcasting the tournament due to falling viewing figures and the large number of viewers watching on the BBC.  From 2005 until 2014 TG4 Ireland's Irish-language broadcaster provided coverage of the tournament. Live coverage was provided in the Irish language while they broadcast highlights in English at night.  In 2015 Wimbledon moved to Pay TV broadcaster Setanta Sports under a 3-year agreement. \n\nIn Australia, the free-to-air Nine Network covered Wimbledon for almost 40 years but decided to drop their broadcast following the 2010 tournament, citing declining ratings and desire to use money saved to bid on other sports coverage. In April 2011, it was announced that the Seven Network, the host broadcaster of the Australian Open, along with its sister channel 7Two would broadcast the event from 2011.\n\nIn India and its Subcontinental region, it is broadcast on Star Sports.\n\nIn Canada, coverage of Wimbledon is exclusively carried by TSN (which is partially owned by ESPN).\n\nIn Mexico, the Televisa family of networks has aired Wimbledon since the early 1960s.  Presently, most weekend matches are broadcast through Canal 5 with the weekday matches broadcast on the Televisa Deportes Network.  As Mexico is six hours behind the U.K., some Canal 5 affiliates air the weekend matches as the first program of the day after sign-on.  Although Mexico had begun broadcasting in colour in 1962, Wimbledon continued to air in black and white in Mexico until colour television came to the United Kingdom in 1967.\n\nIn most of Latin America, Wimbledon airs on ESPN, as the other Grand Slam tournaments. In Brazil, SporTV has exclusive rights to the broadcast.\n\nTrophies and prize money\n\nTrophies\n\nThe Gentlemen's Singles champion is presented with a silver gilt cup 18.5 inches (about 47 cm) in height and 7.5 inches (about 19 cm) in diameter. The trophy has been awarded since 1887 and bears the inscription: \"All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Championship of the World.\" The actual trophy remains the property of the All England Club  in their museum, so the champion receives a three-quarter size replica of the Cup bearing the names of all past Champions (height 13.5 inches). \n\nThe Ladies' Singles champion is presented with a sterling silver salver commonly known as the \"Venus Rosewater Dish\", or simply the \"Rosewater Dish\". The salver, which is 18.75 inches (about 48 cm) in diameter, is decorated with figures from mythology.  The actual dish remains the property of the All England Club in their museum, so the champion receives a miniature replica bearing the names of all past Champions. From 1949 to 2006 the replica was 8 inches in diameter, and since 2007 it has been a three-quarter size replica with a diameter of 13.5 inches.\n\nThe winner of the Gentlemen's Doubles, Ladies' Doubles, and Mixed Doubles events receive silver cups. A trophy is awarded to each player in the Doubles pair, unlike the other Grand Slam tournaments where the winning Doubles duo shares a single trophy. The Gentlemen's Doubles silver challenge cup was originally from the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club and donated to the All England Club in 1884. The Ladies' Doubles Trophy, a silver cup and cover known as The Duchess of Kent Challenge Cup, was presented to the All England Club in 1949 by HRH The Princess Marina. The Mixed Doubles Trophy is a silver challenge cup and cover presented to the All England Club by the family of two-time Wimbledon doubles winner S.H. Smith. \n\nThe runner-up in each event receives an inscribed silver plate. The trophies are usually presented by the President of the All England Club, The Duke of Kent.\n\nPrize money\n\nPrize money was first awarded in 1968, the year that professional players were allowed to compete in the Championships for the first time. Total prize money was £26,150; the winner of the men's title earned £2,000 while the women's singles champion earned £750.  \n\nBefore 2007, among grand slam tournaments, Wimbledon and the French Open awarded more prize money in men's events than in women's events. In 2007, Wimbledon changed this policy, awarding the same amounts per event category to both men and women.  The decision has been controversial because women generally spend considerably less time playing on court than men (except in mixed doubles) owing to their wins being based upon best of three sets, whereas men's are based upon best of five sets.   \n\nIn 2009, a total of £12,500,000 in prize money was awarded with the singles champions receiving £850,000 each, an increase of 13.3 percent on 2008. \n\nFor the 2010 Championships, the total prize money increased to £13,725,000, and the singles champions received £1,000,000 each.\n\nFor the 2011 Wimbledon Championships it was announced that the total prize money would be £14,600,000, an increase of 6.4% from 2010.  Both male and female singles champions prize money also increased to £1,100,000, a rise of 10% since the previous year. \n\nOn 24 April 2012, it was announced that the total prize money offered at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships would be £16,060,000, an increase of 10.0% from 2011. The bulk of the increases were given to players losing in earlier rounds.  This move was in response to the growing angst among lower-ranked players concerning the inadequacy of their pay. Sergiy Stakhovsky, a member of the ATP Player Council and who was at the time ranked 68th, was among the most vocal in the push for higher pay for players who bow out in the earlier rounds. In an interview Stakhovsky intimated that it is not uncommon for lower-ranked players to be in the negative, for certain tour events, if their results weren't stellar.   This issue gained the attention of the men's \"big four\"—Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, and Rafael Nadal—as well as the Championships.\n\nOn 23 April 2013, The All England Club announced the total prize money had been increased by about 40% from 2012 to £22,560,000. The losers in the earlier singles rounds of the tournament saw a highest 62% increase in their pay while the total prize money of the doubles increased by 22%. The prize money for participants of the qualifying matches saw an increase of 41%. Sergiy Stakhovsky, a member of the  ATP Player Council, was the loudest voice for this increase.  \n\nThe 2015 prize money is £1,880,000 each for the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles winners, £340,000 each pair for the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Doubles winners, and £100,000 per pair for the Mixed Doubles winners. The total prize money awarded is £26,750,000 up 7% from the £25,000,000 in 2014.\n\nThe 2016 Wimbledon Championships saw prize money for the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles winners reach £2,000,000 for the first time. The winning pair of the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Doubles will receive £350,000, a £10,000 increase from 2015. £100,000 will be awarded to the winning pair of the Mixed Doubles competition. The total prize money of £28,100,000 is a 5% increase on the 2015 prize money.\n\nRanking points\n\nRanking points for the ATP and WTA have varied at Wimbledon through the years but at present singles players receive the following points:\n\nChampions\n\nPast champions\n\n* Gentlemen's Singles\n* Ladies' Singles\n* Gentlemen's Doubles\n* Ladies' Doubles\n* Mixed Doubles\n\nSix of the 18 female winners in the Open Era have not reached world no. 1 ranking. These are, in chronological order: Ann Haydon-Jones, Virginia Wade, Conchita Martínez, Jana Novotná, Petra Kvitová, and Marion Bartoli. Although the men ranked world no. 1 have been dominant in Wimbledon (11 of the 20 Open Era winners), four champions reached a career high of world no. 2, Arthur Ashe, Michael Stich, Goran Ivanišević, and Andy Murray. Richard Krajicek, Pat Cash, and Jan Kodeš, who reached career highs of only no. 4, have also won the singles championship.\n\nCurrent champions\n\nFile:2015_Australian_Open_-_Andy_Murray_12_(cropped).jpg|Andy Murray was the winner of the Gentlemen's Singles in 2016.

                "Muhammad completes Hegira - Sep 24, 622 - HISTORY.com\nMuhammad completes Hegira\nPublisher\nA+E Networks\nOn this day in 622, the prophet Muhammad completes his Hegira, or “flight,” from Mecca to Medina to escape persecution. In Medina, Muhammad set about building the followers of his religion–Islam–into an organized community and Arabian power. The Hegira would later mark the beginning (year 1) of the Muslim calendar.\nMuhammad, one of the most influential religious and political leaders in history, was born in Mecca around 570. His father died before he was born, and Muhammad was put under the care of his grandfather, head of the prestigious Hashim clan. His mother died when he was six, and his grandfather when he was eight, leaving him under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new head of the clan. When he was 25, Muhammad married a wealthy widow 15 years his senior. He lived the next 15 years as a merchant, and his wife gave birth to six children: two sons, who died in childhood, and four daughters.\nFrom time to time, Muhammad spent nights in a cave in Mount Hira north of Mecca, ruminating on the social ills of the city. Around 610, he had a vision in the cave in which he heard the voice of a majestic being, later identified as the angel Gabriel, say to him, “You are the Messenger of God.” Thus began a lifetime of religious revelations, which he and others collected as the Qur’an, or Koran. Muhammad regarded himself as the last prophet of the Judaic-Christian tradition, and he adopted aspects of these older religions’ theologies while introducing new doctrines. Muhammad’s monotheistic religion came to be called Islam, meaning “surrender [to God],” and its followers were Muslims, meaning “those who have surrendered.” His inspired teachings would bring unity to the Arabian peninsula, an event that had sweeping consequences for the rest of the world.\nBy 615, Muhammad had gained about 100 converts in Mecca. He spoke out against rich merchants, who he criticized as immoral in their greed, and he denounced the worshipping of idols and multiple gods, saying, “There is no god but God.” City leaders became hostile to him, and in 619 his uncle Abu Talib died and was succeeded as head of the Hashim clan by another one of Muhammad’s uncles, Abu Lahib. Abu Lahib refused to protect Muhammad, and persecution of the prophet and his Muslims increased.\nIn the summer of 621, an entourage of 12 men came to Mecca from Medina, an oasis community 200 miles to the north. They were ostensibly making a pilgrimage to Mecca’s pagan shrines, but they had actually come to meet with Muhammad and profess themselves as Muslims. In 622, a larger group of converts from Medina came to Mecca and took an oath to Muhammad to defend him as their own kin. Muhammad immediately encouraged his Meccan followers to make their way to Medina in small groups. When city authorities learned that the Muslims had begun an exodus, they plotted to have the prophet killed. Under this threat, Muhammad slipped away unnoticed with a chief disciple and made his way to Medina, using unfrequented paths. He completed the celebrated Hegira (Hijrah in uncorrupted Arabic) on September 24, 622. The history of Islam had begun.\nAt Medina, Muhammad built a theocratic state and led raids on trading caravans from Mecca. Attempts by Meccan armies to defeat the Muslim forces failed, and several leading Meccans immigrated to Medina and became Muslims. Muhammad later become more conciliatory to Mecca, and in 629 he was allowed to lead a pilgrimage there in exchange for a peace treaty. Shortly after, he was attacked by allies of the Meccans, and Muhammad denounced the treaty. In January 630, he returned to his birthplace with 10,000 men, and the Meccans swore allegiance to its Muslim conquerors. He was now the strongest man in Arabia. During the next few years, most of the peninsula’s disparate Arab tribes came to him to ask for alliance and to convert to his religion. By his death, on June 8, 632, Muhammad was the effective ruler of most of Arabia, and his rapidly growing empire was poised for expansion into Syria and Iraq.\nWithin 20 years, the Byzantine and Persian empires had fallen to the prophet’s successors, and during the next two centuries vast Arab conquests continued. The Islamic empire grew into one of the largest the world has ever seen, stretching from India, across the Middle East and Africa, and up through Western Europe’s Iberian peninsula. The spread of Islam continued after the fragmentation of the Arab empire, and many societies in Africa and Asia voluntarily adopted Muhammad’s religion. Today, Islam is the world’s second-largest religion.\nRelated Videos",

He was also well respected within the Meccan          religious community. For 15 years, this did not          change.\nBut when he was 40, Muhammad heard the word of God while on a          retreat in the hills outside Mecca. The angel Gabriel          appeared to Muhammad and told him that he was God's chosen          messenger. Further, Muhammad received his first revelation          from God.\nWhen Muhammad told Khadij, his wife, what he had learned, she          converted to Islam. Muhammad received revelations again and          again, and he began to preach the new religion. The first          audiences were his family and friends. Then, he started          speaking in public.\nAt first, Muhammad was largely ignored. But as his following          and respect grew, the religious leaders in Mecca tried to          discourage Muhammad from preaching this new religion. The          threat of violence led Muhammad to flee Mecca.\nWhile his faith and following were growing, word was spreading of          this new religion and its prophet. Tribes of people living          in the city of Yathrib, about 200 miles north of Mecca,          invited Muhammad to live with them.\nIt must have been difficult for Muhammad to leave his home, but          leave he did. He fled from Mecca in the middle of the night.          It was the hegira. The year was 622.\nThe name of the city of Yathrib was changed to Medina, \"the city          of the prophet.\" Muhammad's following grew ever larger. Word          of his popularity reached Mecca and elsewhere in the Arabian          Peninsula. Many people embraced the new religion; many          others did not. Fighting broke out.\nThe fighting lasted for several years, until 630, when the          forces of Muhammad and Medina defeated the forces of Mecca.          The message and mission of Islam now spread more quickly          than ever.\nMuhammad died in 632, but not before the whole of the Arabian          Peninsula was united in devotion to Islam.\nWhat began as a desperate dash to freedom in the middle of the          night had become a powerful religious movement that would          soon claim followers around the globe.",
                "Muhammad and the Faith of Islam [ushistory.org]\n4i. Muhammad and the Faith of Islam\ncourtesy Muslim Students Association, University of Southern California\nThis verse from the Qur'an, originally written in Arabic, translates \"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\" (Qur'an 48:29)\nA man meditating alone in a cave near Mecca received a religious vision. This vision laid the foundations for a new religion. The year was 610 and the man's name was Muhammad.\nAnd the belief system that arose from Muhammad's ideas became the basis of one of the world's most widely practiced religions: Islam.\nMuhammad was born around 570 in the city of Mecca, located on the Arabian Peninsula. Both of his parents died before Muhammad was six and he was raised by his grandfather and uncle. His family belonged to a poor clan that was active in Mecca politics.\nFollowing the traditions of wealthy families, he spent part of his childhood living with a Bedouin family. Bedouins led fairly isolated lives as nomadic herders in the harsh Arabian desert. Muhammad's experiences among these people most likely had a strong influence on the development of Islam.\nIn his twenties, Muhammad began working as a merchant and soon married his employer, a rich woman named Khadijah. Over the next 20 years he became a wealthy and respected trader, traveling throughout the Middle East. He and his wife had six children — two boys (who did not live into adulthood) and four girls. By the time he was 40, he began having religious visions that would change his life.\nThis is prophet Muhammad's mosque in Medina.\nA Revelation of Faith\nWhile meditating in a cave on Mount Hira, Muhammad had a revelation. He came to believe that he was called on by God to be a prophet and teacher of a new faith, Islam, which means literally \"submission.\"\nThis new faith incorporated aspects of Judaism and Christianity. It respected the holy books of these religions and its great leaders and prophets — Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and others. Muhammad called Abraham \"Khalil\" (\"God's friend\") and identified him as Islam's ancient patriarch. Islam traces its heritage through Abraham's son Ishmael.\nMuhammad believed that he himself was God's final prophet.\nCentral to Islamic beliefs are the Five Pillars of Faith, which all followers of Islam — called Muslims — must follow::\nThere is only one universal God: Allah.\nFollowers of Islam (Muslims) are expected to pray five times each day while facing Mecca.\nAll Muslims are expected to pay a yearly tax that is mostly intended to help the poor and needy.\nFor the entire month of Ramadan, Muslims must not eat, smoke, drink, or have sexual relations from sunrise to sunset.\nAll able Muslims must make a pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca at least once in their lifetimes.\nThe Kaaba\nMecca houses Islam's holiest site, the Kaaba, which was believed to have been built for Yahweh by Abraham and his son Ishmael.\nIslam spread at almost Internet-like speed, encompassing much of the former territories of the ancient Near East, North Africa, and Spain.\nMuhammad's message was especially well received by the poor and slaves. But many people were opposed to his message. This opposition only seemed to make him more determined. After years of publicly promoting his ideas, he became so disliked that some began plotting his murder.\nFrom Mecca to Medina and Back\nIn 622, fearing for his life, Muhammad fled to the town of Medina. This flight from Mecca to Medina became known as the Hegira, Arabic for \"flight.\" The Muslim calendar begins on this year.\nIn Medina, the local people welcomed Muhammad and his followers. There, Muhammad built the first mosque, or Islamic temple, and began to work to separate Islam from Judaism and Christianity, which had originally influenced him.\nWhereas his followers had originally prayed while facing toward Jerusalem, he now had them face toward Mecca. Muhammad continued to have revelations from Allah. The ideas from these revelations formed the basis of a poetic text called the Koran, which contains the fundamental ideas of Islam.\nMuhammad fought a number of battles against the people of Mecca. In 629, Muhammad returned to Mecca with an army of 1500 converts to Islam and entered the city unopposed and without bloodshed. Before his death two years later, he forcefully converted most of the Arabian Peninsula to his new faith and built a small empire.\nJihad\nBelief in jihad is a common thread to many Islamic sects. Although the exact meaning of the Arabic is difficult to express in English, jihad is most accurately translated as \"struggle.\"\nFor most Muslims, jihad is a personal struggle against evil. The holy battles of this spiritual struggle are fought inside Muslims' minds and souls.\nSometimes, the struggle can take the form of a physical war against non-believers. Although this kind of jihad is referred to in English as a \"holy war,\" most Muslims believe there is nothing holy about war and that wars should only be fought against oppressors and aggressors.\nA minority of Muslims, however, places great importance on holy war jihads. This minority feels that Muslims must wage war against all nonbelievers. It is this conception of jihad that inspires Islamic extremist terrorism. Unfortunately, due to media coverage, this is the interpretation of jihad that most Westerners are familiar with.\nIt should be reiterated that mainstream Islam is peaceful and rejects the idea of unprovoked war. Although the concept of jihad is widespread, it has not been accepted by the general Islamic community as one of the Pillars of Islam.\nUnfortunately, Muhammad had not designated a successor. The struggle over leadership that followed his death has divided Muslims to this day, creating a division in Islam between the Sunnis and Shiites.\nDespite these problems, a vast Islamic empire was created over the next 12 centuries that would build a base of worshipers unrivaled by any other religion.",

This aroused the hostility of the merchant leaders of his native city, who derived much of their wealth from pilgrimages to Mecca and its surrounding cities.

Calendars of the lunar Hegira are used in many countries of the Near and Middle East and in certain other countries; calendars of the solar Hegira are used in Iran, Afghanistan, Turkey, and elsewhere. When converted to the Gregorian system, the beginning of the lunar Hegira corresponds to July 16, 622, and that of the solar Hegira to Mar. 20–21, 622, the vernal equinox.\nThe Muslim lunar year contains 354 days, and the distribution of days by month in the Hegira calendars differs from the distribution in the Gregorian calendar (used virtually throughout the world), so that the translation of dates from the Hegira to the Gregorian system and vice versa requires special formulas and tables. For example, the year 1976 of the Gregorian calendar corresponds to 1396/1397 of the lunar Hegira and to 1355/1356 of the solar Hegira.\nREFERENCES",
                "Interesting People - Muhammad\nInteresting People\n\"Ascent of the Prophet to Heaven\"\n(Persian, c.1550)\nIslamic tradition holds that images of       religious figures encourage idolatry and,       hence, detract from the proper worship of       Allah.  For this reason, you will find few       paintings or drawings of Muhammad.  In the       well-known painting above, the face of the       principal figure is not shown.  In this way,       the painting symbolizes, rather than       illustrates the Prophet.\nThis particular painting depicts the Night       Journey (see text), during which Muhammad       rode a creature called a Buraq from Earth to       heaven and back.\nWhen an historical figure has religious     importance, it is difficult to separate fact     from myth; to true believers, historical     accuracy is less important than dogma. This is     certainly the case with Muhammad (c.570-632),     the prime mover in the establishment of Islam.     For this reason, verifiable details about the     life of Muhammad are sketchy.\nWe know that he was born around 570 in Mecca,     a city near the coast of the Red Sea in what     is now Saudi Arabia. Muhammad's father died     several weeks before Muhammad was born, and     his mother died when the young boy was only 6     years old. Muhammad went to live with his     paternal grandfather, but when the old man     died two years later, Muhammad was raised by     his paternal uncle, Abu Talib. For the next 40     years, Abu Talib acted as a surrogate father,     taking care of Muhammad and lending him     support.\nAs a young man, Muhammad was a businessman,     managing a caravan that transported goods to     Syria. Over time, Muhammad earned a reputation     for honesty and kindness and, eventually, he     caught the eye of the owner of the caravan, a     wealthy, twice-widowed woman named Khadijah.     Although Muhammad was only 25 years old and     Khadijah was 40, she had intermediaries     propose marriage. Muhammad accepted, and the     marriage was long-lasting and successful.     Indeed, in Khadijah's lifetime, Muhammad did     not take any other brides, which was unusual     in a culture where men routinely practiced     polygamy.\nIn time, Khadijah bore Muhammad five, six or     seven children (depending on which version of     Muhammad's life you believe). Unfortunately,     all of Muhammad's children but one, a daughter     named Fatima, died in his lifetime. The boys,     in fact, all died at an early age, an     especially devastating tragedy in a     patriarchal society. Moreover, of the     daughters, only Fatima had children who lived     past infancy. Hence, it is only through Fatima     that Muhammad had descendents.\nBy the time Muhammad was 40 years old, in the     year 610, he was making regular retreats to     Mount Hira in order to be alone and to     meditate. According to Islamic tradition, on     one such trip, Muhammad heard the voice of the     angel Gabriel, who spoke to Muhammad with the     word of God. The first message God gave     Muhammad was the same message he had given to     Abraham in the Old Testament: that there is     only one true God, that all other gods are     false, and that he (Abraham/Muhammad) must     spread the word. From time to time, during the     rest of his life, Muhammad received many     messages from God, all via Gabriel. These     messages revealed many details regarding God's     wishes and advice and, eventually, they were     written down in the Moslem holy book, the     Qur'an. As such, God's revelations to Muhammad     form the basis of Islam.\nNotice the difference between what Moslems     believe about Muhammad and what Christians     believe about Jesus. Christians believe that     Jesus was divine, the actual son of God.     Moslems believe that Muhammad was a mortal     man, not at all divine. Rather, they see     Muhammad as a prophet, in fact, the last and     most important of the great prophets (such as     Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus). Thus, it came     to be that, in 610, at the age of 40, Muhammad     began to preach monotheism.\nOne of the most important verses of the Qur'an     (Surah 17:1) leads to an interesting story     about Muhammad. The actual verse (loosely     translated) is: \"Praise be to Him who took His     servant by night from the sacred mosque in     Mecca to the most distant mosque, whose     environs we did bless, so that we might show     him some of our signs, for He is the     All-Hearing and All-Seeing One.\" Islamic     tradition embellishes this verse into the     miraculous \"Night Journey\":\nOne night, Muhammad, accompanied by the angel     Gabriel, flew on the back of a winged,     horse-like creature to Jerusalem to visit the     temple that was built by King Solomon (who, by     the way, is also considered to be one of the     prophets). At the Temple, Muhammad prayed with     Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Muhammad was then     carried up to heaven by Gabriel, where     Muhammad met God. Because of this trip,     Moslems consider Jerusalem to be the third     most holy city, after Mecca and Medina (see     below). Within Jerusalem lies one of Islam's     most holy sites, the Dome of the Rock, which     covers the place where Muhammad is said to     have stepped as he began his ascent to heaven.     During the Night Journey, Muhammad was told     several tenets that he incorporated into the     basis of Islam, for example, that all Moslems     should pray five times a day.\nIn 619, Muhammad once again suffered terrible     losses. Both his beloved wife, Khadija, and     his uncle, Abu Talib, died. In 620, at the age     of 50, Muhammad took a new wife, A'isha and,     later, he was to take even more wives.\nDuring his years of preaching, Muhammad taught     that there was only one true God. However, it     took a long time for Muhammad to attract     followers.\nDuring his years of preaching, Muhammad taught     that there was only one true God. However, the     prevailing religion was polytheistic (many     gods), and it took a long time for Muhammad to     attract followers. Indeed, for the next     several years, Muhammad gained only a few     converts but made many enemies.\nIn 622, after discovering a plan to     assassinate him, Muhammad fled to the north,     from Mecca to the city of Yathrib, now called     Medina. Medina, like Mecca, is also in modern     day Saudi Arabia. Ever since that time, Mecca     and Medina were the two holiest cites of     Islam.\nMuhammad's flight to Medina is called the     \"Hegira\", and it is considered to be the     beginning of the Moslem calendar. For example,     the year 2006 A.D. in the secular calendar     corresponds to the year 1427 A.H. (after     Hegira) in the Moslem calendar. (Note: The     Moslem year is based on 12 lunar cycles, a bit     over 354 days. For this reason, the Moslem     months shift every year with respect to the     secular calendar.)\nIn Medina, Muhammad was more successful in     converting people to the new religion. Islam     flourished, and Muhammad was able to build a     theocratic state by combining his religious     leadership with political power, a model that     would be adopted with great success by later     Islamic empires. Indeed, even to this day,     devout Moslems believe that there should be no     separation between Islam and the political     state.\nOver the next few years, Muhammad enlarged his     army and engaged in conflict with Mecca. In     630, Mecca fell to the Muslims. Strategically,     Muhammad ordered a general amnesty for all     Meccans, which won their loyalty and, within a     short time, Mecca became an Islamic city. In     631, Muhammad made a deal with the local     Christians and Jews to bring them under Muslim     protection. However, they were required to pay     a special tax, called the jizya, that was     demanded of all non-Muslims.\nIn 632, Muhammad led the very first pilgrimage     to Mecca. However, three months after the     pilgrimage, Muhammad unexpectedly became sick     and, at the age of 62, he died. At the time of     his death, Muhammad was survived by 10 wives     and several children. However, as I mentioned     earlier, only one child, Fatima, would have     children of her own.\nSince his death, Muhammad has been revered by     Moslems as the last of the great prophets.     Everything about him  his writing, the     myths, and every detail of his life  is     also revered. It is common, for example, for     Muslims to say or write the words \"Peace be     unto him\" or \"(pbuh)\" every time Muhammad's     name is mentioned. For example. you might     read, \"Muhammad (pbuh) grew up in Mecca.     Later, Muhammad (pbuh) moved to Medina.\" An     interesting measure of Muhammad's influence is     that, today, there are more male children in     the world given the name Muhammad than any     other name.\nWeb:",

While he was gaining only enemies at home, Muhammad's teaching was faring little better abroad; only at Yathrib did it make any headway, and on Yathrib depended the future of Islam.

Muhammad's lawgiving at Medina is at least theoretically the law of Islam, and in its evolution over the next 10 years the history of the community at Medina is seen.\nMedina lies on the caravan route N of Mecca, and the Kuraishites of Mecca could not endure the thought of their outlawed relative taking vengeance on his native city by plundering their caravans. A pitched battle between Muhammad's men and the Meccans occurred at Badr, and the victory of an inferior force from the poorer city over the men of Mecca gave Islam great prestige in SW Arabia. More than a year later the battle of Uhud was fought but with less fortunate results. By this time pagan Arabia had been converted, and the Prophet's missionaries, or legates, were active in the Eastern Empire, in Persia, and in Ethiopia.\nAs he believed firmly in his position as last of the prophets and as successor of Jesus, Muhammad seems at first to have expected that the Jews and Christians would welcome him and accept his revelations, but he was soon disappointed. Medina had a large Jewish population which controlled most of the wealth of the city, and they steadfastly refused to give their new ruler any kind of religious allegiance. Muhammad, after a long quarrel, appropriated much of their property, and his first actual conquest was the oasis of Khaibar, occupied by the Jews, in 628. The failure of several missions among the Christians made him distrustful of Christians as well as Jews.\nHis renown increased, and in 629 he made a pilgrimage to Mecca without interference. There he won valuable converts, including Amr and Khalid (who had fought him at Uhud). In 630 he marched against Mecca, which fell without a fight. Arabia was won.

At that time, Mecca was a commercial center, a cosmopolitan city filled with the hustle and bustle of caravans transporting fabulous wealth from Arabia all the way to Spain in the west and India in the east. It was also a city rich in sacred sites. The people had a vague idea that Abraham had traveled to Mecca with his son Ishmael. The Qur'an would later describe how the two of them had purified God's house, rebuilding the Kaaba (shrine) that had been destroyed by Noah's flood, but at this time it was a legend known only to a few. The black stone (probably a meteor; see Black Stone), which had fallen from heaven when Earth was cursed following the expulsion from Eden, was here. Even though the world had since experienced fifteen hundred years of ignorance, during which time God had tried in vain to get his unfaithful people to submit to his decrees, Mecca was full of religion. Situated right between two great world civilizations, the Byzantine and the Persian, almost every religion on Earth had been carried here by world travelers. Judea was not far away, and many Jews had fled here following the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Damascus, Caesarea, Antioch, and Alexandria were all flourishing Christian centers.\nChristianity itself had recently been weakened by internal arguments about the nature of God. Christians couldn't seem to agree whether God was a trinity, three natures in one God, or a unity. Arguments, violent at times, were common when one camel driver would swear by the One, another would swear by the Three, and then both would begin swearing at each other. The fiercely monotheistic Zoroastrianism had its adherents, and many Bedouin people worshiped Allah, \"the God,\" while recognizing many other local and cosmic Jinns (genies) as well. The moon, sun, trees, and sacred springs—like the mysterious well called Zamzam—all had their own spirits. At two special times during the year, all intertribal warfare ceased so that people could make a pilgrimage to Mecca, run back and forth between the two holy mountains, visit the standing stones, and participate in religious festivals.\nAll this is not to say there was any deeply held conviction about translating religion into ethical behavior. The people may have developed some highly sophisticated mathematics and poetry, but life was often violent, robbery was common, and even the most trivial incidents could spark tribal war that would last for generations.\nThe time was ripe for a new religion that would unify the Arabian tribes and bring order out of chaos while satisfying the spiritual hunger of the people.\nIn the midst of this volatile environment, a man named 'Abd al-Muttalib, who had a number of different wives from different clans, went searching for a bride for one of his sixteen children. For his son 'Abdallah he obtained a woman named Amina. The newlyweds had only one child, and they named him Muhammad. 'Abdallah died, probably during Amina's pregnancy, so mother and child were left impoverished. Following the custom at such times, the child was given to a Bedouin clan so he could be introduced to desert culture. Muhammad was reunited with his mother when he was five years old, but she died soon after, so he grew up with his grandfather's people. It must have been an exciting life for a young child. At least once he traveled with a caravan all the way to Syria. After that it was only natural for Muhammad to find employment in the caravan trade. He soon began to work for a wealthy widow who owned her own caravan \"company,\" and it was not long before he so impressed his new boss that she married him. He was twenty-five years old and just starting out. She was fifteen years older than he, but she soon bore him six children, two of whom died in infancy. Muhammad was now a respected member of Meccan society and might have remained a wealthy caravan merchant all his life were he not given to deep, spiritual contemplation. His wife's money allowed him the luxury of time to ponder religion and spirituality. He took to going out alone into the hills to spend hours, and then days, seeking God in the solitude of a cave on Mount Hira. On one of those trips his prayers were answered in a way even he could never have imagined. And the world has never been the same.\nMuslim tradition later would reveal that God had had his hand on this man from the very beginning. Mystical stories surround his conception and birth. 'Abdallah, it was recounted, had \"a white blaze\" between his eyes when he \"went in to Amina,\" but it disappeared when Muhammad was conceived. The light of prophecy had been passed to the next generation. During Amina's pregnancy, a light shone from her that was so bright it could be seen as far away as Syria. At Muhammad's birth, two angels came to open his breast and clean his heart. They proceeded to put him on scales, balancing his life against one, then ten, then a hundred other men. Finally one angel cried out, \"Leave him alone, for by God, if you weighed him against all his people he would outweigh them.\" A Christian monk named Bahira was said to have traveled to see him, discovering in the process that a \"seal of prophecy\" rested between Muhammad's shoulders.\nThese stories may sound fantastic, but they are no different from medieval stories surrounding the early years of Jesus, the Buddha, and Moses. They are typical of the legends that grow up around heroes.\nWhether or not any of these things really happened, the story of Muhammad is spectacular enough to stand on its own. He was a deeply spiritual man who cared about God and understood that something needed to be done about the religious chaos of his times. Only a few men in history have been set apart to begin world religions or teach new ways of responding to the divine. Muhammad was one of them.\nThe Qur'an Revealed\nWhen Muhammad was about forty years old he returned home late one night during the month of Ramadan. He had been visiting his cave of meditation and was deeply moved. He is reported to have said to his wife, \"Cover me, Khadija, cover me!\" He had had a vision. The angel Gabriel had appeared to him.\nHe came to me while I was asleep, with a coverlet of brocade whereon was some writing, and said, \"Read!\"\nI said, \"What shall I read?\"\nHe pressed me with it so tightly that I thought it was death; then he let me go and said, \"Read!\"\nI said, \"What shall I read?\"\nHe pressed me with it so tightly that I thought it was death; then he let me go and said, \"Read!\"\nI said, \"What shall I read?\"\nHe pressed me with it the third time so that I thought it was death and said, \"Read!\"\nI said, \"What shall I read?\"—and this I said only to deliver myself from him, lest he should do the same to me again.\nHe said,\n\"Read in the name of thy Lord who created, Who created man of blood coagulated. Read! Thy Lord is most beneficent, Who taught by the pen, Taught that which they knew not unto men.\" (Qur'an 96:1-5)\nThroughout Muhammad's life he would continue to have these revelations. He would memorize them and later dictate them to a scribe who wrote them on parchment, stone, leaves, or anything else handy. Collected after Muhammad's death and bound in one volume, the world knows them today as the Qur'an, the holy scripture of Islam.\nThis kind of inspired writing is called oracular scripture. The words are understood by believers to come directly from the lips of God. Such is the holiness of such transcription that the words are never to be changed, even through translation. Many say they have read the Qur'an, but, according to Muslim tradition,\nunless they have read it in the original Arabic, they have not read it. All they have read is a translation. All quotations that claim to come from the Qur'an are not really holy scripture because they are translations, not the original as dictated from God through his angel.\nThe Early Years\nAs Muhammad grew in spiritual insight, it was only natural that he would try to teach his Meccan neighbors what he felt was Allah's message for them. But they refused to accept his teachings. His sermons were ridiculed. Although his wife, Khadija, believed him, along with his friend Abu Bakr, his cousin Ali, and Zayd, a freed slave, no one else would listen. After three years, the great world religion that was to become known as Islam had gained a total of about forty followers.\nGod had told Muhammad to preach ethical behavior. The people of Mecca were to give up the worship of false gods. They were to abstain from promiscuity and lust. They were to live virtuous lives, treating each other with fairness and kindness.\nThe reaction in the streets of Mecca was easy to predict. Such a manner of life would be bad for business. A lot of wealthy people had a lifestyle they enjoyed. They liked lust. Promiscuity was fun. Kindness was for wimps. Warfare was wholesome desert behavior. Muhammad? Who was he to try changing a way of life they had lived for centuries?\nMuhammad preached at fairs and public meetings. He endured the taunts and jeers, eventually having to dodge rocks and stones thrown at him in anger. No one listened to him. The people wanted proof. They wanted to see a miracle.\n\"You have seen a miracle,\" was Muhammad's reply. \"It is the Holy Qur'an.\"\n\"Not enough!\" growled the crowds. And he was threatened with even more violence. They even tried to buy him off, but Muhammad insisted he wanted neither silver nor gold nor power. He just wanted them to repent and submit to the will of Allah.\nIn the midst of all this Muhammad continued to receive visions. One night Gabriel came to him, riding the magnificent steed al-Buraq, \"white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule.\" Muhammad was taken to the \"farthest mosque,\" and on to the seventh heaven wherein dwelt God himself. The first six levels were guarded by tested and famous personages such as Adam, Aaron, Moses, and Abraham. This mystical experience has become, for Muslims, a metaphor or model for the experience of the spiritual presence of God.\nIslam Begins\nFinally, in 622 CE, Muhammad realized he had to leave Mecca and establish a base somewhere else. The oasis town of Medina, about two hundred miles north of Mecca, had expressed an interest in the Prophet's message. On September 24, 622, Muhammad made his Hijrah, his pilgrimage, from Mecca to Medina. This is the date Islam is said to have begun, the first day of the Muslim calendar and the date from which all other time is measured. Muslims mark their calendar years AH, anno hegirae, \"after the Hijrah.\"\nThose who migrated with Muhammad were known as Muhajirun, the \"emigrants.\" Those from Medina who received him were the Ansar, the \"helpers.\" Together, they formed the community of Islam, the Ummah.\nBut there were those, even in Medina, who refused to accept Muhammad. The Jewish community understandably proved hostile to a new prophet. So most of the Jews were eventually expelled from the town. Some people accepted Muhammad's message only superficially and later came to be known as the party of the Hypocrites. Even within the faith there were disagreements. Some Ansar thought they were being treated less honorably than the Muhajirun.\nMuhammad, however, continued to receive revelations, and Islam began to thrive. In only two years Muhammad felt the time was ripe to win Mecca to the true faith. The battle favored the Meccan army. Outnumbered three to one, the Islamic cause seemed to be lost. But the Prophet had received a message:\nAssuredly God will defend those who believe; surely God loves not any ungrateful traitor. Leave is given to those who fight because they were wronged—surely God is able to help them—who were expelled from their habitations without right, except that they say \"Our Lord is God.\" (Qur'an 22:38-40)\nIn the battle of Badr, God gave the Medina Muslims victory. This was the turning point for the Muslim community, the proof that Allah would carry out his divine will through Muhammad and the new faith of Islam. The Arabian tribes were finally united. The jihad, the holy war against apostasy, had begun. Damascus fell in 635, Persia a year later, Jerusalem two years after that. Egypt, Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, India, even some of China soon followed. Europe remained free of Muslim control only because Charles Martel turned back the Islamic \"desert riders\" at the famous battle of Tours in 732.\nMuhammad, meanwhile, continued to lead the new religion through moral example and extremely persuasive preaching. Emissaries were sent everywhere in the known world. \"People of the Book,\" Jews and Christians, were asked to submit to the God they had ignored. The Holy Prophet's message was clear. There was to be no warfare, no killing, unless people simply refused to obey the commands of Allah. Only then was warfare justified.\nMuhammad himself destroyed the idols of Mecca. His armies did the rest. Allah finally received the respect he deserved.\nIn March of 632 Muhammad made his final pilgrimage to Mecca. The city had by now been purged of all idolatry. Many of the ancient practices were now given new meaning. The people still circled the Kaaba seven times. They still kissed the Black Stone and ran back and forth between the two hills. They still threw pebbles at the stone pillars and drank from the sacred well of Zamzam. But these activities no longer were considered pagan rituals. They were now the sacred response of submission to Allah.\nShortly after returning to Medina, Muhammad became sick. Some say it was an aftereffect of an earlier assassination attempt by outraged members of the Jewish community. Others dismiss such a claim. Whatever it was, Muhammad recognized he was dying. In what proved to be his final sermon, he said:\nO men, the fire is kindled, and rebellions come like the darkness of night. By God, you can lay nothing to my charge. I allow only what the Qur'an allows and forbid only what the Qur'an forbids.\nA few hours later, in June of 632 (AH 10), he died in the arms of his young wife, 'Aisha. A mosque was later built to mark the place of his burial.\nThe people naturally were confused. A messianic rumor began to circulate that somehow he would come back to life and return to lead the Muslim movement.\nBut Abu Bakr put such talk to rest. At Muhammad's funeral service, according to Robert S. Ellwood and Barbara A. McGraw in Many Peoples, Many Faiths, Abu Bakr cried out to the faithful:\nO ye people, if anyone worships Muhammad, Muhammad is dead, but if anyone worships Allah, he [Allah] is alive and dies not!\nMuhammad was not divine or a son of God. He was simply a prophet. In this sense he is a model for every Muslim. He lived his life in submission to Allah, as all Muslims are called to do. He considered his religion to be the continuing evolution of Judaism into Christianity, and Christianity into Islam. During his final pilgrimage to Mecca he summed up his philosophy and outlined a path into the future:\nI have left you with something which if you hold fast to it you will never fall into error—a plain indication, the book of God and the practice of His prophet, so give good heed to what I say. Know that every Muslim is a Muslim's brother, and that the Muslims are brethren.\nMuhammad\n \n(also Mohammed; in European writings, often Mahomet or Mahomed). Born circa 570, in Mecca; died June 8, 632, in Medina. Religious leader and political figure; founder of Islam.\nContemporary sources for the life of Muhammad have not survived; the first biography was compiled by ibn Ishaq in the eighth century. A member of the aristocratic but impoverished Banu-Hashim family of the Quraysh clan, Muhammad was orphaned at an early age. As a shepherd and later as a merchant’s assistant, Muhammad became acquainted with Judeo-Christian monotheism and other religious and political doctrines both in Arabia and abroad. Marriage to Khadija, a wealthy Meccan woman of the merchant class, enabled Muhammad to devote himself exclusively to religious and ethical problems. According to legend, around 609 or 610, Muhammad, who frequently spent many hours in meditation on Mount Hira, near Mecca, was visited one night in the month of Ramadan by the angel Gabriel, who revealed to him certain parts of a book, called Koran in Arabic, that was kept in heaven under the throne of Allah. In the name of Allah, Gabriel charged Muhammad with conveying the commands of the Almighty to his fellow countrymen.\nThe sympathetic support of his family and friends, particularly Khadija, encouraged Muhammad’s fanatical conviction of the truth of his “god-given” teachings. He rejected the old pagan beliefs and preached about a single all-powerful god. The doctrine of strict monotheism, the universality of the new faith, which proclaimed the equality of all its followers irrespective of social origin or clan membership, and Muhammad’s exceptional political and organizational abilities—all found a favorable response among those representatives of Meccan society, primarily from the middle strata, who sought to unite and strengthen Arabia.\nInitially the Meccan merchant oligarchy opposed his teachings, and Muhammad and his followers were forced to take refuge in Yathrib, later called Medina. The day of their flight, usually considered to be Sept. 22, 622, is called the Hegira. In 630 and 631 the Muslims, led by Muhammad, subjugated Mecca and subsequently a large number of other regions in Arabia. Muhammad, who was both a religious and political leader, became the head of a new Islamic theocratic state. His tomb in Medina has become the second most important Islamic shrine and place of pilgrimage after the Kabba in Mecca.\nM. A. B\nATUNSKII\nThe Dome of the Rock is, according to Islamic tradition, where the Prophet Muhammed was taken to Jerusalem by the angel Gabriel in his “Night Journey” dream.\nMuhammad\n(dreams)\nAccording to tradition, Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, was born in 570 C.E., the same year Mecca was attacked by the army of Abrahah, ruler of Yemen. At the age of forty, during the holy month of Ramadan while he was sleeping in a mountaintop cave between the hills of Safa and Meeva, near Mecca, he received the first revelation of the Qur’an. By that time, he had already experienced visions of isolated luminous and sonorous impressions that he described as “the breaking of the light of dawn.” He himself was never able to translate some of those images, which appear as isolated letters placed at the beginning of several parts of the Qur’an.\nIn the “Lailatal-Miraj” or (“Night Journey”), the dream in which Muhammad’s religious mission as well as portions of the Qur’an were revealed, the angel Gabriel appeared to him, leading Elboraq, a half-human silver mare. Riding Elboraq, and led by Gabriel, Muhammad traveled to Jerusalem in an instant, and there he conversed and prayed with Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Continuing on his journey, he traversed the seven celestial spheres. Each sphere is infused with its own color, the esoteric meanings of which relate to the seven levels of existence: material, vegetable, animal, human, and three more beyond ordinary human nature. Then he reached across the ocean of white light, and, finally, he approached God. According to some versions of the story, Muhammad also descended to the depths of the earth.\nBelief in the inspiration given to Muhammad by the angel Gabriel during this dream is a fundamental element of Islam. According to Muhammad, he is the last prophet placed at the end of a long line of precursors, who had been inspired in the same way. Their inspiration, to which Islamic theology gives the name revelation, was destined to be made public, and such inspiration ceased after Muhammad’s death.\nMuhammad showed considerable concern for dreams, and it is said that each morning after prayers he asked his assembled followers what they had dreamed, interpreted the most significant dreams, and reported his own. By doing this, he believed he could glean from the dreams any messages from God.\nThe principles of dream interpretation that Muhammad used were common to those of other Near Eastern religions, and much importance was given to truthful telling of dreams, which was best done immediately on waking, as well as to the quality of the dream interpreter. According to Muhammad, a dream is a conversation between humanity and God.\nMuhammad"

                "The Ipcress File is a 1965 British espionage film directed by Sidney J. Furie, starring Michael Caine and featuring Guy Doleman and Nigel Green. The screenplay by Bill Canaway and James Doran was based on Len Deighton's novel, The IPCRESS File (1962). It has won critical acclaim and a BAFTA award for best British film. In 1999 it was included at number 59 on the BFI list of the 100 best British films of the 20th century.\n\nPlot\n\nA top scientist called Radcliffe is kidnapped and his security escort killed. Harry Palmer, a British Army sergeant with a criminal past now working for a Ministry of Defence organisation, is summoned by his boss, Colonel Ross, and told that he is being transferred to a section of the organisation headed by Major Dalby.\n\nRoss suspects that Radcliffe's disappearance is part of a deliberate plot: sixteen top British scientists have inexplicably ceased to function, leaving their jobs at the peak of their careers. He threatens Dalby that his organisation will go if it can't get Radcliffe back. Palmer is then introduced as a replacement for the dead security escort.\n\nAt his first departmental meeting, Palmer befriends Jock Carswell. Dalby briefs his agents, saying that they suspect Eric Ashley Grantby, codenamed \"Bluejay\", and his chief of staff, codenamed \"Housemartin\". Using a Scotland Yard contact, Palmer locates Grantby, who gives him a contact number. It doesn't work when Palmer rings it, and when he tries to stop Grantby, Housemartin attacks him and the two get away.\n\nLater, Carswell and Palmer learn that Housemartin has been arrested, but by the time they reach the police station, they find that men impersonating them have killed him. Suspecting that Radcliffe may be being held in a disused factory near where Housemartin was picked up, Palmer orders a search, but they find only a piece of audiotape marked 'IPCRESS' that produces a meaningless noise when played.\n\nDalby then shows Palmer that the paper on which Grantby wrote the phone number is in fact the programme for an upcoming military band concert in a park. There they encounter Grantby and a deal is struck for Radcliffe's return. The exchange goes as planned, but as they are leaving, Palmer sees a man in the shadows and shoots him. It turns out to be a CIA agent who has also been following Grantby. Palmer is subsequently followed by another CIA operative, who threatens to kill him if he discovers that the death was not a mistake.\n\nSome days later, it becomes clear that while Radcliffe is physically unharmed, his mind has been affected and he can no longer function as a scientist. Carswell discovers a book titled \"Induction of Psychoneuroses by Conditioned Reflex under Stress\": IPCRESS, which he believes explains what has happened to Radcliffe and the other scientists. Carswell borrows Palmer's car to test his theory on Radcliffe, but is killed before reaching him.\n\nBelieving that he himself must have been the intended target, Palmer goes home to collect his belongings and there discovers the body of the second CIA agent. When he returns to the office, the IPCRESS file is missing from his desk. Certain that he is being set up, Palmer tells Dalby what has happened and that he suspects Ross took the file, revealing that Ross had previously asked him to microfilm it. Dalby tells him to leave town for a while.\n\nOn the train to Paris, Palmer is kidnapped and wakes up imprisoned in a cell. After several days during which Palmer is denied sleep, food and warmth, Grantby reveals himself as his kidnapper and tells him that he has been taken to Albania. Having read the file, Palmer realises that their treatment of him is part of the conditioning for the brainwashing procedures to come. During it, he uses pain to distract himself but after many sessions inducing stress through electronic sounds and disorientating images, he succumbs. Grantby then instills a trigger phrase that will make Palmer follow any commands given to him.\n\nPalmer eventually manages to escape and, on reaching the street, realises he is still in London. He phones Dalby, who is in Grantby’s company at the time. Dalby uses the trigger phrase and gets Palmer to call Ross to the warehouse. As Dalby and Ross arrive, Palmer holds them at gunpoint. Dalby accuses Ross of killing Carswell; Ross tells Palmer that he had been investigating Dalby, whom he already suspected. Dalby uses the trigger phrase again and commands him to ‘Kill the traitor now’. At this point, Palmer strikes his wavering hand against a piece of metal and the pain reminds him of his conditioning. Dalby goes for his gun and Palmer shoots him. When Palmer reproaches Ross for endangering him in that way, he is told that it is part of his job.\n\nMain cast\n\n*Michael Caine as Harry Palmer\n*Guy Doleman as Colonel Ross\n*Nigel Green as Major Dalby\n*Sue Lloyd as Jean Courtney\n*Gordon Jackson as Carswell\n*Aubrey Richards as Dr. Radcliffe\n*Frank Gatliff as Bluejay\n*Thomas Baptiste as Barney\n*Oliver MacGreevy as Housemartin\n*Freda Bamford as Alice\n*Pauline Winter as Charlady\n*Anthony Blackshaw as Edwards\n*Barry Raymond as Gray\n*David Glover as Chilcott-Oakes\n*Stanley Meadows as Inspector Keightley\n*Peter Ashmore as Sir Robert \n*Michael Murray as Raid Inspector\n*Anthony Baird as Raid Sergeant \n*Tony Caunter as O.N.I. man\n*Douglas Blackwell as Murray\n*Glynn Edwards as Police Station Sergeant\n\nProduction and contrast with Bond franchise\n\nThe film was intended as an ironically downbeat alternative portrait of the world of spies portrayed in the successful and popular James Bond films, even though one of the producers and others in the production team were also responsible for the Bond franchise. In contrast to Bond's public school background and playboy lifestyle, Palmer is a cockney who lives in a Notting Hill flat and has to put up with red tape and inter-departmental rivalries. When appointed to a new post, he immediately asks whether he will get a pay rise (by contrast, Bond's salary is hardly mentioned and he only goes to the best hotels, often using the presidential suite). The action is set entirely in \"a gritty, gloomy, decidedly non-swinging\" London with humdrum locations.  And although Palmer is, like Bond, a gourmet, he shops in a supermarket.\n\nIn this respect, it is a tribute to the complexity and flexibility of the mind of Harry Saltzman, who was an acknowledged master of proposing \"bigger and more extravagant ideas\" for Bond films according to the MGM Home Entertainment documentary Harry Saltzman: Showman.  Five prominent members of the production team – producer Harry Saltzman, executive producer Charles Kasher (who also produced the sequel Funeral In Berlin),  film editor Peter R. Hunt, composer John Barry and production designer Ken Adam – also worked on the James Bond film series, and projects like this ultimately led to Saltzman's departure from Eon Productions and his sale of Danjaq, LLC to United Artists in 1975.\n\nHarry Saltzman gave Jimmy Sangster a copy of the novel to read. Sangster enjoyed the book and was eager to adapt the novel, and suggested Michael Caine play the role and Sidney J. Furie direct. However, Saltzman would not commit to the timeframe that Sangster insisted upon.  Ken Hughes wrote a script which Saltzman rejected. \n\nIpcress had two immediate sequels: Funeral in Berlin (1966) and Billion Dollar Brain (1967). Decades later Michael Caine returned to his Harry Palmer character in Harry Alan Towers's Bullet to Beijing (1995) and Midnight in Saint Petersburg (1996).\n\nThe film was shot in Techniscope, an economical 2 perf (each frame taking up only two perforations of film length rather than four or more) widescreen format introduced by Technicolor Italia in 1963. Techniscope allowed a greater depth of field because it was shot with shorter focal length lenses than the anamorphic widescreen processes. This allowed cinematographer Otto Heller to construct images in deep focus, shooting behind objects and allowing both the objects in the foreground and the action taking place in the background to be in focus. \n\nThe complex electronic sound effect of the brain-washing process was conceived by sound engineer Norman Wanstall and created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. \n\nHarry Palmer character\n\nThe protagonist of Deighton's novel was nameless, but in Chapter 5 he remarks, \"My name isn't Harry, but in this business it's hard to remember whether it ever had been.\" In the opening scenes of the film, Palmer is shown to care little for authority, to indulge in quick repartee and to have an interest in good food. Newspaper cuttings shown in Palmer's kitchen are actually cookery articles written for The Observer by Deighton, an accomplished cook and cookery writer.[http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/d/len-deighton/action-cook-book.htm Action Cook Book by Len Deighton][http://www.amazon.com/Cookstrip-cook-book-Len-Deighton/dp/B0007ELS8M Amazon.com: Cookstrip cook book: Books: Len Deighton] In a scene where Palmer prepares a meal, the hands in close-up are Deighton's.\n\nReception\n\nWhen the film premiered at the Leicester Square Theatre in London on 18 March 1965, the film critic for The Times had mixed feelings about it. While enjoying the first part of the film, and generally praising Michael Caine, the critic found the second half bewildering to the extent that the characters \"cease to be pleasantly mystifying and become just irritatingly obscure.\"\n\nThe film is included on the British Film Institute's BFI 100, a list of 100 of the best British films of the 20th century, at No. 59,  and currently holds a \"Fresh\" rating of 100% at Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nAwards\n\nThe film won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film, and Ken Adam won the award for 'Best British Art Direction, Colour'.[http://www.filmdesigners.co.uk/help.php?section=awards The British Film Designers Guild :: Helpful Information]\n\nScreenwriters Bill Canaway and James Doran received a 1966 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Foreign Film Screenplay.\n\nThe film was entered into the 1965 Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for the Palme d'Or award.",
                "The IPCRESS File is Len Deighton's first spy novel, published in 1962. It was made into a film in 1965 produced by Harry Saltzman, directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Michael Caine. The novel, which involves Cold War brainwashing, includes scenes in Lebanon and on an atoll for a United States atomic weapon test, as well as information about Joe One, the Soviet Union's first atomic bomb, although these elements did not appear in the film version.\n\nPlot\n\nThe novel is framed as the unnamed protagonist delivering his personal report on \"the IPCRESS affair\" directly to the Minister of Defence, thus making the novel itself the 'IPCRESS File' of the title. The events begin soon after his transfer from military intelligence to WOOC(P), a small civilian intelligence agency reporting directly to the British Cabinet under a man named Dalby. An intelligence broker code-named \"Jay\" is suspected to be behind a series of kidnappings of highly-placed and influential British VIPs with the intention of selling them to the Soviets, and the protagonist is assigned to meet with Jay in order to secure the release of \"Raven\", a high-ranking scientist and his latest target. After meeting Jay at a sleazy Soho strip club to negotiate Raven's release, the protagonist is abandoned; investigating his surroundings, he discovers Raven's unconscious body in a back room and attempts to rescue him, but is unsuccessful.\n\nWOOC(P) receives intelligence that Raven is to be transferred to the Soviets in Beirut, and a rescue mission is organised with Dalby and the protagonist participating. The protagonist is assigned as a lookout while Dalby kills Raven's captors and rescues him. The protagonist is forced to kill the occupants of a car which suddenly arrives on the scene in order to maintain the cover of the operation, believing them to be operatives working for Jay; they instead turn out to be members of ONI. The operation is otherwise a success and Raven is recovered, but the investigation into Jay continues. Dalby disappears, apparently going undercover, leaving the protagonist temporarily in charge of WOOC(P). At this point the protagonist's former superior from military intelligence, Colonel Ross, approaches the protagonist offering to sell him confidential information related to the affair. The protagonist rejects the offer in disgust, but begins to second-guess himself.\n\nCarswell, a statistician from another department assigned to the matter, begins noting a range of bizarre and seemingly irrelevant links between many of the kidnap victims. A break suddenly appears when Housemartin, one of Jay's high-ranking operatives, is arrested in Shoreditch for impersonating a police officer, but by the time the protagonist and Murray, another operative assigned to the case, arrive at the police station only to discover he has been murdered in his cell. Information from the arrest enables WOOC(P) and the police to storm one of Jay's safe-houses, but it has been abandoned. In order to help with the administration of the department, the protagonist is assigned an assistant, Jean, a beautiful young woman he begins to develop romantic feelings towards.Dalby re-emerges, and reveals intelligence suggesting that Jay's operations will interfere with an American neutron bomb test in the Pacific.\n\nDalby, Jean and the protagonist are sent to the test site as British observers, and while there the protagonist learns from an old friend, Barney, that the Americans suspect him of being a double-agent due to the deaths of the CIA operatives in Beirut. Jean reveals to the protagonist that Dalby has left been visiting an abandoned Japanese bunker on the island. Soon after, Barney is killed in apparently suspicious circumstances, and while following Dalby to the scene the protagonist is present when the bomb test site is sabotaged, setting back the bomb test and killing a military police officer. The protagonist is arrested by the Americans and interrogated, before apparently being transferred to Hungary on suspicion of being a Soviet agent. There, he is drugged and subject to days of psychological and physical torture, and nearly cracks before eventually managing to escape -- only to discover that he is in fact back in London. The protagonist takes refuge with Charlie Cavendish, the father of a friend killed towards the end of the Second World War, and attempts to reestablish contact with WOOC(P) without being arrested for treason. Charlie is killed by Jay's operatives, forcing the protagonist on the run; he approaches Dalby at his home, but discovers Dalby meeting with Murray, Jay and another of Jay's operatives -- confirming the protagonist's suspicions that Dalby is in fact the traitor. \n\nThe protagonist is discovered by Murray, who reveals himself to be an undercover operative from military intelligence also investigating Dalby. The protagonist escapes, but is soon captured by Jay's operatives and taken to meet Jay -- he has, however, allowed military intelligence to follow them, and Jay and Dalby are arrested by Colonel Ross. The protagonist reveals to Jean that Jay and Dalby were using a process called \"Induction of Psycho-neuroses by Conditioned Reflex with Stress\" (IPCRESS) to brainwash the VIPs into loyalty to the Soviet Union, which they had also unsuccessfully attempted to subject the protagonist to. The seemingly irrelevant links that Carswell had discovered were in fact indicators of the personality traits that Jay had used to determine which VIPs would easily succumb to the process. Dalby was the one who had sabotaged the American bomb test, as part of Jay and Dalby's efforts to frame the protagonist. Colonel Ross reveals that his attempt to sell information to the protagonist had been a test of his loyalty, which the protagonist had passed by rejecting it. The novel ends with the protagonist concluding his report to the Minister, revealing that Jay has turned and began working for the British, while Dalby has been executed and his death covered up as a car accident.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1992 Deighton said that the inspiration to write the novel came from his real-life neighbour Anna Wolkoff, a White Russian émigré who collaborated with a cipher clerk from the American embassy to spy for Germany in World War II. Deighton's mother cooked for Wolkoff's dinner parties and he said that he \"vividly\" remembered when British MI5 agents came to arrest her: \"The experience was a major factor in my decision to write a spy story at my first attempt at fiction.\"  The plot involves mind control, the acronym IPCRESS of the title standing for \"Induction of Psycho-neuroses by Conditioned Reflex under Stress\". The brainwashing is similar to a shock technique called psychic driving pioneered by Donald Ewen Cameron in the 1950s, originally on unwitting mental hospital patients, which was utilised and funded by the Central Intelligence Agency's secret MKULTRA program in Canada.\n\nNovel\n\nDeighton's protagonist is nameless; this is maintained through all the sequels (although later in the series called \"Charles\").  Early in the novel we learn that he worked for Military Intelligence for three years before joining his present agency – WOOC(P) – as a civilian employee. WOOC(P) is described as \"one of the smallest and most important of the Intelligence Units\". (It is never stated exactly what the initials stand for, although his previous boss refers to it as Provisional.) We also learn in passing that he is from Burnley, Lancashire, and that he was born in 1922 or 1923. \n\nWOOC(P) is a small department and the nameless hero has a great deal of autonomy.  He is also quite paranoid, keeping an \"escape package\" containing money, a false passport and other documents circulating in the mail.  Once a week he picks up the package from an accommodation address, a seedy London shop, and re-mails it to that address in a fresh envelope. He is also a gourmet who enjoys good food. Cooking features frequently in both the film and the novel; Deighton himself was an accomplished cook.\n\nIn common with several of his other early novels, the chapter headings have a \"feature\". In The IPCRESS File these take the form of each chapter being headed with a quote from a horoscope, which relates to the action in the chapter, though vaguely, as in most horoscopes.\n\nThe front cover, by Deighton's friend Raymond Hawkey, has been described as \"the template for the covers of all subsequent airport novels\". \n\nFilm\n\nA film adaptation starring Michael Caine was released in 1965 and produced by the James Bond co-producer Harry Saltzman, assisted by several prominent members of the Bond production family. The film medium made it difficult to maintain the anonymity of Deighton's hero, who acquired the name Harry Palmer.\n\nThe character's name was chosen by Caine, who was having lunch with Harry Saltzman. Saltzman invited Caine over to his table for coffee. They were trying to think of a name for the protagonist, and agreed that a boring name would best suit the protagonist's persona. Caine suggested the name Harry and then immediately apologised to Saltzman. Luckily Saltzman saw the funny side and pointed out that his real first name was actually Herschel, not Harry, so Saltzman was satisfied with it. The inspiration for the surname came from a boy called Palmer whom Caine knew at school. Caine described Palmer as: \"the most boring boy I'd ever met\". \n\nThe given name \"Harry\" actually occurs in a short sequence in the book where the nameless hero is greeted by someone saying \"Hello, Harry.\" This causes him to think, \"Now my name isn't Harry, but in this business it's hard to remember whether it ever had been.\" \n\nNotes"

                "Helium Facts - Atom, Properties, Uses, Gas, Balloons, Voice, Element He\nHelium Facts\nCheck out these great helium facts relating to  its discovery, uses and chemical properties.\nLearn about helium balloons, noble  gases, the helium atom, the balloon boy hoax, space related helium storage  tanks, how helium can change a person’s voice and much more with our range of  interesting helium facts, properties and information.\n \nHelium is a chemical element with the symbol He  and atomic number 2.\nHelium is a colorless, tasteless and odorless  gas.\nHelium is the second most common element in the  Universe (after hydrogen), making up around 24% of its mass.\nHelium is part of a group of chemical elements  called noble gases, the other five that occur naturally are neon, argon,  krypton, xenon and radon. Under normal conditions they share similar  properties, including being less likely to participate in chemical reactions  due to their outer shell of electrons being full. Helium is the second least  reactive element after neon.\nFrench and English astronomers Pierre Janssen  and Norman Lockyer are jointly credited with discovering helium after spectral  analysis of sunlight following a solar eclipse in 1868.\nThe word helium comes from the Greek word  meaning sun (helios). It was named by Lockyer and English chemist Edward  Frankland.\nThe USA is the world’s  largest supplier of helium, with many reserves found in large natural gas  fields.\nThe rate at which helium is currently being used  by humans is much faster than the rate at which the reserves are being replenished.  New technologies for obtaining or recycling helium are one way for gas  companies to help slow this problem.\nBecause helium is lighter than air it is  commonly used to fill airships, blimps and balloons. As it doesn’t burn or  react with other chemicals, helium is relatively safe to use for this purpose.\nWhile hydrogen is 7% more buoyant than helium it  has a much higher fire risk.\nYou might notice the helium balloon you got from  the amusement park slowly falling to the ground after a few days, this happens  as the helium gradually leaks from the balloon.\nHelium has a lifting force of around one gram  per liter. A balloon that holds 10 liters of helium should therefore lift an  object weighing 10 grams. Unfortunately you’ll need around 5000 of these balloons  if you weigh around 50kgs and want to get off the ground.\nThe balloon boy hoax from October 15, 2009 led people to believe that a six year old boy had floated away in a  home made helium balloon when in fact he was hiding at his house the whole time.\nBecause helium is less dense than normal air,  when inhaled from a source such as a helium balloon it briefly changes the  sound of a person’s voice, making it much sound much higher. However, breathing  in too much helium can be very dangerous, potentially choking people due to a  lack of oxygen.\nHelium can be in a liquid and even solid state  but they can only occur at temperatures near absolute zero.\nLiquid helium is used to cool metals for superconductivity  use. The European Organization for Nuclear Research’s (CERN) Large Hadron  Collider uses liquid helium to maintain an extremely low temperature.\nHelium is often used in space programs, displacing  fuel in storage tanks and having other rocket fuel applications.",
                "Why Does Inhaling Helium Make Your Voice Sound Funny? | Mental Floss\nWhy Does Inhaling Helium Make Your Voice Sound Funny?\nThinkStock\nLike us on Facebook\nHelium's atomic number is 2 and its atomic weight is 4.002602. Its boiling and melting points— -452.1°F and -458.0°F, respectively—are the lowest among the elements. It is the second most abundant element in the known universe (after hydrogen). And it makes your voice sound really funny when you inhale it. Here's why.\nA Crash Course in Sound\nWhen you speak, air travels up from your lungs and through the larynx, where it meets the vocal cords (or vocal folds), twin infoldings of mucous membrane stretched horizontally across the larynx, and hits the underside, causing them to vibrate. The vibration of the cords excites air molecules in your vocal tract and sets up resonant frequencies. The vibration of the vocal cords influences the pitch (the perceived fundamental frequency of a sound) of your voice; the vibration of the air in the vocal tract influences your voice's timbre (the quality of a sound that distinguishes different types of sound production—remember that for later, it will be important); and manipulation of the vocal tract—moving your tongue, lips, etc.—creates different resonant frequencies and allows you to make the different sounds of speech, like \"oohs\" and \"aahs.\" Your voice finally leaves your mouth in the form of waves, oscillations of pressure transmitted through a medium.\nVoice, Meet Helium\nIn addition to the vibrations and manipulations that influence the sound of your voice, what another person hears when you speak also depends in part on what the space where the sound is created contains. The air that fills a room where you might be speaking to someone is made up of roughly 78.08 percent nitrogen, 20.95 percent oxygen, 0.93 percent argon, 0.038 percent carbon dioxide, and tiny amounts of other gases. Nitrogen, which makes up the majority of our air, has a mass roughly seven times greater than that of helium. Because helium is lighter than air, sound waves travel through it faster. In a room where the temperature is 68 degrees Fahrenheit, sound travels at 344 meters a second through air, but 927 meters a second through helium. When you inhale helium, you're changing the type of gas molecules in your vocal tract and increasing the speed of the sound of your voice.\nSome people think that helium changes the pitch of your voice, but the vibration frequency of the vocal cords doesn't change along with the type of gas molecules that surround them. When your vocal tract is filled with helium, your vocal cords are vibrating at the same frequency as usual. It's actually the timbre (again, the quality of a sound that distinguishes different types of sound, also known as tone quality or tone color) that changes, because those lighter-than-air helium molecules allow sound to travel faster and change the resonances of your vocal tract by making it more responsive to high-frequency sounds and less responsive to lower ones. Your voice winds up flat and Donald Duck-esque and listeners perceive this as a change in pitch.\nMore Fun With Gases\nIf a lighter gas like helium gives us a squeaky-sounding voice, you might to assume that a heavier-than-air gas would amplify the lower resonant frequencies and make it deeper and richer (trading Donald Duck for Barry White, if you will). You'd be correct; gases like xenon and sulfur hexafluoride slow the speed of sound and lower the resonant frequencies of your vocal tract. \nNo Fun With Gas\nAs amusing as the results are, inhaling helium is not so great for you. While you're inhaling it, you're not getting the oxygen you need for normal respiration. Breathing helium continuously can cause asphyxiation within a few minutes. That light-headed feeling you get from a few inhalations is a sign you need to take a break. And please don't ever inhale helium directly from one of those pressurized tanks. The high flow rate can rupture your lung tissue or send a concentrated mass of gas into your bloodstream, after which it can lodge in the brain and cause a stroke, seizures and death.\nThis story originally appeared in 2009.",
                "How Helium Works | Squeaky Voice | Effects & Dangers of Inhaling\nHate\n6\nI'm sure most of us have sucked back a quick inhale from a helium balloon and had a good laugh. Sounding like Donald Duck or the Chipmunks is enough to make anyone crack up. What is it about helium that makes us sound so funny?\nNo one will disagree that helium changes your voice, but not everyone believes it is helium that causes your voice to become high-pitched. What it does is change the timbre of your voice. This has nothing to do with falling trees. Timbre is what allows you to tell the difference between the same note played at the same volume on two different instruments. It also helps you hear the different parts of speech, like vowel sounds.\nYou need to know how sound works to understand what happens. When you talk, air travels from your lungs up through the larynx and out of your mouth. The larynx has a pair of vocal folds which form a V-shaped slit. When the air is leaving, it hits the underside of the vocal folds and makes them vibrate. Are you still with me? This vibrating excites air molecules in your vocal tract. By moving your tongue, lips, roof of your mouth, etc. you can create recognizable sounds. So that's how sound works. Let's get back to helium.\nHelium is much lighter than air. Because of this, the speed of sound is much higher in helium. When you inhale helium you increase the speed of the sound of your voice. The shape of your vocal tract doesn't change. If you increase the speed of a sound you also increase the wavelength. However, on the way to the ear the sound travels thru air again and the wavelength goes back to normal. It's not the change in frequency that gives you the squeaky voice but a change in pitch. The sound has the same frequencies but helium causes a shift in your timbre. This means the higher frequencies are getting a higher enhancement than normal so the pitch changes. The end result? You sound like a chipmunk.\nAlthough inhaling helium is fun it's not exactly healthy. Every time you inhale pure helium, you are not inhaling oxygen. Whatever you do, never inhale helium from a high pressure tank! Besides the serious risk of lung damage, you could end up with bubbles of helium in the arteries that lead to your brain. This can lead to stroke-like symptoms and, of course, death. Still laughing? Didn't think so.\nRelated Stories:",
                "Why does inhaling helium make your voice go high-pitched? | Notes and Queries | guardian.co.uk\nWhy does inhaling helium make your voice go high-pitched?\nJim Champion, Birmingham, UK\nLower density, compared to air.\nJohn, Kettering\nThe sounds you produce originate in various \"resonators\" in your vocal tract. It is a bit like a very complicated musical instrument under your control. The frequency a resonator produces depends on its size (which is partly why children have higher voices, and picolos produce higher notes than bassoons) and on the speed of sound in the gas it contains. The speed of sound in helium is nearly three times higher than that in air, which makes the sound waves shorter in length, and increases the frequencies the resonators produce.\nDivers use mixtures containing helium (heliox and trimix) to dive to depths much over 50 metres, and electronic convertors are needed to convert their squeaky speech into something comprehensible.\nAs a postgraduate student, I very ill advisedly tried breathing the heavy, rather inert gas sulphur hexafluoride whose speed of sound is nearly three times slower than in air. It had the opposite effect, and I become an instant basso profundo; I survived, and a few breaths later my voice returned to normal, but as they say, please don't try this at home!\"\nProf Harvey Rutt, Southampton, UK\nSound travels faster in helium than it does in ordinary air. (heluim atoms are less massive than oxygen or nitrogen molecules and so for a given amount of heat energy available (temperature) they will fly about quicker and carry a disturbance more rapidly ie sound).\nIn a sound wave the product of wavelength and frequency is a constant and is equal to the sound speed. I'm afraid this isn't a very rigorous answer but, using this relationship, we know the local sound speed is increased and given that the wavelengths of the noises produced are more or less unchanged (presumably since the dominant wavelengths produced in speech depend mainly on the geometry and the dimensions of the throat during a particular articulation) the frequency or pitch will therefore rise.\nOn a tangent to this, natural changes in the composition of air as it is exhaled, due to increased carbon dioxide (lower sound speed than oxygen and nitrogen) and reduced oxygen, should result in a perceptable downward shift in frequency. This might be noticeable for example when blowing a very long note with a woodwind instrument - that is, if it isn't sub-consciously corrected for. I've never tried it myself.\nR Telling, Weymouth Dorset\nHelium is much less dense than air, so our vocal cords encounter far less resistance in this medium, making the vibrations much more frequent.\nPeadar Mac Con Aonaigh, Brixton, London, UK\nThe above answer is incorrect. Lower resistence to vibration will LOWER the frequency of vibration (think of loosening a guitar string, or plucking a loose rubberband). ....... The speed of sound travelling through Helium is faster than that in air. For a pressure disturbance to create a pitch, it must vary at a frequency that resonates in our vocal tract. When the speed of sound in increased, the pressure wave reaches the end of our vocal tract before it has completed a full cycle, so it doesn't resonate. Faster vibrations of our vocal cords produce pressure disturbances which ARE able to resonate in our vocal tract, so it is these higher pitches that we hear. ...... A related effect is heard by playing a violin in Helium. The lowest notes have a wavelength that doesn't fit within the violin body, so they don't sound! (the length of a wave on the violin STRING is longer than the wavelength in the body because the speed of sound in a solid is faster than that in a gas)\nXaq, Doylestown USA\nYour analogies used as refutation of the answer proceeding yours are not relevent. You compared the tension of the vibrating object with the resistance of the medium in which the object is vibrating. Not necessarily equivalent.\nHowever, thanks for the best explanation I've found on the Internet of why Helium changes the formant of the voice but not necessarily the pitch. Cheers!\nMatthew Tatus, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA\nwell people of the earth (i like starting a speach like that) i have an answer to all your questions about helium well i got news for you i have now idea what it is to do for us in this world i mean really come on who wakes up and say \"hey i smell the freash helium.\" how many people do that you want to know none thats how many none i just had to share my fellings so dont get mad carry on with your lives thank you\nalvin yocatory, sadiego usa\nIt's because it has less density than air\nDonna Cull, London, England\nHelium is significantly less dense than air. As a result, the speed of sound is much higher in helium. By inhaling helium you are effectively increasing the speed of the sound of your voice.\nDonna Cull, London, England",
                "The Straight Dope: Why does helium make your voice squeaky?\nA Staff Report from the Straight Dope Science Advisory Board\nWhy does helium make your voice squeaky?\nJuly 14, 2000\nWhy does inhaling helium make your voice sound funny and high pitched?\n— Ian, Nowheresville\nSDStaff Alphagene replies:\nThis takes me back to the days when I would spend hour after hour at birthday parties and bar mitzvahs sucking helium out of dozens of balloons to the amusement of myself and my fellow junior high schoolers.\nCut me some slack, I hadn't discovered booze yet.\nAnyway, Ian, let's talk acoustics. While no one will question that helium makes your voice sound funny, people who are knowledgeable about acoustics will insist that helium does not make your voice high-pitched. That bears repeating: helium does not change the pitch of your voice. Don't believe me? There's a web site that has sound files demonstrating this fact rather well. It's educational and you get to hear a man with an Australian accent sing a monotonous song with a vocal tract full of helium. Check out http://www. phys.unsw.edu.au/PHYSICS_!/SPEECH_HELIUM/speech.html . The fourth sound file is bound to be a Top 40 hit.\nWhat helium does change is the timbre of your voice. Timbre is what allows you to distinguish between the same note played at the same volume on two different instruments. Timbre also allows you to distinguish different elements of speech (such as vowel sounds) from each other. For this last reason, timbre is very important to interpreting speech.\nWhen you speak, air travels from your lungs up through the larynx on its way out of your mouth. In the larynx are a pair of vocal folds which meet to form a V-shaped slit. On its way through, the air hits the underside of your vocal folds causing them to vibrate. This vibration then excites air molecules in your vocal tract, setting up resonant frequencies that are interpreted by the ear. By manipulating your vocal tract (moving your tongue, lips, soft palate, etc.) you can create different resonant frequencies allowing you to make the many different sounds of coherent speech.\nEveryday speech is a combination of the vibration of your vocal folds (which influences the pitch) and the vibration of the air in your vocal tract (which influences the timbre). When you say \"ee,\" your tongue, lips, etc., are in a different configuration than when you say \"ooh.\" Each speech element has a specific pattern of frequencies, like a fingerprint. The resonant frequencies that make the \"ee\" sound are distinct from those that produce \"ooh\". These distinct patterns allow us to recognize an \"ee\" sound regardless of pitch — a soprano singing \"ee\" produces the same resonant frequencies as a baritone singing \"ee.\"\nHelium is significantly less dense than air. As a result, the speed of sound is much higher in helium. By inhaling helium you are effectively increasing the speed of the sound of your voice. The configuration of your vocal tract does not change, however. If you increase the speed of a sound while keeping its wavelength constant, you increase the frequency of that sound. (Think of it as a sort of Doppler effect.) Since each element of speech is composed of a pattern of several frequencies, altering the speed of sound distorts that pattern. Result: you sound like Donald Duck.\nNote that the pitch remains the same because your vocal folds are vibrating at the same frequency as when you were breathing air. Contrary to many explanations I have read, helium does not significantly affect the vibration of your vocal folds. To repeat yet again, helium drastically changes the timbre of your voice without having any significant effect on its pitch.\nI have heard reports of wacky chemistry professors (how's that for redundant?) inhaling balloons full of xenon gas. Because pure xenon is much denser than air, the speed of sound through xenon is slower, and inhaling xenon lowers the resonant frequencies of your vocal tract. Some web sites recommend wearing a cowboy hat while speaking in a \"xenon voice\" for maximum comedic effect. Yee ha.\nOne final note: inhaling helium is not a terribly healthy thing to do. Every time you inhale pure helium, you are not inhaling oxygen. And for the love of Pierre-Jules-César Janssen (the first man to find evidence for the existence of helium), do not inhale helium from a pressurized tank! In addition to risking serious damage to your lungs, you could wind up with helium bubbles in the arteries that supply blood to your brain. This is known as a cerebral arterial gas embolism and can lead to stroke-like symptoms including, of course, death.\nSo unless you want to spend the next few days after your friend's bar mitzvah in a hyperbaric chamber, take it easy on the helium balloons, OK?\n— SDStaff Alphagene, Straight Dope Science Advisory Board\nStaff Reports are written by the Straight Dope Science Advisory Board, Cecil's online auxiliary.

                "Linda Thorson (born Linda Robinson on 18 June 1947) is a Canadian actress, best known for playing Tara King in The Avengers  (1968–69). For her role in The Avengers, Thorson received a special BAFTA at the 2000 BAFTA TV Awards along with the other three actresses from the series, Honor Blackman, Joanna Lumley and Diana Rigg.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,  she attended Bishop Strachan School,  and then moved to the UK in 1965 to study acting. She graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art with an Honours Diploma on 1 July 1967.

                "The Avengers is a spy-fi British television series created in 1961. The Avengers initially focused on Dr. David Keel (Ian Hendry) and his assistant John Steed (Patrick Macnee). Hendry left after the first series and Steed became the main character, partnered with a succession of assistants. Steed's most famous assistants were intelligent, stylish and assertive women: Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), Emma Peel (Diana Rigg), and Tara King (Linda Thorson). Later episodes increasingly incorporated elements of science fiction and fantasy, parody and British eccentricity. The Avengers ran from 1961 until 1969, screening as one-hour episodes its entire run.\n\nThe pilot episode, \"Hot Snow,\" aired on 7 January 1961. The final episode, \"Bizarre,\" aired on 21 May 1969.\n\nThe Avengers was produced by Associated British Corporation, a contractor within the ITV network. After a merger in July 1968 ABC Television became Thames Television, which continued production of the series although it was still broadcast under the ABC name. By 1969 The Avengers was shown in more than 90 countries. ITV produced a sequel series The New Avengers (1976–1977) with Patrick Macnee returning as John Steed, and two new partners.\n\nIn 2007 The Avengers was ranked #20 on TV Guides Top Cult Shows Ever. \n\nProgramme premise and overview\n\nThe Avengers was marked by different eras as co-stars came and went. The only constant was John Steed, played by Patrick Macnee.\n\n1961: With Dr David Keel (Ian Hendry)\n\nThe Avengers followed Police Surgeon, in which Ian Hendry played police surgeon Geoffrey Brent.  While Police Surgeon did not last long, viewers praised Hendry.\n\nThe Avengers began with episode \"Hot Snow\", in which medical doctor Dr David Keel (Hendry) investigates the murder of his fiancée and office receptionist Peggy by a drug ring. A stranger named John Steed, who was investigating the ring, appeared and together they set out to avenge her death in the first two episodes. Afterwards, Steed asked Keel to partner him as needed to solve crimes. Hendry was considered the star of the new series, receiving top billing over Macnee, and Steed did not appear in two episodes.\n\nAs the first series of The Avengers progressed, Steed's importance increased, and he carried the final episode solo. While Steed and Keel used wit while discussing crimes and dangers, the series also depicted the interplay—and often tension—between Keel's idealism and Steed's professionalism. As seen in one of the two surviving episodes from the first series, \"The Frighteners\", Steed also had helpers among the population who provided information, similar to the \"Baker Street Irregulars\" of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThe other regular in the first series was Carol Wilson (Ingrid Hafner), the nurse and receptionist who replaced the slain Peggy. Carol assisted Keel and Steed in cases, without being part of Steed's inner circle. Hafner had played opposite Hendry as a nurse in Police Surgeon.\n\nThe series was shot on 405-line videotape using a multicamera setup. There was little provision for editing and virtually no location footage (although the very first shot of the first episode consisted of location footage). As was standard practice at the time, videotapes of early episodes of The Avengers were reused. Of the first series, two complete episodes still exist, as 16 mm film telerecordings. One of the episodes remaining does not feature Steed. The first 15 minutes of the first episode also exists as a telerecording; the extant footage ends at the conclusion of the first act, prior to the introduction of John Steed.\n\nThe missing television episodes are currently being re-created for audio by Big Finish Productions under the title of The Avengers - The Lost Episodes  and star Julian Wadham as Steed, Anthony Howell as Dr. Keel and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson.\n\n1962–64: With Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), Venus Smith (Julie Stevens) and Dr Martin King (Jon Rollason)\n\nProduction of the first series was cut short by a strike. By the time production could begin on the second series, Hendry had quit to pursue a film career. Macnee was promoted to star and Steed became the focus of the series, initially working with a rotation of three different partners. Dr Martin King (Jon Rollason), a thinly disguised rewriting of Keel, saw action in only three episodes produced from scripts written for the first series. King was intended to be a transitional character between Keel and Steed's two new female partners, but while the Dr. King episodes were shot first, they were shown out of production order in the middle of the season. The character was thereafter quickly and quietly dropped.\n\nNightclub singer Venus Smith (Julie Stevens) appeared in six episodes. She was a complete \"amateur,\" meaning that she did not have any professional crime-fighting skills as did the two doctors. She was excited to be participating in a \"spy\" adventure alongside secret agent Steed (although some episodes—\"The Removal Men\", \"The Decapod\"—indicate she is not always enthusiastic). Nonetheless, she appears to be attracted to him and their relationship is somewhat similar to that later portrayed between Steed and Tara King. Her episodes featured musical interludes showcasing her singing performances. The character of Venus underwent some revision during her run, adopting more youthful demeanor and dress.\n\nThe first episode broadcast in the second series had introduced the partner who would change the show into the format for which it is most remembered. Honor Blackman played Dr Cathy Gale, a self-assured, quick-witted anthropologist who was skilled in judo and had a passion for leather clothes.  Widowed during the Mau Mau years in Kenya, she was the \"talented amateur\" who saw her aid to Steed's cases as a service to her nation. She was said to have been born 5 October 1930 at midnight and raised in Africa. Gale was early-to-mid 30s during her tenure, in contrast to female characters in similar series who tended to be younger.\n\nGale was unlike any female character seen before on British TV and became a household name. Reportedly, part of her charm was because her earliest appearances were episodes in which dialogue written for Keel was simply transferred to her. Said series script writer Dennis Spooner \"there's the famous story of how Honor Blackman played Ian Hendry's part, which is why they stuck her in leather and such—it was so much cheaper than changing the lines!\"  In \"Conspiracy of Silence\" she holds her own in a vociferous tactical disagreement with her partner.\n\nVenus Smith did not return for the third series and Cathy Gale became Steed's only regular partner. The series established a level of sexual tension between Steed and Gale, but the writers were not allowed to go beyond flirting and innuendo. Despite this the relationship between Steed and Gale was progressive for 1962–63. In \"The Golden Eggs\" it is revealed that Gale lived in Steed's flat; her rent according to Steed was to keep the refrigerator well-stocked and to cook for him (she appears to do neither). However, this was said to be a temporary arrangement while Gale looked for a new home, and Steed was sleeping at a hotel.\n\nDuring the first series there were hints Steed worked for a branch of British Intelligence, and this was expanded in the second series. Steed initially received orders from different superiors, including someone referred to as \"Charles,\" and \"One-Ten\" (Douglas Muir). By the third series the delivery of Steed's orders was not depicted on screen or explained. In \"The Nutshell\" the secret organization to which Steed belongs is shown, and it is Gale's first visit to their HQ.\n\nSmall references to Steed's background were occasionally made. In series three's \"Death of a Batman\" it was said that Steed was with I Corps in World War II, and in Munich in 1945. In series four episode \"The Hour That Never Was\" Steed attends a reunion of his RAF regiment. Since the ties he wears are either cavalry or old school, he apparently had attended a number of leading public schools.\n\nA film version of the series was in its initial planning stages by late 1963 after series three was completed. An early story proposal paired Steed and Gale with a male and female duo of American agents, to make the movie appeal to the American market. Before the project could gain momentum Blackman was cast opposite Sean Connery in Goldfinger, requiring her to leave the series.\n\nSeries transformation\n\nDuring the Gale era, Steed was transformed from a rugged trenchcoat-wearing agent into the stereotypical English gentleman, complete with Savile Row suit, bowler hat, and umbrella with clothes later designed by Pierre Cardin (Steed had first donned bowler and carried his distinctive umbrella part way through the first season as \"The Frighteners\" depicts). The bowler and umbrella were soon changed to be full of tricks including a sword hidden within the umbrella handle and a steel plate concealed in the hat. These items were referred to in the French, German, and Polish titles of the series, Chapeau melon et bottes de cuir (\"Bowler hat and leather boots\"), Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone (\"With Umbrella, Charm and Bowler Hat\") and Rewolwer i melonik (\"A Revolver and a Bowler Hat\"), respectively. With his impeccable manners, old world sophistication, and vintage automobiles, Steed came to represent the traditional Englishman of an earlier era.\n\nBy contrast his partners were youthful, forward-looking, and always dressed in the latest mod fashions. Gale's innovative leather outfits suited her many athletic fight scenes. Honor Blackman became a star in Britain with her black leather outfits and boots (nicknamed \"kinky boots\") and her judo-based fighting style. She also carried a pistol in \"Killer Whale\". Macnee and Blackman even released a novelty song called \"Kinky Boots.\" Some of the clothes seen in The Avengers were designed at the studio of John Sutcliffe, who published the AtomAge fetish magazine.\n\nSeries script writer Dennis Spooner said that the series would frequently feature Steed visiting busy public places such as the main airport in London without anyone else present in the scene. \"'Can't you afford extras?' they'd ask. Well, it wasn't like that. It's just that Steed had to be alone to be accepted. Put him in a crowd and he sticks out like a sore thumb! Let's face it, with normal people he's weird. The trick to making him acceptable is never to show him in a normal world, just fighting villains who are odder than he is!\"\n\n1965–68: With Emma Peel (Diana Rigg)\n\nIn 1965 the show was sold to a United States network, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The Avengers became one of the first British series to be aired on prime time U.S. television. The ABC network paid the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million for the first 26 episodes. The average budget for each episode was reportedly £56,000, which was high for the British industry. The fourth series aired in the U.S. from March to December 1966.\n\nThe U.S. deal meant that the producers could afford to start shooting the series on 35mm film. The use of film rather than videotape as in the earlier episodes was essential as British 405-line video was technically incompatible with the U.S. NTSC videotape format. Filmed productions were standard on U.S. prime time television at that time. The Avengers continued to be produced in black and white.\n\nThe transfer to film meant that episodes would be shot using the single camera setup, giving the production greater flexibility. The use of film production and the single-camera production style allowed more sophisticated visuals and camera angles and more outdoor location shots, all of which greatly improved the look of the series. As was standard on British television filmed production through the 1960s, all location work on series four was shot mute with the soundtrack created in post production. Dialogue scenes were filmed in the studio, leading to some jumps between location and studio footage.\n\nNew female partner Mrs Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) debuted in this series in October 1965. The name of the character derived from a comment by writers, during development, that they wanted a character with \"man appeal.\" In an early attempt to incorporate this concept into the character's name, she was called \"Samantha Peel\" shortened to the awkward \"Mantha Peel\". Eventually the writers began referring to the idea by the verbal shorthand \"M. Appeal\" which gave rise to the character's ultimate name.  Emma Peel, whose husband went missing while flying over the Amazon, retained the self-assuredness of Gale, combined with superior fighting skills, intelligence, and a contemporary fashion sense.\n\nAfter more than 60 actresses had been auditioned, the first choice to play the role was Elizabeth Shepherd. However, after filming one and a half episodes (the pilot, \"The Town of No Return\", and part of \"The Murder Market\"), Shepherd was released. Her on-screen personality was deemed less interesting than that of Blackman's Gale and it was decided she was not right for the role. Another 20 actresses were auditioned before the show's casting director suggested that producers Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell check out a televised drama featuring the relatively unknown Rigg (she had earlier guested in an episode of the TV show, \"The Sentimental Agent,\" that Clemens had written). Her screen test with Macnee showed that the two immediately worked well together.\n\nA prologue was added to the beginning of all the fourth-series episodes for the American transmissions. This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard; a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) walk up to the body as the voiceover explains: \"Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers.\" During this voice-over, Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together. Fade to black and then the opening titles proper begin.\n\nIn contrast to the Gale episodes, there is a lighter, comic touch in Steed and Peel's interactions with each other and their reactions to other characters and situations. Earlier series had a harder tone, with the Gale era including some quite serious espionage dramas. This almost completely disappeared as Steed and Peel visibly enjoy topping each other's witticisms. The layer of conflict with Gale—who on occasion openly resented being used by Steed, often without her permission—is absent from Steed's interaction with Peel. Also the sexual tension between Steed and Gale is quite different from the tension between Steed and Peel.  In both cases, the exact relationship between the partners is left ambiguous, although they seemed to have carte blanche to visit each other's homes whenever they please, and it is not uncommon for scenes to suggest Steed had spent the night at Gale's or Peel's home, or vice versa. Although nothing \"improper\" is displayed, the obviously much closer chemistry between Steed and Peel constantly suggests intimacy between the two.\n\nScience fiction and fantasy elements (a style later known as spy-fi) also begin to emerge in stories. The duo encounters killer robots (\"The Cybernauts\"), telepaths (\"Too Many Christmas Trees\") and giant alien carnivorous plants (\"The Man-Eater of Surrey Green\").\n\nIn her fourth episode, \"Death at Bargain Prices,\" Mrs Peel takes an undercover job at a department store. Her uniform for promoting space-age toys is an elaborate leather catsuit plus silver boots, sash and welder's gloves. The suit minus the silver accessories becomes her signature outfit which she wore primarily for fight scenes in early episodes and in the titles. Some episodes contain a fetishistic undercurrent. In \"A Touch of Brimstone\" Mrs Peel dresses in a dominatrix outfit of corset, laced boots and spiked collar to become the \"Queen of Sin.\"\n\nPeel's avant-garde fashions, featuring bold accents and high-contrast geometric patterns, emphasize her youthful, contemporary personality. For the 1965 season, some of her most memorable outfits were designed by John Bates, including graphic black and white Op art mini-coats and accessories, and a silver ensemble comprising a bra bodice, low-slung trousers, and jacket.  She represents the modern England of the Sixties – just as Steed, with his vintage style and mannerisms, personifies Edwardian era nostalgia. According to Macnee in his book The Avengers and Me, Rigg disliked wearing leather and insisted on a new line of fabric athletic wear for the fifth series. Alun Hughes, who had designed clothing for Diana Rigg's personal wardrobe, was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel's \"softer\" new wardrobe. Pierre Cardin was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee. In America, TV Guide ran a four-page photospread on Rigg's new \"Emmapeeler\" outfits (10–16 June 1967). Eight tight-fitting jumpsuits in a variety of bright colours were created using the stretch fabric crimplene.\n\nFifth series\n\nAfter one filmed series (of 26 episodes) in black and white, The Avengers began filming in colour for the fifth series in 1966. It was three years before Britain's ITV network began full colour broadcasting. This series was broadcast in the U.S. from January to May 1967. The American prologue of the previous series was rejigged for the colour episodes. It opened with the caption The Avengers In Color (required by ABC for colour series at that time). This was followed by Steed unwrapping the foil from a champagne bottle and Peel shooting the cork away. (Unlike the \"chessboard\" opening of the previous series, this new prologue was also included in UK broadcasts of the series.)\n\nThe first 16 episodes of the fifth series begin with Peel receiving a call-to-duty message from Steed: \"Mrs Peel, we're needed.\" Peel was conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift, at which point Steed suddenly appeared (usually in her apartment). The messages were delivered by Steed in increasingly bizarre ways as the series progressed: in a newspaper Peel had just bought, or on traffic lights while she was out driving. On one occasion Steed appeared on her television set, interrupting an old science-fiction movie (actually clips from their Year Four episode \"The Cybernauts\") to call her to work. Another way Steed contacted her was in the beginning of episode 13, \"A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Station\" when she enters her flat and sees a Meccano Percy the Small Engine going around a circular track with a note on one of the train cars that says \"Mrs. Peel\" in bold letters, she then walks over to Steed who says, \"You're needed.\" At the start of \"The Hidden Tiger\" Peel is redecorating her apartment (wearing a jumpsuit and drinking champagne); she peels off a strip of wallpaper, revealing the words \"Mrs Peel\" painted on the wall beneath. She turns to see Steed in the apartment removing another strip of wallpaper, revealing \"We're needed\" painted underneath on another wall. In another instance Emma enters Steed's flat to find he has just fallen down the stairs, and he painfully gasps, \"Mrs Peel, you're needed.\" Often the episode's tag scene returned to the situation of the \"Mrs Peel, we're needed\" scene. \"The Hidden Tiger\" returns to the partially redecorated apartment where Steed begins painting a love heart and arrow and the initials of two people on the wall, but paints over the initials when Peel sees his graffito. In \"The Superlative Seven\" the call to duty and the tag both involve a duck shooting situation where unexpected items fall from the sky after shots are fired.\n\nThe series also introduced a comic tag line caption to the episode title, using the format of \"Steed [does this], Emma [does that].\" For example \"The Joker\" had the opening caption: \"Steed trumps an ace, Emma plays a lone hand.\" (\"The Joker\" was to a large extent a re-write of \"Don't Look Behind You\", a b/w episode with Cathy Gale. A few other later colour episodes were re-writes of b/w episodes.)\n\nThe \"Mrs Peel, we're needed\" scenes and the alternate tag lines were dropped after the first 16 episodes, after a break in production, for financial reasons. They were deemed by the U.K. networks as disposable if The Avengers was to return to ITV screens. (Dave Rogers' book The Avengers Anew lists a set for every Steed/Peel episode except \"The Forget-Me-Knot\".)\n\nStories were increasingly characterized by a futuristic, science-fiction bent, with mad scientists and their creations wreaking havoc. The duo dealt with being shrunk to doll size (\"Mission... Highly Improbable\"), pet cats being electrically altered into ferocious and lethal \"miniature tigers\" (\"The Hidden Tiger\"), killer automata (\"Return of The Cybernauts\"), mind-transferring machines (\"Who's Who???\"), and invisible foes (\"The See-Through Man\").\n\nThe series parodied its American contemporaries with episodes such as \"The Girl From AUNTIE\", \"Mission... Highly Improbable\" and \"The Winged Avenger\" (spoofing The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Mission: Impossible and Batman, respectively). The show still carried the basic format: Steed and his associate were charged with solving the problem in the space of a 50-minute episode, thus preserving the safety of 1960s Britain.\n\nHumour was evident in the names and acronyms of the organizations. For example, in \"The Living Dead\", two rival groups examine reported ghost sightings: FOG (Friends Of Ghosts) and SMOG (Scientific Measurement Of Ghosts). \"The Hidden Tiger\" features the Philanthropic Union for Rescue, Relief and Recuperation of Cats—PURRR—led by characters named Cheshire, Manx, and Angora.\n\nThe series also occasionally adopted a metafictional tone, coming close to breaking the fourth wall. In the series 5 episode \"Something Nasty in the Nursery\" Peel directly references the series' storytelling convention of having potentially helpful sources of information killed off just before she or Steed arrive. This then occurs a few minutes later. In the tag scene for the same episode, Steed and Peel tell viewers—indirectly—to tune in next week.\n\nFor this series Diana Rigg's stunt double was stuntwoman Cyd Child, though stuntman Peter Elliot doubled for Rigg in a stunt dive in \"The Bird Who Knew Too Much\".\n\nRigg's departure\n\nRigg was initially unhappy with the way she was treated by the show's producers. During her first series she learned she was being paid less than the camera man. She demanded a raise, to put her more on a par with her co-star, or she would leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show's great popularity in the US.  At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, in this case On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\n\nRigg and Macnee remained lifelong friends.\n\nOn 25 October 2015, to mark 50 years of Emma Peel, the BFI (British Film Institute) screened an episode of The Avengers followed by an onstage interview with Rigg, during which she discussed her reasons for leaving the show and Patrick Macnee's reaction to her departure. \n\n1968–69: With Tara King (Linda Thorson)\n\nWhen Diana Rigg left the series in October 1967, the British network executives decided that the current series formula, despite resulting in popular success, could not be pursued further. Thus they decided that a \"return to realism\" was appropriate for the sixth series (1968–69). Brian Clemens and Albert Fennel were replaced by John Bryce, producer of most of the Cathy Gale-era episodes.\n\nBryce had a difficult situation in hand. He had to find a replacement for Diana Rigg and shoot the first seven episodes of the new series, which were supposed to be shipped to America together with the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes.\n\nBryce signed his then-girlfriend, 20-year-old newcomer Linda Thorson, as the new female co-star and chose the name \"Tara King\" for her character. Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart; and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy and Emma, the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and King. King also differed from Steed's previous partners in that she was a fully fledged (albeit initially inexperienced) agent working for Steed's organisation; his previous partners had all been (in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series) talented amateurs. Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde, so Thorson's brown hair was bleached. However the process badly damaged Thorson's hair, so she had to wear wigs for the first third of her episodes, until her own hair grew back. Her natural brown hair was not seen until the episode \"All Done with Mirrors\".\n\nProduction of the first seven episodes of the sixth series began. However financial problems and internal difficulties undermined Bryce's effort. He only managed to complete three episodes: \"Invitation to a Killing\" (a 90-minute episode introducing Tara King), \"The Great, Great Britain Crime\" (some of its original footage was reused in the 1969 episode \"Homicide and Old Lace\") and \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" (which survived relatively intact except for the scenes in which Tara wears a brown wig.)\n\nAfter a rough cut screening of these episodes to studio executives, Bryce was fired and Clemens and Fennel were summoned back.  At their return, a fourth episode called \"The Murderous Connection\" was in its second day of production.  After revising the script, it was renamed as \"The Curious Case of the Countless Clues\" and production was resumed. Production of the episode \"Split!\", a leftover script from the Emma Peel colour series, proceeded. Two completely new episodes were also shot: \"Get-A-Way\", and \"Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers\".\n\nDennis Spooner said of the event that \"Brian left The Avengers for about three episodes, someone took over, and when Brian came back, it was in a terrible state. He was faced with doing a rewrite on a film they'd already shot.\" The episode had a story error where Steed leaves for a destination. The villains then realise this and pursue him – yet arrive there before Steed does. It was fixed by having a character ask Steed 'What took you so long?', to which he replies 'I came the pretty way'. \"You can only do that on The Avengers you see. It was just my favourite show to work on.\" \n\nClemens and Fennel decided to film a new episode to introduce Tara King. This, the third episode filmed for the sixth series, was titled \"The Forget-Me-Knot\" and bade farewell to Emma Peel and introduced her successor, a trained but inexperienced agent named Tara King. It would be broadcast as the first episode of the sixth series. Tara debuts in dynamic style: when Steed is called to Headquarters, he is attacked and knocked down by trainee agent King who mistakes him for her training partner.\n\nNo farewell scenes for Emma Peel had been shot when Diana Rigg left the series. Rigg was recalled for \"The Forget-Me-Knot\", through which Emma acts as Steed's partner as usual. Rigg also filmed a farewell scene for Emma which appeared as the tag scene of the episode. It was explained that Emma's husband, Peter Peel, was found alive and rescued, and she left the British secret service to be with him. Emma visits Steed to say goodbye, and while leaving she passes Tara on the stairway giving the advice that \"He likes his tea stirred anti-clockwise.\" Steed looks out the window as a departing Emma enters the Bentley driven by Peter – who from a distance seems to resemble Steed (and was played by Steed's regular stunt-double, wearing a bowler hat and umbrella).\n\nBryce's original episode introducing Tara, \"Invitation to a Killing\", was revised as a regular 60-minute episode named \"Have Guns Will Haggle\". These episodes, together with \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" and the last eight Peel colour episodes, were shipped to America in February 1968.\n\nFor this series the government official who gave Steed his orders was depicted on screen. Mother, introduced in \"The Forget-Me-Knot\", is a man in a wheelchair. The role was taken by Patrick Newell who had played different roles in two earlier episodes, most recently in series five. Mother's headquarters would shift from place to place, including one episode where his complete office was on the top level of a double-decker bus. (Several James Bond films of the 1970s would make use of a similar gimmick for Bond's briefings.)\n\nAdded later as a regular was Mother's mute Amazonian assistant, Rhonda, played by uncredited actress Rhonda Parker. There was one appearance by an agency official code-named \"Father\", a blind older woman played by Iris Russell. (Russell had appeared in the series several times previously in other roles.) In one episode, \"Killer\", Steed is paired with Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney (Jennifer Croxton) while King is on holiday.\n\nScriptwriter Dennis Spooner later reflected on this series. \"When I wrote 'Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers', that was definitely the last series. They were going to make no more, so in that series we went right over the top; we went really weird, because they knew there weren't going to be any more.\" \n\nSpooner said the series \"worked because it became a parody on itself, almost. You can only do that so long.\" Overall he attributes the success of the show to its light approach. \"We spoofed everything, we took Mission: Impossible, Bad Day at Black Rock, High Noon, The Dirty Dozen, The Birds... we took them all. The film buffs used to love it. There were always lines in it that people knew what we were talking about.\"\n\nThe revised series continued to be broadcast in America. The episodes with Linda Thorson as King proved to be highly rated in Europe and the UK. In the United States however, the ABC network that carried the series chose to air it opposite the number one show in the country at the time, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. Steed and King could not compete, and the show was cancelled in the US. Without this vital commercial backing, production could not continue in Britain either, and the series ended in May 1969. The final scene of the final episode (\"Bizarre\") has Steed and King, champagne glasses in hand, accidentally launching themselves into orbit aboard a rocket, as Mother breaks the fourth wall and says to the audience, \"They'll be back!\" before adding in shock, \"They're unchaperoned up there!\"\n\nMusic\n\nThe 1961 series featured a jazz-influenced theme by John Dankworth. Library music was used sparsely as a soundtrack, sometimes with variations based on the main theme. Dankworth's theme music was reworked for the third series. Dankworth's first theme was recorded on the Columbia label, on a 45rpm single, and a new recording, similar to the reworked television theme was issued on Fontana in 1963. A very faithful cover version was released by Johnny Gregory.\n\nWhen Rigg joined the series in 1965, new theme music by Laurie Johnson was introduced. This was based on a previously released title, on LP called \"The Shake\"   (which capitalized on \"The Shake\" dance craze of the 60s  ). For the colour series (1967), a percussion section was added, to accompany the new teaser sequence at the start of each episode. Johnson re-scored the theme when Linda Thorson joined the series, adding a counter melody on trumpet, based on the leitmotif for Tara King from the final Rigg episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot\". The new theme debuted in the closing titles of the episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot\", which introduced Thorson. It was altogether more dynamic, and included a much more frenetic percussion section, for the revised teaser sequence. Importantly, the filmed episodes contained specially composed scores by Johnson.  To accompany Steed's request \"Mrs Peel – you're needed!\", he composed a brief 'sting', and there was also a special theme for 'Emma'. For the 'Thorson' series, a characteristic piece was composed to accompany the tag scene, at the end of each episode. Many of the most memorable cues from the Rigg/Thorson series, including the opening, and closing titles themes, and the 'Tag Scene' were released commercially on CD in 2009.\n\nOwing to a professional commitment to score for the film Hot Millions (starring Peter Ustinov, and Maggie Smith), Johnson requested assistance from his keyboard player, Howard Blake, who scored some of the episodes of the final season, as well as additional music for other episodes which Johnson did not have time to complete. These were composed in a style remarkably similar to Johnson's, probably by request, or a sense of allegiance. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of the series, these almost complete scores by Blake, including Johnson's main, and end titles themes, were issued on a double CD set. Of the original Johnson theme, countless cover versions have been released on vinyl and CD, and the opening motif was retained on the series The New Avengers.\n\nJohnson subsequently collaborated with Clemens on other projects, including the theme for The New Avengers.\n\nCars\n\nThe automobiles used in the series became almost as famous as the actors.    From the 4th season on, Steed's signature cars were six vintage green 1926–1928 Bentley racing or town cars, including Blower Bentleys and Bentley Speed Sixes (although, uniquely, in \"The Thirteenth Hole\" he drives a Vauxhall 30-98).  In the final season he drove two yellow Rolls Royces -- a 1923 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost and a 1927 Rolls Royce New Phantom.   Peel drove Lotus Elan convertibles (a white 1964 and a powder blue 1966),   which, like her clothes, emphasized her independence and vitality. During the first Peel series (Season 4), each episode ended with a short, humorous scene of the duo leaving the scene of their most recent adventure in some unusual vehicle.  Mother occasionally appeared in silver Rolls-Royce. Tara King drove an AC 428 and a Lotus Europa. Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney drove an MGC Roadster.\n\nProduction team\n\nSydney Newman, who would later go on to spearhead the creation of Doctor Who for the BBC, never received screen credit as the creator of The Avengers. In his memoir, The Avengers and Me, Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about this. Newman explained that he never sought on-screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, such credits were not given, and he never thought to get one for The Avengers. \n\nThe production team changed during the series' long run, particularly between the third and fourth series, but the influence of Brian Clemens was felt throughout. He wrote the second episode and became the series' most prolific scriptwriter. Succeeding producers Leonard White and John Bryce, Julian Wintle became the producer of the 4th series with Brian Clemens credited as Associate Producer and Albert Fennell credited as \"In charge of production\". Series 5, made by A.B.C. Television Films, (which was created during the run up to Associated British Corporation and Associated-Redifussion forming Thames TV) Clemens and Fennell became co-producers, with Wintle as Executive Producer. For series 6, after its first producer John Bryce left, Clemens and Fennell returned as co-producers, early episodes also credit Julian Wintle as Consultant to the series and Philip Levene as Story Consultant.\n\nRay Austin became the fight arranger for series 4 and 5, introducing kung fu to the series. Ray Austin had been training with Chee Soo and they worked techniques from Feng Shou Kung fu and T'ai Chi into the fight scenes and credit sequences. Ray Austin, Diana Rigg and Chee Soo were later awarded a Guinness world record  as the first people to show kung fu on television. Later he became a prolific television director. Joe Dunne took over for series 6.\n\nReception in North America\n\nAlthough telerecordings of the second and third series were seen in Canada as early as 1963, the first two series of The Avengers were not broadcast on television in the United States. ABC purchased the rights to broadcast seasons 3 and 4 in the United States in 1965. The sale of The Avengers to United States television prompted a change in production style from the 405-line British multi-camera stand to the single camera shooting method, originated on 35 mm film.\n\nThe series' stunt man and stunt arranger Ray Austin expressed the opinion that the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There The Avengers was given a late timeslot due to its violence. \"They did that with the first Avengers here [in the U.S.], with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS , because it was too violent.\" Austin goes on to explain that U.S. television follows a \"different code\". Austin said that on The Avengers \"we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no one was going to stop us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York—you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it.\"  In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10:00 pm on ABC.  The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7:30 pm, also on ABC. \n\nAmerican censors objected to some content, in particular the episode \"A Touch of Brimstone\" which featured a modern day version of the Hellfire Club and climaxed with Emma being dressed in a skimpy corset costume with spiked collar and high heel boots to become the Queen of Sin, and being attacked with a whip by guest star Peter Wyngarde. The American broadcast network refused to air it.  In total five episodes from the first Emma Peel series were not initially broadcast by ABC.   These were: \"A Surfeit of H2O\", \"Silent Dust\" (which featured Emma being attacked with a horsewhip), \"Quick-Quick Slow Death\", \"A Touch of Brimstone\" and \"Honey for the Prince\" (in which Emma performed the dance of the seven veils), although they were seen in later syndicated repeats.\n\nEarlier Cathy Gale and Venus Smith episodes had aired in Canada before the arrival of Mrs. Peel. U.S. audiences saw the 1962–1964 Gale and Smith episodes of the series for the first time in the early 1990s when they were broadcast on the A&E Network. No Keel episode of the series repeatedly was ever broadcast outside Britain, and even in the UK only one episode, \"The Frighteners\", was rebroadcast (as part of a run of classic episodes on Channel 4 in early 1993, otherwise mostly consisting of Gale episodes). \n\nReruns of The Avengers now currently air on the NBCUniversal-owned digital subchannel network Cozi TV.\n\nEpisodes\n\nSix series of The Avengers were made between 1961 and 1969. There was an enforced break in filming and transmission towards the end of series five due to financial problems. Television researcher Andrew Pixley and authors Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping in their book The Avengers Dossier: The Unauthorised and Unofficial Guide consider the last eight episodes produced after the break as constituting a short series six, and therefore count seven series in total. Within the internal production of The Avengers the last eight episodes were considered to be a continuation of series five.\n\nEpisode copies and DVDs\n\nAll original videotapes from series one, two and three, which were shot on video, were wiped.\n\nOnly two complete episodes from the show's first series are known to exist, as 16mm film telerecordings. These are \"The Frighteners\", an extract of which is playing on a television in the film Quadrophenia, and \"Girl on the Trapeze\", which was found in the UCLA Film and Television Archive via an internet search of their on-line database. Part of the show's first episode was found in the United States. The footage is of the episode's first 21 minutes, up to the first commercial break.\n\nAll series two and three episodes survive as 16mm telerecordings. These have been released to DVD, as have all of the Emma Peel and Tara King episodes, which were shot on film. The two surviving complete Keel episodes, plus the remnant of the first episode, have also been released in the UK and US, but are not currently available in the US.\n\nThe New Avengers\n\nThe sustained popularity of the Tara King episodes in France led to a 1975 French television advertisement for a brand of champagne with Thorson and Macnee reprising their roles. The advertisement's success spurred financing interest in France for new episodes of The Avengers.\n\nThe result was a new series, The New Avengers. Patrick Macnee reprised the role of Steed, with two new partners, Mike Gambit (Gareth Hunt) and Purdey (Joanna Lumley). It aired on ITV in the UK in 1976–1977, CTV in Canada, CBS in the United States (in 1978/79) and TF1 in France (series 1 in 1976–1977 and series 2 in 1979). The final four episodes were almost completely produced by Canadian interests and were filmed there. In some markets they carried the title The New Avengers in Canada.\n\nSpin-offs\n\nNovels\n\nA number of original novels based on the series were published in the 1960s.  The first by Douglas Enefer, published by Consul Books, was the only 60s novel to feature Cathy Gale. In the UK, Panther books published four novels written by John Garforth featuring Emma Peel in 1967. These were reprinted in the US by Berkley Medallion books. After Panther stopped publishing Avengers novels in the UK, Berkley Medallion continued publishing original novels of their own: one featuring Emma Peel and four featuring Tara King for the US market only; three by Keith Laumer in 1968; and two by Norman Daniels 1968/69. Berkley Medallion later re-printed all nine novels with new covers that featured photos of both Rigg and Thorson, regardless of which Avengers girl appeared in the novel. The two novels published by Hodder and Stoughton in 1965/66 were co-written by Patrick Macnee, making him one of the first actors to write licensed spin-off fiction of their own shows. The Macnee novels, Deadline and Dead Duck, were reprinted in the UK by Titan Books in standard paperback in 1994 and in France by Huitieme Art (1995 & 1996). They were also published in the USA for the first time by TV Books in 1998. Titan reissued the books in trade paperback format (with the same covers) to coincide with the release of the feature film The Avengers.\n\nThe 1990 novel Too Many Targets by John Peel featured all of Steed's partners (David Keel, Cathy Gale, Emma Peel and Tara King) with the exception of Venus Smith and Dr Martin King.\n\n* The Avengers, Douglas Enefer, 1963\n* Deadline, Patrick Macnee and Peter Leslie, 1965\n* Dead Duck, Macnee and Leslie, 1966\n* The Floating Game, John Garforth, 1967\n* The Laugh Was on Lazarus, Garforth, 1967\n* The Passing of Gloria Munday, Garforth, 1967\n* Heil Harris!, Garforth, 1967\n* The Afrit Affair, Keith Laumer, 1968\n* The Drowned Queen, Laumer, 1968\n* The Gold Bomb, Laumer, 1968\n* The Magnetic Man, Norman A.

Both of the Macnee/Leslie UK paperback titles were translated and published in Portugal in 1967 as 'Os Vingadores: O Dia Depois De Amanha' (deadline) and 'Os Vingadores: O Pato Morto' (dead duck) by Deaga. All four UK John Garforth Panther book paperbacks were translated and published by Roman in France (1967), a paperback omnibus edition was published in 1998 by Fleuve Noir. Three of the Garforth paperbacks were also translated and published by Heyne in Germany (1967/68) ('Heil Harris!' was not translated for obvious reasons.) and a German hardback omnibus edition of the three titles was published by Lichtenberg (1968), reprinted in paperback by Heyne in 1998. All four titles were also translated and published in the Netherlands by Bruna (1967) and in Chile by Zig-Zag (1968). \n\nComics\n\nThe first UK Avengers comic strips  featuring Steed and Cathy Gale first appeared in regional TV listings magazines 'Look Westward' and 'The Viewer' from 14 September 1963 to 9 May 1964, (later in 1964, re-printed in the 'Manchester Evening News' newspaper.) this run consisted of 4 serials. Steed and Mrs Peel comic strips began in 'TV Comic' in issue 720, dated 2 October 1965, beginning after the TV debut of Emma Peel and ran until issue 771, dated 24 September 1966 (this run consisted of 10 serials plus one four page one off in TV Comic Holiday Special June 1966), when the rights were sold to publishers D.C. Thomson & Co. Ltd, where the next version of the strip appeared in issue 199, dated 10 December 1966, of 'Diana' the popular paper for girls, its run ended in issue 224, dated 2 June 1967, with art by Emilio Frejo and Juan Gonzalez Alacrojo, this run consisted of 8 serials. Earlier, 'The Growing Up of Emma Peel' comic strip had appeared in 'June and Schoolfriend' comic from issue 52, dated 29 January 1966, to issue 63, dated 16 April 1966, this had featured the adventures of 14-year-old Emma Knight and was run concurrent with the TV Comic strip and consisted of 11 instalments. The Avengers returned to TV comic issue 877, dated 5 October 1968, just after Tara King debuted on TV, the Tara & Steed strip continued until issue 1077, dated 5 August 1972, this run consisted of 28 serials plus one four page one off in TV Comic Holiday Special 1972. Also in 1966 Thorpe & Porter published a 68 page Avengers comic featuring Steed & Peel with original art by Mike Anglo and Mick Austin, this consisted of four 16 pages stories.\n\nA few The Avengers-related comic books have been published in the USA. They are not named The Avengers because the rights to the names \"Avengers\" and \"New Avengers\" are held by Marvel Comics for use with their Avengers comics depicting a team of superheroes called The Avengers. Gold Key Comics published one issue of John Steed Emma Peel in 1968 (subtitled The Avengers on the Indicia page), which included two newly-coloured and reformatted The Avengers strips from \"TV Comic\". A three-issue miniseries entitled Steed and Mrs Peel appeared from 1990–1992 under the Eclipse Comics imprint, it featured a three-part story, 'The Golden Game' in book 1–3, by Grant Morrison and a two-part story, in book 2 & 3, 'A Deadly Rainbow' by Anne Caulfield, both strips had art by Ian Gibson. Boom! Studios reprinted this series in six issues in early 2012, and later published a new ongoing series written by Mark Waid and Caleb Monroe which lasted 12 issues. Boom! subsequently announced a six-issue follow-up series, Steed and Mrs. Peel: We're Needed, which is to launch during the summer of 2014.  Despite issue 1 showing \"1 of 6\", only 3 issues were produced (\"2 of 3\" and \"3 of 3\" showing on the other issues, with the cover for issue 3 being the one originally planned for issue 4 which was planned to be the start of another 3-issue story).\n\nIn the UK, where hard back annuals are traditionally produced for sale at Christmas, The Avengers first appeared in 'TV Crimebusters Annual' (1962) and featured a 7 page comic strip with Dr. David Keel titled 'The Drug Pedlar'. And Atlas publications produced three 'The Avengers' hard back Annuals for 1967, 1968 and 1969, which also featured original Avengers comic strips featuring Steed, Emma Peel and Tara King, as well as text stories.\n\nThe TV Comic Avengers strips and the 1966 Avengers comic and a few comic strips from the Annuals have been translated and published in Germany, the Netherlands, France and Chile.\n\nThe Avengers also have made a number of cameo appearances in comics over the years.\n\n*In 1991’s Doctor Who Monthly #173, Gary Russell and artists Mike Collins and Steve Pini show Captain Britain about to hit John Steed when Emma Peel shows up behind him.\n*Emma Peel and John Steed were seen among the crowd in a bar scene in Kingdom Come #2 (1996) by Mark Waid and Alex Ross.\n*Emma Peel and John Steed appeared unnamed in Superman #13 (1988) by John Byrne and Karl Kesel.\n*A crossover series, Batman '66 Meets Steed And Mrs Peel, was launched in June 2016 as a joint effort between DC Comics and Boom! Studios.  \n\nStage play\n\nA stage version of The Avengers was produced in Britain in 1971, written by TV series veterans Brian Clemens and Terence Feely, and directed by Leslie Phillips. It starred Simon Oates as Steed, Sue Lloyd as new partner Hannah Wild, and Kate O'Mara as villainess Madame Gerda. All three actors had played guest roles in the original series. \n\nA character named Hana Wilde (played by Charlotte Rampling) had essentially acted as Steed's partner in series five's \"The Superlative Seven\", an episode in which Emma Peel appears only briefly. According to John Peel in his overview of \"The Superlative Seven\", \"Charlotte Rampling was rumoured to be grooming up to replace Diana Rigg in this story, but nothing ever came of that.\" \n\nRadio series\n\nThe Avengers radio series  was transmitted between 6 December 1971 and 28 December 1973 on Springbok Radio, the English language service of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), it was recorded at Sonovision Studios in Johannesberg, produced by Dave Gooden, the original TV scripts were adapted and directed by Tony Jay, for the 1st six months and Dennis Folbigge for the remainder. South Africa did not have national television until 1976.  The episodes were adapted from both Emma Peel and Tara King episodes (with the Tara King character changed to Emma Peel throughout). The Avengers were played by two British expatriate actors, Donald Monat as Steed and Diane Appleby as Mrs Peel, with Hugh Rouse as the tongue-in-cheek narrator. The stories were adapted into five-episode serials under Tony Jay and six and seven episode serials under Dennis Folbigge, of approximately 15 minutes each (including adverts) and stripped across the week, Monday-Friday, on Springbok Radio.\n\nCurrently only 19 complete serials survive, all from reel-to-reel off-air recordings made by John Wright in 1972. Also the first three episodes of a remake of Escape In Time currently exists, eps 1 & 2 are copies from the original Sonovision tapes, and ep 3 is from an off-air recording, on audio cassette, made by Barbara Peterson, the rest of this serial is still missing. These episodes are also known to have been transmitted in New York on station WBAI on 99.5 FM, from 1977 to the early 1990s, and are currently being transmitted on Miami station WRGP early Monday mornings.\n\nExisting episodes:\n* The Fantasy Game (7 eps) (based on \"\"Honey for the Prince\")\n* The Quick-Quick Slow Death (6 eps)\n* Love All (6 eps)\n* Get-A-Way! (6 eps)\n* A Deadly Gift (6 eps) (based on \"The Cybernauts\")\n* The Super Secret Cypher Snatch (6 eps)\n* Dial A Deadly Number (6 eps)\n* Not To Be Sneezed At (7 eps) (based on \"You'll Catch Your Death\")\n* Who Shot Poor George/XR40? (7 eps)\n* A Grave Change (6 eps) (based on \"Bizarre\")\n* All Done With Mirrors (7 eps)\n* The Morning After (6 eps)\n* The Joker (6 eps)\n* Straight From The Shoulder (6 eps) (based on \"Invitation to a Killing\")\n* Stop Me If You've Heard This (6) (based on \"Look, Stop Me If You've Heard This One Etc.\")\n* From Venus With Love (6 eps)\n* A Case of Interrogation (7 eps) (based on \"The Interrogators\")\n* Too Many Oles (6 eps) (based on \"They Keep Killing Steed\")\n* Train of Events (6 eps) (based on \"A Funny Thing Happened on the way to the Station\")\n* Escape in Time (eps 1–3 only)(a remake of the first serial broadcast in South Africa)\n\nCopies from the original off-air recordings have been restored by Alan and Alys Hayes. And can be heard at their \"The Avengers Declassified\" website and its sister website \"Avengers on the Radio\".\nMany more serials were broadcast during its two-year run on South African Radio, it is thought 83 serials were made and transmitted, but no other episodes are known to exist at present.\n\nFilm\n\nPlans for a motion picture based upon the series circulated during the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s, with Mel Gibson at one point being considered a front-runner for the role of Steed. Ultimately, the 1998 film starring Uma Thurman as Emma Peel and Ralph Fiennes as John Steed, with Sean Connery as the villain, received extremely negative reviews from critics and fans and was a major 1998 film flop.\n\nAudio\n\nOn June 26, 2013, Big Finish Productions announced they had signed a license with StudioCanal to produce full-cast audio productions of 12 lost episodes from Season 1. \n\nThe main cast includes Julian Wadham as Steed, Anthony Howell as Dr. David Keel and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson.  The stories are adapted for audio by John Dorney.\n\nIn January 2014, Volume One containing the first four stories (\"Hot Snow\", \"Brought to Book\", \"Square Root of Evil\" and \"One for the Mortuary\") was released.\n\nVolume Two containing the next four stories (\"Ashes of Roses\", \"Please Don't Feed the Animals\", \"The Radioactive Man\" and \"Dance with Death\") it was released in July 2014. Volume Three containing the next four stories was released in January 2015.\n\nIn March 2014 Big Finish announced that they would be extending the audio recreation programme to include all 26 episodes of Season 1, including the two extant stories. A total of seven boxed sets will be released."

                "Kosovo Battle\npainted by Petar Radicevic 1987\nSaint                Lazar the Great Martyr of Kosovo\nPrince Lazar was born in 1329 in Prilepac to the aristocrat family              Hrebeljanovic. His father Pribac was a Logotet-secretary doing very              confidential work for King Dusan the Powerful in the royal palace.              Young Lazar was raised in the palace, and was respected by the King              who entrusted him with the rule of two parts of his kingdom: Srem              and Macva. Lazar married Milica the daughter of an important aristocrat              named Vratko also known as Yug Bogdan - a very wise and honorable              man from the Nemanjic family. Lazar had three sons: Stevan, Vuk and              Lazar and five daughters: Jelena, Mara, Despa, Vukosava and Mileva.\nKing Dusan the Powerful died unexpectantly in 1355 at the age of 48.              This led to a weakening of Serbia's central government. Many dukes used this opportunity to secede from the Kingdom with the land that              had been entrusted to them. The young son of Dusan Uros took over              the throne and soon was killed. Vukasin Mrnjacevic proclaimed himself              the King of Serbia. At this time, Turks were advancing toward the              Kingdom of Serbia. In a battle on the river Marica in 1371, Vukasin              was killed leaving behind him a weakened, poor and torn Serbia. Serbia              was in desperate need of a gifted statesman, rich in virtue and deserving              of God's Grace: a man similar to St.Sava and his father St. Stefan              Nemanja who had founded the Serbian state. The Church recognized just              such a man in Prince Lazar. His talent for leadership, wisdom and              experience lifted him above those who would seize the throne by force              and sought their own glory and importance.\nPrince Lazar, first sought to consolidate and strengthen the Kingdom.              As was the custom of that day and age, he married his daughters to              the rebellious Serbian aristocrats. This enlarged and stabilized Serbia.              Having thus secured the loyalty of dissident aristocrats, Prince Lazar              turned to those countries which bordered his own, seeking to deepen              Serbia's relationship with them.\nAt this time, the Serbian Orthodox Church was in a dispute with the              Patriarch of Constantinople. King Dusan the Powerful wanted Serbia              to have an independent Church. He single-handedly sought to elevate              the Serbian archbishop to the level of a patriarch. The Patriarch              of Constantinople utterly rejected this act and broke relations with              the Church in Serbia. This was a very serious problem and one which              King Lazar managed to solve by reconciling the Serbian Church and that of Constantinople. It was a result of this reconciliation that              gave the Serbian Church its first canonical Patriarch.\nThe expansion of that Ottoman state, and increasingly frequent Turkish              raids into his land, warned Prince Lazar that the time for a decisive              battle was drawing near. Lengthy preparation on both sides preceded              this confrontation. The fact that the armies were led by the Turkish              ruler Murad 1 and by King Lazar of Serbia illustrates the importance              of this battle. It was decided that the site of the battle would be              a field in Kosovo (Kosovo Polje).\nPrince Lazar knew that his chances against the Turkish aggressor were              small and on the eve of the Battle of Kosovo he gathered his upper              aristocracy and asked if they should fight for the Holy cross and              Golden Freedom or surrender to their adversaries and live as slaves              of the Muslims. They had to chose between the Heavenly Kingdom and              earthly one. In the true spirit of Christianity they preferred to              place their hope in Christ and Eternal Life. The Prince and all of              this warriors took Holy communion and went into battle on Saint Vitus              Day, Tuesday June 15th 1389.\nIn the beginning of the battle Serbian warriors were able to advance.              Milos Obilic, the most famous hero of this Kosovo Battle, killed the              Turkish King Murad. Despite this unexpected development, the Turkish              army re-grouped and over ran the Serbs. They captured Prince Lazar              alive, but beheaded him shortly thereafter.\nToday his earthly remains are amazingly preserved intact and kept              in the monastery Ravanica which was founded by him, along with many              others churches and monasteries. The faithful gather from all Serbia              just as they have through centuries to venerate his Holy relics and              to get comfort and healing and to inspire them in the hope and belief              that better days will come.\nThe              Kosovo Battle\nSt. Prince Lazar on a 19c. Serbian painting\npainted by Adam Stefanovic , 1870-1871\nTHE              EVENTS SURROUNDING THE BATTLE OF KOSOVO 1389 AND ITS CULTURAL EFFECT              ON THE SERBIAN PEOPLE\nby              Mark Gottfried (1972)\nThe              Serbian culture endured through five centuries of Turkish occupation,              although the Turks offered security and prosperity, for conversion              to Turkish life styles. This Serbian culture was retarded for five              centuries, after the Serbian defeat on the plain of Kosovo.\nFrom              a culture that led Europe and the Balkans during the Medieval period,              the Serbian culture degenerated and stagnated, to the point that when              it regained its freedom it had centuries to recover. The Turkish victory              at Kosovo, was not as much political as it was cultural. \"Turkish              historians lay more stress on the Battle of Maritza eighteen years              before, which they call Serb Sindin (Serbian defeat).\" The military              destiny of Serbia was sealed at Maritza. Contemporary chroniclers,              without the benefit of hindsight, felt that Kosovo was only one of              a series of bloody engagements, leading to the collapse of the Serbian              kingdom.\nWhat              then is the importance of the Battle of Kosovo? It was a cultural              defeat, a religious defeat. It became the symbol of Turkish power              and Serbian defeat, not to be forgotten . . . revenge was always over              the horizon. The grand Serbian culture, which flourished under Tzar's              Dushan and Milutin, was only a memory, after Serbia's knights, armies              and hopes died at the field of Kosovo.\n\"The              State was destroyed, but underneath was born from pain and from battle              a strong people.\" It was this strong people, that clung to their              own culture, or a remnant of it against time and the Turks. The Battle              at Kosovo Polje is one of the focal points of their memories, and              as such played a vital role in the Serbian culture.\nThe              binding force in Serbian Culture is its national religion. When in              1190 Nemanja set up a state, from the chaos of the third crusade,              the people's religion was not a national concern. His son, now known              as St. Sava, brought the Eastern Orthodox Church to Serbia, and set              up an oriental culture, leaning toward Byzantium. St. Sava also separated              the church from Byzantine rule, and placed the church establishment              in the service of the nation. This was the first national church,              untied to either Greek Orthodox or Roman dictates. This policy of              separation was continued through Tzar Dushan's reign (1331-1355) when              he planned and executed all possible activities halting the influence              of the Roman church in his state.\nThis              national religion needed a base, or platform to be effective. The              monastery was \"chosen\" for this purpose. In fact by 1430              there were 3,000 monasteries and churches in Serbia. These institutions              were the basic educational and cultural establishments of their day.              An example of the high culture prevalent in the monasteries at the              end of the thirteenth century, Queen Jelena founded a type of \"womans'              home keeping school\" at Brnjeval near today's Kosovska Mitrovica.              The building and maintaining of monasteries and church institutions are shown in many of the ballads from the period, \"The Building              of Ravanitsa\" (a monastery) is one example. This poem speaks              of the construction of a church institution as a duty of the Tzar.\nIn              the Serbian society literacy was limited to a narrow circle, mainly              religious in character. However, there are proofs that literacy often              passed the bounds of the religion sector. An example of the literature              of the time is a biography of St. Sava written by Monk Teodisije in              the thirteenth through fourteenth centuries. The monasteries besides              being centers of education and literature were centers of art.\nIn              these monasteries were created beautiful frescos, paintings, tapestries              and handicrafts. The art of Serbia of the thirteenth century is considered              independent and \"convincingly superior\" to the art of Byzantium. \"On the vast territory of Dusan's empire there were a number              of smaller provincial centers of art . . . in spite of their local              character, the works produced there had two great assets; they were              numerous and of high technical accomplishment,\" The architecture              of the monasteries also represents a special achievement for its time.\nOther              cultural achievements of the Serbs lie in the field of politics and              government. Militarily the Serbs had been on the rise continually              and under Tzar Dushan they controlled Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia,              Albania and parts of Greece. At the time of his death, Tzar Dushan was planning to resist the Turks and attack Constantinople. Under              Tzars Milutin through Dushan, Serbia was moving toward its real mission              as a nation with wealth and power. The advances were not only in military              spheres. Tzar Dushan also gave to the Serbs a law which has importance              to the Serbs and to Southern Slave in general. This law, the Zakonk,              was born of Byzantine and other prevalent laws of the time, and can              be said to be a picture of the Serbian social structure of justice              based on law.\nAfter              Dushan's death the military strength of the autocracy decreased. In              1377 Knez Lazar (ruler of Serbia) was forced to accept the crowning              of Tvrtka I at Milesevo (St. Sava's grave) making him (Tvrtka I) king              of Bosnia, with rights over Serbia. The clash with the Turks found              the Serbs at the teak of their national feeling and culture.\nWhen              fourteenth century Serbia achieved its political peak most European              countries were second-rate powers. Individual nation states were only              evolving in Europe at the time when Serbia's star was already falling.              The \"countries\" of Europe were still subservient to the              church of Rome, until the seventeenth century, while Serbia developed              a national church in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This superior              culture faced the Ottoman Turks. This was a clash of not only military              strength, but of faiths and ways of life.\nThough              the major motivating forces were political, cultural and religious              feelings and motives also played a part in the battle of Kosovo. \"The              Turkish system of occupying conquered countries with military colonies              and carrying off the original inhabitants, excited a great national              opposition in the year 1389.\" This policy which would destroy              the culture and religion of Serbia as well as the state, enraged the              people. They felt that \"the Ottomans were alien barbarians with              a lesser civilization and a religion totally different from that of              the conquered.\" Both the Turks and Serbs were motivated by religious              Ideals; the Turks for Islam, and the Serbs for Christianity.\nBarring              other motives, both parties were politically opposed. The conflict              had begun with small marauding raids the Turks pushed across the Dardanelles.              When they established a foothold in the Balkans the conflict \".              . . progressed too more serious . . . and finally to a full scale              campaign.\"\nIt              is felt that Tzar Dushan might have held back the Turks, but at his              death his empire fragmented. Lacking a common culture or political              tradition the empire collapsed, leaving. Its remnants open to Turkish              encroachment.\n\"Of              course the great task for the Serbian statesman of that time was,              how to stem the further progress of the Ottoman Turks and drive them              back to Asia.\" Knez Lazar as elected chief of Serbia tried to              unify tie country and stop the Turks. \"While Prince Lazar was              Infusing fresh vigor into the Serbian State, the danger from the Turks              was becoming increasingly pressing.\" Knez Lazar began to form              a Christian league against the Turks. It was revealed to Sultan Murad,              who promptly invaded Bulgaria and Serbia to destroy the Christian              league. The political desires of the two nations were diametrically              opposed; the Turks wanted Serbian lands, and the Serbs survival.\nThe              final military struggle, the clash at Kosovo, was a conflict of both              empires, economic systems, religions and hopes. Bulgaria was subdued              first and then in 1339 Amurath (Murad I) marched against Knez Lazar,              ruler of Serbia. \"A great assault on Serbia was organized by              the Sultan Murad I . . . he penetrated to the field of Kosovo.\" \"In great haste he (Lazar) had to summon his noblemen to hurry              with their retinues to Kosovo to meet the Turkish army.\" Though              Knez Lazar called all his vassals, only some came, some were late,              and some never started.\nLazar              wished to delay the battle, hoping more reinforcements would arrive,              but on July 15 (28), 1389 the Turks surprised the Serbs with an unexpected              attack. (The date discrepancy is due to the acceptance of the Gregorian              calendar by the Serbs later than Europe). The Serbs led an army of              Bulgarians, Bosnians, Skepitars of Albania, with men from Hungry,              Wallachia and Poland. It appeared that in the beginning, the Turks              with an array of their vassals, were losing. In truth, history knows              little or nothing of the facts. It appears that the battle was one              of courage rather than tactics.\n\"It              was not a fight to the bitter end.\" Before the battle started,              it was lost, for the Serbs fearing treachery, lost courage. \"Victory              is never won by those who feel they are going to lose.\" \"All              the legends agree in suggesting that the Issue of the battle was determined              by treason. A certain Vuk Brankovitch Is represented as the Serbian              Judas who led his forces over to the enemy at the crucial moment.\" However, the treachery of Vuk Brankovic is not a proven historical              fact. \"Treachery is always the excuse of the vanquished, for              it assuages the bitterness of defeat.\"\nBeyond              excuses and legend, both leaders, Knez Lazar and Sultan Amurath were              killed during the battle. We know nothing historically of how either              leader died. It is said that Murad was killed by a false deserter,              and that dying he had Knez Lazar brought before him and beheaded.              However, that is only legend. At the reports of Murads death the western              world thought that Serbia had won, but his death did not affect the              course of the battle except that \"It considerably increased the              severity of Bayazids' treatment of his Serbian captives.\" This              led to the battle's major political importance, for Bayazid, Murad's              heir, killed most of the Serbian princes and nobles either in battle,              beheaded them immediately after it, as revenge for his father's death.\nThe              two new rulers, Bayazid of the Ottoman's and Stephan Lazarovitch of              the Serbs, made peace. The truce of peace which followed \". .              . established the inferior position of the Serbians.\" \"The              terms of the treaty then agreed to were very moderate. Instead of              being incorporated In the Ottoman Empire . . . Serbia was to be an              autonomous state under vassalage to the Ottoman Empire . . . \" It is known that this liberal peace came from the \"enforced\" marriage of Stephan's sister Oliva to Bayazid.\nAfter              the battle of Kosovo the Serbs did not deceive themselves, It was              the death-knell to independence. It destroyed all that was done in              the way of Statehood and freedoms since the eleventh century and Nemanja.              Even further destruction came in 1459 when Serbia was incorporated              into the Ottoman Empire proper. After that time Serbia was no longer              a true state.\n\"The              battle of Kosovo, one of the most decisive moments in the century-long              struggle of the Serbs against the Turks, quickly became the subject              of legend.\" The poets, bards or minstrels of Serbia were touched              to their poetic souls, and wrote the legend of Kosovo. They were affected              because there was a foreigner, a conqueror, an occupier in their land.              The legends, or poems are probably the most important effect, political              or cultural that the battle at Kosovo Polje had. They are important              because they helped the Serbs to remember the battle and what their              past was. The greatness of the legends or poems lies in their honesty.              The guslari (minstrels) did not hide the weaknesses which led to the              defeat, but glorified them. \"...what amazes one is the curious              fact that the very folk songs that glorify Saint Lazar and lament              Kosova reveal a frank and true picture of the events and prove how              little warrant there is for the legend.\"\nThe              legends were needed, however, to help maintain the culture of the              Serbs. The Turkish victory cut off and destroyed the work of Serbia's              leaders and founders, leaving the people alienated from their culture.              To maintain a remnant of their culture, the guslari sung their songs              of defeat and of God's will to the people. As there are few cultural              or artistic expressions as powerful as the guslari, they had a great              impact on their time. In the poems are all the social relationships,              portrayed and examined, the culture idealized. All that was good remembered,              the bad forgotten. For cultural reasons these legends were essential.              If not for the legends, the Serbian people might have forgotten their              past and adapted Turkish life styles. The epic poems prevented their              forgetting the past, as the poems taught in the schools, filled the              minds of the people with heroes, and a heritage. Their religion also              glorified in the epics also needed a tool for survival, and the legends              complied. Once again the legends helped the people remember their              religion, and to be proud of the heritage they possessed.\nIn              the legends themselves are suggestions \". . . for a future struggle              against the Turks . . . \" This led to the peoples hope for a              future, thus for survival. The poems glorify the defeat as an act              of God. They assuage the bitterness of defeat by using scapegoats,              and traitors. In addition they bring to mind the \"good old days\" of heroes and heroines fighting for their country, king, and Christianity.\nThese              epics \"helped the Christian peasant to preserve his ethnic individuality              and his faith.\" The memories are still strong, \". . . and              in token of mourning for that great national calamity (the Watterloo              of the Serbian Empire) the Montenegrins still wear a black band on              their caps . . . Murad's heart is still preserved on the spot where              he died; Lazar's shroud is still treasured by the Hungarian Serbs              in the monastery of Vrdnik; and in many a lonely village the minstrel              sings to the sound of the gusle the melancholy legend of Kosova.\" It Is these memories which prevented the Serbs from self-pity, but              steeled them against submission. When they needed support most the              epics which \". . . so majestically touched on the defeated Serbian              nation . . . \" gave them the strength to withstand the slavery              and look toward freedom. Even today, years later, upon the rise of              modern Serbian nationalism Kosovo became the symbol for their national              Identity.\nThe              quality of the epics can also be spoken of. \"In their description              of the events, especially where the poets narrated the terrible tortures              during battle and afterwards, they bring to mind the Italian poet              Dante's Divine Comedy which also dates between the thirteenth and              fourteenth centuries.\" The Divine Comedy Is considered one of              the Western world's greatest classics. It was also said of the poems              that they were as good as, If not better than any Greek or Latin poems              ever written. This was said by Jurag Sisgoric (1487) in his work De              Situ Illyriae et civitate Sibenici.\nThese              legends and poems held the Serbian people together in their memories              of pride and honor. The poems can be said to be one of the major causes              for Serbia's continued cultural and religious survival. However, the              battle of Kosovo also had direct negative effects on the Serbian people.              There was a terrible set back of their language, civilization, nationality,              religion and of all they held dear. This great catastrophe tested              Serbian moral, religious, and physical strength.\nAfter              the battle of Kosovo the Turks were tolerant of religion except when              it went into political spheres or sided with rebels. Since there were              rebellions and struggles and since the church worked with the rebellious              people, she also suffered the wrath of the Turks. Of the 3,000 different              Church institutions half were destroyed or desecrated by the nineteenth              century.\nDespite              these persecutions the Serbian faith in their national religion made              it impossible for Islam to take over as it had in Bosnia, Albania,              Macedonia and Bulgaria. In Serbia the Turks ruled but could not destroy              its national identity.\nThough              under difficult conditions Stephan Lazarovitch gathered together the              intelligencia of Serbia to a monastery at Velika Morava, called Resava.              In this monastery scribes and translators worked, and frescos covered              the walls. Between Knez Lazar and his son the Moravska school of art              and studies developed in the Velika Morava area.\nOther              contributions to the culture of Serbia after Kosovo mainly related              to the battle, commemorating it, and its heroes, were: Konstantin              Mihajiovic wrote a biography of Stephan Lazarovic; and the nuns Jefinije              and Grigorije who made a tapestry dedicated to the death of Knez Lazar,              which is an object of great cultural importance to medieval art in              general.\nAfter              Kosovo, Serbian books were printed at Gorazde, Gracanica, Rujio, Milesvo,              Beograde and Skadar. The Turks persecuted and destroyed these publishers              because they served the Serbian national purpose. The situation after              the battle was so bad for the people, that in a letter from a Dubrovnik              family to Serbian friends, the Serbians were invited to go to Dubrovnik, \"If they could not support themselves.\"\nDespite              the persecutions and bad economic conditions, the Serbian people always              had a feeling of optimism, remembering past glories and looking to              future greatness. They survived five centuries of alien subjugation.              During those five centuries neither culture advanced, both Serbs and              Turks remained in a pocket of Feudal, Medieval life, till the nineteenth              century. This stagnated culture, the culture of the Serbs held down,              from flourishing as it had, sprang back to life when it regained its              freedom. Although the Serbs missed both renaissance and enlightenment,              due to the Turkish occupation, they rapidly advanced, once freed,              due to the heritage which they so zealously protected through some              five centuries.\nThey              are advancing because of their spirit and hopes. They are advancing              because of their pride and convictions. They are advancing because              they remember, the humiliation of their fathers. Their memory is long,              but vital and strong. It is this memory of the battle of Kosovo that              kept the Serbian culture alive.\nThe              Battle of Kosovo was a military loss to the Serbs. They lost country,              language, and hopes. Yet from this loss came the epic poems of Serbia,              the stories of their past. I feel that this loss of a battle enabled              the Serbs to win the war . . . of cultural survival.\nEND\nTraditional Commemoration at the site of the Battle,              Gazimestan tower\nDimitrije              Djordjevic\nThe Role of St. Vitus' Day\nin Modern Serbian\nNiti              cemo se pokoriti, niti ukloniti!\n(We shall neither submit, nor yield!)\nIn              1887, on the occasion of the celebration of Vidovdan (Saint Vitus'              Day) in the Serbian Monastery of Ravanica, Nikanor, the bishop of              Pakrac, addressed his flock with these words: \"I shall not make              a long sermon. It is enough to tell you: Brethren, today is Vidovdan!\"\nFor              Serbs, scattered over the central, northern, and western Balkans,              living in 2 independent Serbian states born through revolutions and              wars during the 19th century, as well as subjected to the Ottoman              and Habsburg rule, Vidovdan embodied their \"historical memory.\" It became synonymous for the 1389 Battle of Kosovo, which took place              on that day, and which determined the Serbian people's collective              and individual destiny. Vidovdan was imbedded in the Serbian ethnic              and national self-awareness. It became the incentive for survival,              the inspiration in the struggle for personal and national liberation.              The myth and legend of Kosovo and Vidovdan were transmitted to posterity              by the popular epic poetry, by the Serbian Orthodox Church, by intellectuals              and historians, as well as by national and political leaders in modern              times. Generations of Serbs and historians divided the national past              into 2 periods: before and after the Kosovo Battle. Later, following              the birth and ascendancy of the modern Serbian state in the 19th and              20th centuries, 3 kinds of traditions emerged: the old cult of the              Kosovo Battle, the reverence for the 1804-1815 uprisings, and the              commemoration of the 1912-1918 wars. The first marked the defeat of              the medieval Serbian state, the second announced the beginning and              the third the victory of the reborn state.\nAmong              Serbian national holidays, Vidovdan occupied a place of particular              importance. It symbolized the death and resurrection, the despair              and hope, and the end of an epoch and the beginning of a new era.              During the Ottoman rule, it offered a fatherland even before it was              organized. It was woven in the texture of modern Serbian nationalism              in recent times. In 1889, in agreement with religious authorities,              the Serbian government confirmed Vidovdan as the day consecrated to              all those who sacrificed their lives for the faith and the fatherland.              Intentionally, or by historical coincidence, on Vidovdan 1876 the              war against the Ottomans was declared, the 1881 Secret Convention              with Austria-Hungary was signed, the 1914 Sarajevo assassination took              place, the 1921 Yugoslav Constitution was proclaimed, and the 1948              Resolution of the Cominform was declared. Until the end of World War              II, Vidovdan marked the end of the school year when awards were bestowed              upon the best students.\nReference              to the past characterized the development of modern nationalism in              Europe during the \"age of national renaissance\" after 1815.              In the search for the \"national soul\" the celebration of the days of fallen heroes was to confirm the national identity and              unity. In the study of the cult of St. Vitus' Day among the Serbs              my esteemed colleague and old friend, Professor Ekmecic from Sarajevo,              compared this observance with the \"Fete de la Federation\" inaugurated in 1790 in France as a token of the \"united and indivisible              nation,\" practically as in the same manner as Bastille Day or              the \"Totenfest\" introduced by Wilhelm III in Prussia. The              celebration of Vidovdan among the Serbs expressed, in general terms,              similar trends of modern nationalism. But, at the same time, there              was 1 difference. Days celebrating fallen heroes were in Europe decreed              from above, by rulers or governments. Vidovdan truly emerged among              the Serbs from the grassroots, from the illiterate village community.              Until officially celebrated, it already existed in the people's minds,              in oral history, refreshed and adapted in epic ballads as a part of              the folk tradition. This tradition was spread by Serbian migrations              over the regions in which they settled during the Ottoman period.              At the beginning, it contributed to the feelings of ethnic unity of              the Serbs and, later, to their affiliation with their modern nation.\nFrom              the day of their conversion to Christianity the South Slavs celebrated              St. Vitus' Day, dedicated to an Italian saint from Lucania. The conservative              peasant community for centuries preserved customs related to the pagan              god Svevid or Vid, the Slavic name for St. Vitus. According to Milan              Milicevic, in the 1880's peasant girls would soak the herb \"vidovica\" in water and wash their faces with it. However, the Battle of Kosovo,              which took place on the saint's day, gave another meaning to it. According              to peasants's belief, the rivers will turn red on Vidovdan, colored              by the blood of fallen heroes at Kosovo. After the battle, Kraljevic              Marko fell asleep to wake up on the day when Kosovo will be avenged.              In Montenegro women wore black scarves around their heads and the              men's caps were embroidered with black for mourning the Vidovdan Kosovo              Battle. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Serbian Church marked              Vidovdan with red letters in religious calendars.\nSeeded              in the people's mind through being chanted by peasant bards, whose              poems Vuk Karadzic collected, the Vidovdan message was further modified              and adapted to contemporary needs of the modern epoch. Historians              and intellectuals referred to the cult of Vidovdan in transforming              the instinctive popular national feelings into modern, mass nationalism.              Supported by the Church, the leaders of the gradually developing Serbian              statehood in the 19th century offered their support to the Vidovdan              legacy.\nAlthough              Karadjordje appeared in the popular mind as the avenger of Kosovo,              the leadership of the 1804 Serbian uprising extolled the medieval              state tradition and the cult of Stefan, the First Crowned King. It              symbolized the ascendancy of statehood, while Kosovo meant its collapse.              The tragic defeat suffered in 1813 invigorated the memory of the sacrifice              of 2 central figures of the Vidovdan myth: the martyrdom of Prince              Lazar and the heroic regicide of Milos Obilic. During the reign of              the Obrenovici (1815-1842), the accent was placed on the 1815 uprising,              while the cult of the previous 1804-1813 movement was deliberately              neglected. Along with the further consolidation and organization of              the Serbian state, as well as through the extension of the Serbian              national program, the legacy of Emperor Dusan the Mighty was brought              into focus. Garasanin's Nacertanije, written in 1844, quoted the crucial              effects of the Kosovo Battle, but found the country's future in the              restoration of the pre-Kosovo Serbian state tradition. Both Serbian              dynasties, the Obrenovici and Karadjordjevici, presented themselves              as heirs and successors of medieval rulers. The later organized political              parties, during the last decades of the century, modified the Vidovdan              message according to their ideological and political polarizations.              The conservatives remembered Prince Lazar's oath on the eve of Vidovdan,              which called for unity. Domestic political dissent caused, according              to them, the 1389 defeat. On the contrary, the liberals referred to              the democratic resistance of the people, to the message of the Mother              Jugovic and the servant Goluban, and the popular struggle for freedom.\nWhatever              the pragmatic approach to the Kosovo message might be, Vidovdan continued              to be commemorated by the public at large. As a writer from Vojvodina              described its influence, \"... the cult of Kosovo heroes was presented              to children at Christmas, at the slava, and was quoted in proverbs              and curses.\"\nThe              Church took the leading role in organizing Vidovdan commemorations              during the first decades of the century. Ecclesiastical calendars              presented Vidovdan as the \"Emperor Lazar's Day,\" mentioning              St. Vitus only additionally. Vidovdan was dedicated to the day of \"national grievance and repentance.\" Vidovdan was considered              in general as the day of national mourning. Later on, during the last              decades of the century, the churches were on Vidovdan draped in black,              black flags were put out on houses, national standards were at half-mast,              and invitations for the commemoration were printed with black margins.\nThe              cult of Vidovdan blossomed during the period of romanticism in the              1850's and 1860's. Formed in 1847, the Society of Serbian Youth chose              Vidovdan for the founding day when \"our heroic forefathers sacrificed              themselves for freedom.\" A founding member made the inflammatory              appeal: \"Do we will, can we, do we dare to go to Kosovo!\" Historians of the romanticist school idealized the past. Portraits              of Kosovo warriors were reproduced and displayed in peasant and urban              homes. Vidovdan became the major topic in literature, dramatic arts,              and paintings. Student associations glorified the sacrifice of their              ancestors, which culminated in the national euphoria of the Omladina              in the 1870's.\nWhile              the Church, the youth, and the nationalistic public were commemorating              Vidovdan, the state authorities were forced to take a cautious attitude.              Until 1878, Serbia was in a vassal relationship with the Ottoman Empire.              The international status of Serbia was fragile, which was manifested              during the Crimean War, national upheavals during the 1860's, and              the eruption of the Eastern Crisis in 1875. Until 1867, Turkish nizams              were still patrolling the streets of Belgrade, while the pasha was              residing in the city's fortress. Serbian governments were involved              in underground revolutionary activities aiming toward the liberation              and unification of Serbs then under Habsburg and Ottoman rule. However,              to openly and officially organize celebrations and commemorations              of a battle in which the Serbs fought the Turks and 1 of their knights              assassinated the sultan would be an affront to the Ottoman suzerain.              The first public celebration of Vidovdan took place in the Beograd              reading room in 1847. But when in 1851 state officials participated              in the organization of Vidovdan festivities, the Ottomans protested              vehemently and the Serbian government had to fire the incriminated              officials. In 1865, when invited to write the text for the Serbian              national anthem, the poet Jovan Jovanovic-Zmaj from Novi Sad was explicitly              warned from Belgrade not to mention Vidovdan, in regard to the Turkish              reaction. With the consolidation of the Serbian international position              and the 1878 recognized independence, the situation improved, although              the constant threat of Ottoman reactions was present until the 20th              century. In 1882, when Serbia was proclaimed a kingdom, King Milan              was named \"The First Crowned King After Kosovo.\" In that              moment references to the past were mainly used for domestic political              purposes.\nDuring              the 19th century, Vidovdan was com-memorated among Serbs in the Habsburg              and Ottoman Empires, under the watchful eye of the respective authorities,              sensitive to the outburst of Serbian national feelings. The Vidovdan              cult was the strongest in Vojvodina, due to the advanced Serbian community              and the role which the Church played in it. Especially after the revolutionary              days of 1848, Vidovdan was remembered at church gatherings, popular              fairs, and youth festivals as a token of national solidarity, pride,              and self-confidence. From 1869 the Orthodox calendars in Bosnia dedicated              Vidovdan as the day of \"Emperor Lazar, Patriarch Yephremos, and              the Martyr Vitus.\" When the 1875 uprising started in Bosnia and              Herzegovina, the call addressed to peasants to join the movement quoted              almost verbatim Prince Lazar's oath on the eve of Vidovdan 1389.\nVidovdan              found its place in the formative stage of the Yugoslav movement in              Croatia. In 1840 the day was celebrated by students of the Zagreb              seminary. Danica Ilirska, the journal of the Illyrian movement, published              Kosovo epic poems. Its leader, Ljudevit Gaj, wrote in 1853 a series              of essays on Vidovdan. On the occasion of the 500th anniversary of              the Kosovo Battle in 1889 a solemn session of the Yugoslav Academy              of Sciences and Arts was held in Zagreb, with speeches by the 2 most              prominent Croatian scholars:Franjo Racki and Toma Maretic. At the              beginning of the 20th century, the world-famous Croatian sculptor              Ivan Mestrovic designed the \"Vidovdanski Hram\" (St. Vitus              Temple). It was never realized, although the most important figures from the Kosovo epic were already made in marble in 1908. Mestrovic's              artistic vision was the greatest glorification of Vidovdan ever attempted.\nA contemporary              Serb painting by Zoran Pavlovic\nThe              memory of Vidovdan was kept alive among the Serbs in the Ottoman Empire.              The Orthodox seminary in Prizren, founded in 1871, became the nursery              of the Vidovdan cult. The students association, \"Rastko,\" named after St. Sava's lay name, commemorated Vidovdan in order to              promote national propaganda, and was exposed to the constant pressure              of the Ottoman-Albanian hostile environment.\nThe              outburst of Serbian national dynamism at the dawn of the 20th century              further enlivened the cult of Vidovdan. To \"avenge Kosovo\" became the slogan of the day. Among the Serbian and Montenegrin war              aims in the 1912 war, the priority was to reconquer and liberate Kosovo.              As a result, the campaign had the character of a holy war. After the              victory, students and citizens visited the Kosovo monasteries. Visits              were scheduled mainly on Vidovdan to attend the solemn service in              Gracanica. It was there in 1914 that a group of students from Sarajevo              learned the news of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. There is              no doubt that Gavrilo Princip, planning the regicide, was greatly              influenced by the aura of deity which the Bosnian nationalistic youth              assigned to Milos Obilic, as well as by Vidovdan, the day when the              Austrian crown prince visited the Bosnian capital.\nThe              Vidovdan cult reappeared again during World War I, when the Serbian              army retreated to Kosovo, on its exodus to the Adriatic shores. In              that dramatic moment the flamboyant Vojvoda Misic proposed a counter-offensive              from Kosovo, imbued with the same Vidovdan alternative to win or to              perish.\nVidovdan              was celebrated in British schools during the war. The 3rd detachment              of volunteers from the United States embroidered on their flag \"Vidovdanski              borci iz Amerike,\" and a group of volunteers on the Salonika              front took the name \"Vidovdanski borci.\"\nDuring              the century from 1889 until 1989, celebrations of centenaries of the              Kosovo Battle mirrored the spirit of the people and the needs of the              times in which they lived. In 1889, on the occasion of the 500th anniversary              commemoration, Serbia was facing the crisis caused by the domestic              struggle for constitutionalism and parliamentarism, the victory of              liberalism enacted by the 1888 Constitution, followed by the abdication              of King Milan and the succession to the throne of his minor son, Alexander.              The popular and official celebration of Vidovdan 1889 had, besides              the national cause, the desire to consolidate the shaken dynasty and              to strengthen the new liberal regime. On Vidovdan, June 15th (by the              old calendar) a solemn requiem to the Kosovo warriors was held in              Krusevac, the ancient capital of Prince Lazar, and the foundation              of the monument dedicated to the Kosovo martyrs was laid. In the following              days the young King Alexander was anointed in the Zica Monastery as \"the first anointed Serbian king after Kosovo.\" The anniversary              was celebrated in Montenegro, Vojvodina, and other parts where Serbs              Iived.\nIn              1939, 50 years later, the 550th anniversary of Vidovdan was commemorated              in the atmosphere of the coming crisis and under the stormy clouds              which announced to Europe the outbreak of World War II. Requiems of              Vidovdan in Gracanica, both Monasteries of Ravanica in Resava and              Srem, as well as the 2 Lazarica Churches in Krusevac and Dalmatia,              were held in the presence of the representatives of the government              and the army, the military, and national societies. They delivered              the message to the expected invader: \"Niti cemo se pokoriti,              niti ukloniti!\" (We shall neither submit, nor yield!).\nThe              Serbian people, faithful to their historical legacy, paid dearly for              this commitment during the World War II. Under the new Communist regime              imposed after the end of the war, public and official commemorations              of Vidovdan were not allowed, and the Vidovdan memory was intentionally              swept under the carpet. The only organization which kept it alive              for more than 40 years was the Serbian Orthodox Church. However, the              destruction of the historical legacy proved to be an illusion. The              national revival of the Serbs, subjected to an artificial \"national              symmetry\" in the Yugoslav multinational state, which divided them and deprived them of authority over their own territory, erupted              like a volcano in recent years. The Vidovdan message became resurrected              as a cornerstone in Serbian history. As happened in centuries past,              the cults of St. Sava and Kosovo became again the cement to unify              the nation in the struggle for national and human rights. On the eve              of Vidovdan 1989 the splendid, new Church of Saint Sava was consecrated              in Belgrade, and the next day over one-and-a-half million Serbs from              all over the country attended the 600 years requiem to the Kosovo              martyrs in Gracanica, as well as the official ceremony in Gazimestan,              where the 1389 Battle took place. Popular gatherings in Romanija (Bosnia)              and Knin (Croatia) followed. Scholarly symposia in Belgrade, Sarajevo,              and other places dealt with the historical importance of the 1389              Battle for the Serbs, Yugoslavs, the Balkans, and Europe.\nThe              historical heritage has a double meaning: that of fiction and that              of reality. It mirrors the past and projects the future. The Vidovdan              message was and is for the Serbs, wherever they live, a token of their              past and present destinies.\nThe Eulogy of              Nun Euphemia to Prince Lazar - embroydery, beg. 15th c.\nMuseum of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade",

This Serbian culture was retarded for five centuries, after the Serbian defeat on the plain of Kosovo.\nFrom a culture that led Europe and the Balkans during the Medieval period, the Serbian culture degenerated and stagnated, to the point that when it regained its freedom it had centuries to recover. The Turkish victory at Kosovo, was not as much political as it was cultural. 'Turkish historians lay more stress on the Battle of Maritza eighteen years before, which they call Serb Sindin (Serbian defeat).' The military destiny of Serbia was sealed at Maritza. Contemporary chroniclers, without the benefit of hindsight, felt that Kosovo was only one of a series of bloody engagements, leading to the collapse of the Serbian kingdom.\nWhat then is the importance of the Battle of Kosovo? It was a cultural defeat, a religious defeat. It became the symbol of Turkish power and Serbian defeat, not to be forgotten . . . revenge was always over the horizon. The grand Serbian culture, which flourished under Tzar's Dushan and Milutin, was only a memory, after Serbia's knights, armies and hopes died at the field of Kosovo.\n'The State was destroyed, but underneath was born from pain and from battle a strong people.' It was this strong people, that clung to their own culture, or a remnant of it against time and the Turks. The Battle at Kosovo Polje is one of the focal points of their memories, and as such played a vital role in the Serbian culture.\nThe binding force in Serbian Culture is its national religion. When in 1190 Nemanja set up a state, from the chaos of the third crusade, the people's religion was not a national concern. His son, now known as St. Sava, brought the Eastern Orthodox Church to Serbia, and set up an oriental culture, leaning toward Byzantium. St. Sava also separated the church from Byzantine rule, and placed the church establishment in the service of the nation. This was the first national church, untied to either Greek Orthodox or Roman dictates. This policy of separation was continued through Tzar Dushan's reign (1331-1355) when he planned and executed all possible activities halting the influence of the Roman church in his state.\nThis national religion needed a base, or platform to be effective. The monastery was 'chosen' for this purpose. In fact by 1430 there were 3,000 monasteries and churches in Serbia. These institutions were the basic educational and cultural establishments of their day. An example of the high culture prevalent in the monasteries at the end of the thirteenth century, Queen Jelena founded a type of 'womans' home keeping school' at Brnjeval near today's Kosovska Mitrovica. The building and maintaining of monasteries and church institutions are shown in many of the ballads from the period, 'The Building of Ravanitsa' (a monastery) is one example. This poem speaks of the construction of a church institution as a duty of the Tzar.\nIn the Serbian society literacy was limited to a narrow circle, mainly religious in charracter. However, there are proofs that literacy often passed the bounds of the religion sector. An example of the literature of the time is a biography of St. Sava written by Monk Teodisije in the thirteenth through fourteenth centuries. The monasteries besides being centers of education and literature were centers of art.\nIn these monasteries were created beautiful frescos, paintings, tapestries and handicrafts. The art of Serbia of the thirteenth century is considered independent and 'convincingly superior' to the art of Byzantium. 'On the vast territory of Dusan's empire there were a number of smaller provincial centers of art . . . in spite of their local charracter, the works produced there had two great assets; they were numerous and of high technical accomplishment,' The architecture of the monasteries also represents a special achievement for its time.\nOther cultural achievements of the Serbs lie in the field of politics and government. Militarily the Serbs had been on the rise continually and under Tzar Dushan they controlled Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania and parts of Greece. At the time of his death, Tzar Dushan was planning to resist the Turks and attack Constantinople. Under Tzars Milutin through Dushan, Serbia was moving toward its real mission as a nation with wealth and power. The advances were not only in military spheres. Tzar Dushan also gave to the Serbs a law which has importance to the Serbs and to Southern Slave in general. This law, the Zakonk, was born of Byzantine and other prevalent laws of the time, and can be said to be a picture of the Serbian social structure of justice based on law.\nAfter Dushan's death the military strength of the autocracy decreased. In 1377 Knez Lazar (ruler of Serbia) was forced to accept the crowning of Tvrtka I at Milesevo (St. Sava's grave) making him (Tvrtka I) king of Bosnia, with rights over Serbia. The clash with the Turks found the Serbs at the teak of their national feeling and culture.\nWhen fourteenth century Serbia achieved its political peak most European countries were second-rate powers. Individual nation states were only evolving in Europe at the time when Serbia's star was already falling. The 'countries' of Europe were still subservient to the church of Rome, until the seventeenth century, while Serbia developed a national church in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This superior culture faced the Ottoman Turks. This was a clash of not only military strength, but of faiths and ways of life.\nThough the major motivating forces were political, cultural and religious feelings and motives also played a part in the battle of Kosovo. 'The Turkish system of occupying conquered countries with military colonies and carrying off the original inhabitants, excited a great national opposition in the year 1389.' This policy which would destroy the culture and religion of Serbia as well as the state, enraged the people. They felt that 'the Ottomans were alien barbarians with a lesser civilization and a religion totally different from that of the conquered.' Both the Turks and Serbs were motivated by religious Ideals; the Turks for Islam, and the Serbs for Christianity.\nBarring other motives, both parties were politically opposed. The conflict had begun with small marauding raids the Turks pushed across the Dardanelles. When they established a foothold in the Balkans the conflict '. . . progressed too more serious . . . and finally to a full scale campaign.'\nIt is felt that Tzar Dushan might have held back the Turks, but at his death his empire fragmented. Lacking a common culture or political tradition the empire collapsed, leaving. Its remnants open to Turkish encroachment.\n'Of course the great task for the Serbian statesman of that time was, how to stem the further progress of the Ottoman Turks and drive them back to Asia.' Knez Lazar as elected chief of Serbia tried to unify tie country and stop the Turks. 'While Prince Lazar was Infusing fresh vigor into the Serbian State, the danger from the Turks was becoming increasingly pressing.' Knez Lazar began to form a Christian league against the Turks. It was revealed to Sultan Murad, who promptly invaded Bulgaria and Serbia to destroy the Christian league. The political desires of the two nations were diametrically opposed; the Turks wanted Serbian lands, and the Serbs survival.\nThe final military struggle, the clash at Kosovo, was a conflict of both empires, economic systems, religions and hopes. Bulgaria was subdued first and then in 1339 Amurath (Murad I) marched against Knez Lazar, ruler of Serbia. 'A great assault on Serbia was organized by the Sultan Murad I . . . he penetrated to the field of Kosovo.' 'In great haste he (Lazar) had to summon his noblemen to hurry with their retinues to Kosovo to meet the Turkish army.' Though Knez Lazar called all his vassals, only some came, some were late, and some never started.\nLazar wished to delay the battle, hoping more reinforcements would arrive, but on July 15 (28), 1389 the Turks surprised the Serbs with an unexpected attack. (The date discrepancy is due to the acceptance of the Gregorian calendar by the Serbs later than Europe). The Serbs led an army of Bulgarians, Bosnians, Skepitars of Albania, with men from Hungry, Wallachia and Poland. It appeared that in the beginning, the Turks with an array of their vassals, were losing. In truth, history knows little or nothing of the facts. It appears that the battle was one of courage rather than tactics.\n'It was not a fight to the bitter end.' Before the battle started, it was lost, for the Serbs fearing treachery, lost courage. 'Victory is never won by those who feel they are going to lose.' 'All the legends agree in suggesting that the Issue of the battle was determined by treason. A certain Vuk Brankovitch Is represented as the Serbian Judas who led his forces over to the enemy at the crucial moment.' However, the treachery of Vuk Brankovic is not a proven historical fact. 'Treachery is always the excuse of the vanquished, for it assuages the bitterness of defeat.'\nBeyond excuses and legend, both leaders, Knez Lazar and Sultan Amurath were killed during the battle. We know nothing historically of how either leader died. It is said that Murad was killed by a false deserter, and that dying he had Knez Lazar brought before him and beheaded. However, that is only legend. At the reports of Murads death the western world thought that Serbia had won, but his death did not affect the course of the battle except that 'It considerably increased the severity of Bayazids' treatment of his Serbian captives.' This led to the battle's major political importance, for Bayazid, Murad's heir, killed most of the Serbian princes and nobles either in battle, beheaded them immediately after it, as revenge for his father's death.\nThe two new rulers, Bayazid of the Ottoman's and Stephan Lazarovitch of the Serbs, made peace. The truce of peace which followed '. . . established the inferior position of the Serbians.' 'The terms of the treaty then agreed to were very moderate. Instead of being incorporated In the Ottoman Empire . . . Serbia was to be an autonomous state under vassalage to the Ottoman Empire . . . ' It is known that this liberal peace came from the 'enforced' marriage of Stephan's sister Oliva to Bayazid.\nAfter the battle of Kosovo the Serbs did not deceive themselves, It was the death-knell to independence. It destroyed all that was done in the way of Statehood and freedoms since the eleventh century and Nemanja. Even further destruction came in 1459 when Serbia was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire proper. After that time Serbia was no longer a true state.\n'The battle of Kosovo, one of the most decisive moments in the century-long struggle of the Serbs against the Turks, quickly became the subject of legend.' The poets, bards or minstrels of Serbia were touched to their poetic souls, and wrote the legend of Kosovo. They were affected because there was a foreigner, a conqueror, an occupier in their land. The legends, or poems are probably the most important effect, political or cultural that the battle at Kosovo Polje had. They are important because they helped the Serbs to remember the battle and what their past was. The greatness of the legends or poems lies in their honesty. The guslari (minstrels) did not hide the weaknesses which led to the defeat, but glorified them. '...what amazes one is the curious fact that the very folk songs that glorify Saint Lazar and lament Kosova reveal a frank and true picture of the events and prove how little warrant there is for the legend.'\nThe legends were needed, however, to help maintain the culture of the Serbs. The Turkish victory cut off and destroyed the work of Serbia's leaders and founders, leaving the people alienated from their culture. To maintain a remnant of their culture, the guslari sung their songs of defeat and of God's will to the people. As there are few cultural or artistic expressions as powerful as the guslari, they had a great impact on their time. In the poems are all the social relationships, portrayed and examined, the culture idealized. All that was good remembered, the bad forgotten. For cultural reasons these legends were essential. If not for the legends, the Serbian people might have forgotten their past and adapted Turkish life styles. The epic poems prevented their forgetting the past, as the poems taught in the schools, filled the minds of the people with heroes, and a heritage. Their religion also glorified in the epics also needed a tool for survival, and the legends complied. Once again the legends helped the people remember their religion, and to be proud of the heritage they possessed.\nIn the legends themselves are suggestions '. . . for a future struggle against the Turks . . . ' This led to the peoples hope for a future, thus for survival. The poems glorify the defeat as an act of God. They assuage the bitterness of defeat by using scapegoats, and traitors. In addition they bring to mind the 'good old days' of heroes and heroines fighting for their country, king, and Christianity.\nThese epics 'helped the Christian peasant to preserve his ethnic individuality and his faith.' The memories are still strong, '. . . and in token of mourning for that great national calamity (the Watterloo of the Serbian Empire) the Montenegrins still wear a black band on their caps . . . Murad's heart is still preserved on the spot where he died; Lazar's shroud is still treasured by the Hungarian Serbs in the monastery of Vrdnik; and in many a lonely village the minstrel sings to the sound of the gusle the melancholy legend of Kosova.' It Is these memories which prevented the Serbs from self-pity, but steeled them against submission. When they needed support most the epics which '. . . so majestically touched on the defeated Serbian nation . . . ' gave them the strength to withstand the slavery and look toward freedom. Even today, years later, upon the rise of modern Serbian nationalism Kosovo became the symbol for their national Identity.\nThe quality of the epics can also be spoken of. 'In their description of the events, especially where the poets narrated the terrible tortures during battle and afterwards, they bring to mind the Italian poet Dante's Divine Comedy which also dates between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.' The Divine Comedy Is considered one of the Western world's greatest classics. It was also said of the poems that they were as good as, If not better than any Greek or Latin poems ever written. This was said by Jurag Sisgoric (1487) in his work De Situ Illyriae et civitate Sibenici.\nThese legends and poems held the Serbian people together in their memories of pride and honor. The poems can be said to be one of the major causes for Serbia's continued cultural and religious survival. However, the battle of Kosovo also had direct negative effects on the Serbian people. There was a terrible set back of their language, civilization, nationality, religion and of all they held dear. This great catastrophe tested Serbian moral, religious, and physical strength.\nAfter the battle of Kosovo the Turks were tolerant of religion except when it went into political spheres or sided with rebels. Since there were rebellions and struggles and since the church worked with the rebellious people, she also suffered the wrath of the Turks. Of the 3,000 different Church institutions half were destroyed or desecrated by the nineteenth century.\nDespite these persecutions the Serbian faith in their national religion made it impossible for Islam to take over as it had in Bosnia, Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria. In Serbia the Turks ruled but could not destroy its national identity.\nThough under difficult conditions Stephan Lazarovitch gathered together the intelligencia of Serbia to a monastery at Velika Morava, called Resava. In this monastery scribes and translators worked, and frescos covered the walls. Between Knez Lazar and his son the Moravska school of art and studies developed in the Velika Morava area.\nOther contributions to the culture of Serbia after Kosovo mainly related to the battle, commemorating it, and its heroes, were: Konstantin Mihajiovic wrote a biography of Stephan Lazarovic; and the nuns Jefinije and Grigorije who made a tapestry dedicated to the death of Knez Lazar, which is an object of great cultural importance to medieval art in general.\nAfter Kosovo, Serbian books were printed at Gorazde, Gracanica, Rujio, Milesvo, Beograde and Skadar. The Turks persecuted and destroyed these publishers because they served the Serbian national purpose. The situation after the battle was so bad for the people, that in a letter from a Dubrovnik family to Serbian friends, the Serbians were invited to go to Dubrovnik, 'If they could not support themselves.'\nDespite the persecutions and bad economic conditions, the Serbian people always had a feeling of optimism, remembering past glories and looking to future greatness. They survived five centuries of alien subjugation. During those five centuries neither culture advanced, both Serbs and Turks remained in a pocket of Feudal, Medieval life, till the nineteenth century. This stagnated culture, the culture of the Serbs held down, from flourishing as it had, sprang back to life when it regained its freedom. Although the Serbs missed both renaissance and enlightenment, due to the Turkish occupation, they rapidly advanced, once freed, due to the heritage which they so zealously protected through some five centuries.\nThey are advancing because of their spirit and hopes. They are advancing because of their pride and convictions. They are advancing because they remember, the humiliation of their fathers. Their memory is long, but vital and strong. It is this memory of the battle of Kosovo that kept the Serbian culture alive.\nThe Battle of Kosovo was a military loss to the Serbs. They lost country, language, and hopes. Yet from this loss came the epic poems of Serbia, the stories of their past. I feel that this loss of a battle enabled the Serbs to win the war . . . of cultural survival.\n<a href=\" http://books.google.com/books?id=mrh0fdDeoY0C&pg=RA1-PA802&dq=serviens&ei=4njbSfX2Io6gMt7rocsE&hl=fr&output=html \">Précis de la géographie universelle ... - Google Recherche de Livres</a>\nPage 45\nThe Albanians are the descendants of the Illyrians, who mingled | Albumin. formerly with the Pelasgic Greeks, and at a later period with the modern ; enough ...\nPage 57\n... f 6. .r'toli, (probably Illyrians.) 7- Hellenes, called formerly ...\nPage 59\n... or Illyrians, or Slavonians. y, ...\nPage 60\n... mixed with the ancient Illyrians, Greeks, and Celts. ...\nPage 80\nThe Illyrians resisted the Macedonian kings and the Roman legions ; if the Arnauts or Albanians who wander in the same regions, be .not\nPage 105\n...

La partie ottomane a porté successivement les noms de royaume de Rama, et de duché de Saint-Saba, d'où sont venues, dans les traductions bosniaque et turque, les dénominations de hertzegovina (le duché), et hersek (le duc); nous y reviendrons. Celle partie est inaccessible aux voyageurs dans ses extrémités nord-est, où la rivière de Moracca arrose sa vallée solitaire.\nOn connaît mieux le bassin calcaire et fertile de Ti'ébi- gne, ou de Trilunia, ville fortifiée, de 9,000 âmes, la plupart anciens Serbes, passés au mahométisme^ et si fanatiques, qu'ils obligent l'évèque catholique de^la ville à demeurer à Raguse.

Le cours de cette rivière s'oppose diamétralement à l'opinion des Ragusains qui regardent le fleuve d'Ombla (0 comme l'issue souterraine du lac de Popovo. D'ailleurs le gouffre absorbe si peu la totalité des eaux, que les campagnes de Popovo en restent couvertes le plus souvent dans l'arrière-saison (2). En remontant les bords de la Narenla, où les marais répandent un air pestilentiel, nous trouvons la ville florissante, mais peu fortifiée, de Mostar, qui compte 10,000 habitans, et qui fabrique des lames à la façon de Damas ; elle tire son nom du pont de pierre d'une seule voûte de 5o aunes d'ouverture sur lequel on passe la Narenta, et qui fut construit par un menuisier de la ville, après que les architectes turcs en avaient désespéré (3). Les environs s'ornent d'oliviers, de vergers et surtout de bons vignobles.

Ces terres, malgré l'apathie des habitans et leur peu de soin à profiter des engrais, sont d'une grande fertilité, principalement le long de'la Drina, de la Verbqgna, et de la Korovitza. Le sol de la Bosnie propre, de la Croatie et de la Rachie, est presque partout d'une qualité supérieure. C'est toujours dans les vallées, comme sur les revers des montagnes, une épaisse couche de terre végétale. Sur les sommets des montagnes, on trouve une terre aussi fertile, quoique plus légère (i). Ces remarques d'un voyageur français sont cependant modifiées par un observateur allemand qui, dans ses courses multipliées, a jugé que la majeure partie du sol de la Bosnie serait mieux employée à l'éducation des bestiaux qu'à la culture des blés (2). Les sommets rocailleux des montagnes sont parfumés de thym, de romarin, et d'autres herbes aromatiques et vigoureuses. Les bords de la Save sont couverts de marais très-étendus. Dans la partie septentrionale, les cerisiers, les pruniers, les poiriers, les pommiers, les noyers, les cognassiers, les noisetiers, ornent des vergers plantés sans symétrie : les contrées méridionales possèdent encore des pêchers, des abricotiers, des figuiers, des amandiers.

                "Battle of Kosovo | Military Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nBelgrade\nThe Battle of Kosovo, also known as the Battle of Kosovo Field or the Battle of Blackbird's Field (Serbian language: Косовска битка, Бој на Косову; Kosovska bitka; Boj na Kosovu; Turkish language: Kosova Meydan Savaşı), took place on St. Vitus' Day , June 15, [A] 1389, between the army led by Serbian Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović , and the invading army of the Ottoman Empire under the leadership of Sultan Murad I . The army under Prince Lazar consisted of his own troops, a contingent led by Serbian nobleman Vuk Branković , and a contingent sent from Bosnia by King Tvrtko I , commanded by Vlatko Vuković . [1] [3] Prince Lazar was the ruler of Moravian Serbia , and the most powerful among the Serbian regional lords of the time, while Vuk Branković ruled a part of Kosovo and other areas, recognizing Lazar as his overlord. The Battle of Kosovo took place in the Kosovo Polje , about 5 kilometers northwest of modern-day Pristina.\nReliable historical accounts of the battle are scarce; however, a critical comparison with historically contemporaneous battles (such as Angora or Nikopolis ) enables reliable reconstruction. [2] The bulk of both armies was wiped out in the battle; [1] both Lazar and Murad lost their lives in it. Although Ottomans managed to annihilate the Serbian army, they also suffered high casualties which delayed their progress. Serbs were left with too few men to effectively defend their lands, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Consequently, the Serbian principalities that were not already Ottoman vassals, one after the other became so in the following years. [1]\nThe Battle of Kosovo is particularly important to Serbian history, tradition, and national identity. [4]\nContents\nEdit\nEmperor Stefan Uroš IV Dušan the Mighty (r. 1331-1355) was succeeded by his son Stefan Uroš V (r. 1355-1371) whose reign was characterized by decline of central power and rise of numerous virtually independent principalities; this period is known as the fall of the Serbian Empire . Uroš the Weak was not able to sustain the great empire created by his father nor to repulse the foreign threats and failed to limit the independence of the nobles. Uroš V died childless on 4 December 1371, after much of the Serbian nobility had been destroyed by the Turks in the Battle of Maritsa earlier that year. Prince Lazar , ruler of Moravian Serbia , aware of the Ottoman threat, began diplomatic and military preparations for a campaign against the Ottomans.\nPreparations\nEdit\nAfter the defeat of the Ottomans at Pločnik (1386) and Bileća (1388) , Murad I , the reigning Ottoman sultan, moved his troops from Philippoupolis (Plovdiv in modern Bulgaria) in the spring of 1389 to Ihtiman . From there, the party traveled across Velbužd ( Kyustendil ) and Kratovo (present-day Macedonia ). Though longer than the alternative route through Sofia and the Nišava Valley , this route led the Ottoman party to Kosovo, one of the most important crossroads in the Balkans. From Kosovo, Murad's party could attack the lands of either Lazar of Serbia or Vuk Branković . Having stayed in Kratovo for a time, Murad and his troops marched through Kumanovo, Preševo and Gnjilane to Pristina, where he arrived on June 14. [2]\nWhile there is less information about Lazar's preparations, he gathered his troops near Niš, on the right bank of the South Morava River. His party likely remained there until he learned that Murad had moved to Velbužd, whereupon he moved across Prokuplje to Kosovo. This was the best place Lazar could choose as a battlefield, as it gave him control of all the routes that Murad could take. [2]\nArmy composition\n<center>Sultan Murad I\nMurad's army numbered from 27,000 to 40,000 fighters. [B] [2] These 40,000 included no more than 2,000 Janissaries , [5] 2,500 of Murad's cavalry guard, 6,000 sipahis , 20,000 azaps and akincis , and 8,000 troops from his vassals. [2] Marko and Dragaš, although Ottoman vassals, did not participate in the battle. [6]\nLazar's army numbered from 12,000 to 30,000. [B] [2] Out of approximately 30,000 fighters present, 12,000 to 15,000 were under Lazar's command, with 5,000 to 10,000 under Vuk Branković , a Serbian nobleman from Kosovo, and just as many under nobleman Vlatko Vuković . [2] The latter troops were sent by Bosnian king Tvrtko I Kotromanic . Mixed with Vuković's army was a contingent of Knights Hospitallers , whom the Croatian knight John of Palisna had led from Vrana in Croatia. [7] Several thousand were cavalry . [8] Furthermore, there has been several anachronistical accounts which have mentioned that the \"Christian army\" of Lazar was far greater, and that it also included contingents of other nations, although these cannot be verified. [C]\nBattle\nEdit\nThe armies met at Kosovo Field . Murad headed the Ottoman army, with his sons Bayezid on his right and Yakub on his left. Around 1,000 archers were in the front line in the wings, backed up by azap and akinci ; in the front center were janissaries , behind whom was Murad, surrounded by his cavalry guard; finally, the supply train at the rear was guarded by a small number of troops. [8] One of the Ottoman commanders was Pasha Yiğit Bey . [9]\nThe Serbian army had Prince Lazar at its center, Vuk on the right and Vlatko on the left. At the front of the Serbian army were the heavy cavalry and archer cavalry on the flanks, with the infantry to the rear. While parallel, the dispositions of the armies were not symmetrical, as the Serbian center had a broader front than the Ottoman center. [8]\nStart\nEdit\nSerbian and Turkish accounts of the battle differ, making it difficult to reconstruct the course of events. It is believed that the battle commenced with Ottoman archers shooting at Serbian cavalry, who then made for the attack. After positioning in a V-shaped formation,[ citation needed ] the Serbian cavalry managed to break through the Ottoman left wing, but were not as successful against the center and the right wing. [8]\nBattle of Kosovo, by Adam Stefanović (1870)\nOttoman counterattack\nEdit\nThe Serbs had the initial advantage after their first charge, which significantly damaged the Turkish wing commanded by Yakub Celebi. [3] When the knights' charge was finished, light Ottoman cavalry and light infantry counter-attacked and the Serbian heavy armour became a disadvantage. In the center, Serbian fighters managed to push back Ottoman forces, except for Bayezid's wing, which barely held off the forces commanded by Vlatko Vuković . Vuković thus inflicted disproportionately heavy losses on the Turks. The Ottomans, in a ferocious counter-attack led by Bayezid, pushed the Serbian forces back and then prevailed later in the day, routing the Serbian infantry. Both flanks still held, with Vuković's drifting toward the center to compensate for the heavy losses inflicted on the Serbian infantry.\nHistoric facts say that Vuk Branković had seen that there was no hope for victory, and fled to save as many men as he could. He fled after Lazar was captured, but in songs, it is said that he betrayed Lazar, and left him to death in middle of battle rather than after Lazar was captured and the center massacred.\nSometime after Branković's retreat from the battle, the remaining Bosnian and Serb forces yielded the field, believing that a victory was no longer possible.\nMurad's death\nEdit\nMiloš Obilić , the alleged assassin of Sultan Murad I.\nAs the battle turned against the Serbs, one of their noblemen, a knight named Miloš Obilić , pretended to desert to the Turkish forces. When he was brought before Murad, Obilić pulled out a hidden dagger and killed the Sultan by slashing him from belly to neck. The Sultan's bodyguards immediately hacked Miloš Obilić to pieces. [10] [11] [12] [13]\nThe earliest preserved record, a letter from the Florentine senate to King Tvrtko I of Bosnia dated 20 October 1389, says that Murad was killed during the battle. The killer is not named, but it was one of 12 Serbian noblemen who managed to break through the Ottoman lines:\nFortunate, most fortunate are those hands of the twelve loyal lords who, having opened their way with the sword and having penetrated the enemy lines and the circle of chained camels, heroically reached the tent of Murat himself. Fortunate above all is that one who so forcefully killed such a strong vojvoda by stabbing him with a sword in the throat and belly. And blessed are all those who gave their lives and blood through the glorious manner of martyrdom as victims of the dead leader over his ugly corpse. [14]\nAnother Italian account, Mignanelli's 1416 work, asserted that it was Lazar who killed Ottoman sultan. [15]\nSuccession of the Ottoman throne\n<center> Kosovo Maiden by Uroš Predić , based on the Serbian epic poem\nThe dying Pavle Orlović is given water by a maiden who seeks her fiancée, he tells her that her love, Milan , and his two blood-brothers Miloš and Ivan are dead.\nThe bulk of both armies were wiped out in the battle; [1] both Lazar and Murad lost their lives, and the remnants of their armies eventually retreated from the battlefield.  The Serbs were left with too few men to defend their lands effectively, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Consequently, the Serbian principalities that were not already Ottoman vassals, one after the other became so in the following years. [1] Furthermore, in response to Turkish pressure, [17] some Serbian noblemen wed their daughters, including the daughter of Prince Lazar, to Bayezid. [18] [19] In the wake of these marriages, Stefan Lazarević became a loyal ally of Bayezid, going on to contribute significant forces to many of Bayezid's future military engagements, including the Battle of Nicopolis . Eventually, the Serbian Despotate would, on numerous occasions, attempt to defeat the Ottomans in conjunction with the Hungarians until its final defeat in 1459 and again in 1540.\nThe Battle of Kosovo came to be seen as a symbol of Serbian patriotism and desire for independence in the 19th century rise of nationalism under Ottoman rule, including the Kosovo curse , and its significance for Serbian nationalism returned to prominence during the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo War when Slobodan Milošević invoked it during an important speech . [20]\nSee also\nEdit\n^ Date: Some sources attempt to give the date as June 28 in the New-Style Gregorian calendar, but that was not adopted for another two centuries. If it had been, the New-Style date in 1389 would have been only June 23. (see: Proleptic Gregorian calendar )\n^ a b c Strength: Estimate vary, although with the Ottomans having greater numbers;\nAccording to Sedlar: \"Nearly the entire Christian fighting force (between 12,000 and 20,000 men) had been present at Kosovo, while the Ottomans (with 27,000 to 30,000 on the battlefield) retained numerous reserves in Anatolia.\" [21]\nAccording to Cox: \"The Ottoman army probably numbered between 30,000 and 40,000. They faced something like 15,000 to 25,000 Eastern Orthodox soldiers.\" [22]\nAccording to Cowley: \"On June 28, 1389, an Ottoman army of between thirty thousand and forty thousand under the command of Sultan Murad I defeated an army of Balkan allies numbering twenty-five thousand to thirty thousand under the command of Prince Lazar of Serbia at Kosovo Polje (Field of Blackbirds) in the central Balkans.\" [23]\n^ According to some sources, the Christian army led by Prince Lazar included contingents sent from Poland and Hungary, [24] and contingents of Albanians led by Đurađ Balšić , Dhimitër Jonima , and Teodor II Muzaka , as well as Wallachian troops of Voivode Mircea the Elder . [25] [[[|page needed]]] Claims about such a coalition of Christian rulers first appeared about eighty years after the battle in a book written by an Ottoman author, Oruç of Edirne, and were repeated by later Turkish historians. [26] Some of them added also Franks, Czechs, and Bulgarians to the aforementioned troops, claiming that there were 500,000 soldiers in the \"Christian coalition\". The reason for the Ottomans to represent the Battle of Kosovo in this way might lie in the fact that it was the only battle in which an Ottoman sultan was killed. [26]\nThe alleged participation of Đurađ II Balšić , the lord of Zeta , in Lazar's army is improbable: he had previously become an Ottoman vassal; he was in hostility with Lazar's ally Tvrtko I; and at the time of the battle he was most likely in Ulcinj . [27] The participation of Teodor Muzaka and other Albanians is suggested by a family history of the Muzaka (Musachi) family, [27] written in Naples in c. 1515 by John Musachi, who stated the following: \"Lazar, the Despot of Serbia, and King Marko of Bulgaria (Bulgaria's monarch in 1389 was Tsar Ivan Shishman , who had been under the Ottoman overlordship since 1373. King Marko is referred to also as the king of Serbia in John Musachi's chronicle.) and Theodore Musachi, (Theodore Musachi is the younger brother of John Musachi's father, Gjin. According to the chronicle, Theodore died in the Battle of Kosovo, about 125 years before his nephew wrote the chronicle.) and the other Lords of Albania united and set off for battle, which the Christians lost.\" [28] Robert Elsie , expert on Albanian studies, characterizes John Musachi's chronicle as \"no work of great scholarship\" whose historical accounts are confusing, although it is an important source for late 15th-century Albania.

His father Pribac was a Logotet-secretary doing very               confidential work for King Dusan the Powerful in the royal  palace.              Young Lazar was raised in the palace, and was  respected by the King              who entrusted him with the rule of  two parts of his kingdom: Srem              and Macva. Lazar married  Milica the daughter of an important aristocrat              named Vratko  also known as Yug Bogdan - a very wise and honorable              man  from the Nemanjic family. Lazar had three sons: Stevan, Vuk and               Lazar and five daughters: Jelena, Mara, Despa, Vukosava and Mileva.\nKing Dusan the Powerful died unexpectantly in 1355 at the  age of 48.              This led to a weakening of Serbia's central  government. Many dukes              used this opportunity to secede from  the Kingdom with the land that              had been entrusted to them.  The young son of Dusan Uros took over              the throne and soon  was killed. Vukasin Mrnjacevic proclaimed himself              the King  of Serbia. At this time, Turks were advancing toward the               Kingdom of Serbia. In a battle on the river Marica in 1371, Vukasin               was killed leaving behind him a weakened, poor and torn Serbia.  Serbia              was in desperate need of a gifted statesman, rich  in virtue and deserving              of God's Grace: a man similar to  St.Sava and his father St. Stefan              Nemanja who had founded  the Serbian state. The Church recognized just              such a man in  Prince Lazar. His talent for leadership, wisdom and               experience lifted him above those who would seize the throne by force               and sought their own glory and importance.\nPrince Lazar, first sought to consolidate and strengthen the  Kingdom.              As was the custom of that day and age, he married  his daughters to              the rebellious Serbian aristocrats. This  enlarged and stabilized Serbia.              Having thus secured the  loyalty of dissident aristocrats, Prince Lazar              turned to  those countries which bordered his own, seeking to deepen               Serbia's relationship with them.\nAt this time, the Serbian Orthodox Church was in a dispute  with the              Patriarch of Constantinople. King Dusan the  Powerful wanted Serbia              to have an independent Church. He  single-handedly sought to elevate              the Serbian archbishop to  the level of a patriarch. The Patriarch              of Constantinople  utterly rejected this act and broke relations with              the  Church in Serbia. This was a very serious problem and one which               King Lazar managed to solve by reconciling the Serbian Church and               that of Constantinople. It was a result of this  reconciliation that              gave the Serbian Church its first  canonical Patriarch.\nThe expansion of that Ottoman state, and increasingly  frequent Turkish              raids into his land, warned Prince Lazar  that the time for a decisive              battle was drawing near.  Lengthy preparation on both sides preceded              this  confrontation. The fact that the armies were led by the Turkish               ruler Murad 1 and by King Lazar of Serbia illustrates the  importance              of this battle. It was decided that the site of  the battle would be              a field in Kosovo (Kosovo Polje).\nPrince Lazar knew that his chances against the Turkish  aggressor were              small and on the eve of the Battle of Kosovo  he gathered his upper              aristocracy and asked if they should  fight for the Holy cross and              Golden Freedom or surrender  to their adversaries and live as slaves              of the Muslims.  They had to chose between the Heavenly Kingdom and              earthly  one. In the true spirit of Christianity they preferred to               place their hope in Christ and Eternal Life. The Prince and all of               this warriors took Holy communion and went into battle on Saint  Vitus              Day, Tuesday June 15th 1389.\nSt. Prince Lazar on a 19c. Serbian painting\nArmy composition\nIt is not certain how large the armies were, especially as later sources  tend to exaggerate on their size, launching it into the hundreds of  thousands.\nMurad's army might have numbered 27-40,000. Taking the 40,000  estimate, it probably included some 5,000 Janissaries, 2,500 of Murad's  cavalry guard, 6,000 sipahis, 20,000 azaps and akincis and 8,000 of his  vassals Lazar's might have been 12-30,000. Taking the estimate of  25,000, some 15,000 were under Lazar's command, 5,000 Vuk's, and as many  of Vlatko's. Of those, several thousands were cavalry, but perhaps only  several hundreds were clad in full plate armor. Both armies included  some foreign troops: for example, the Serbian force included the  Croatian ban Ivan Palinza with a small number of troops, probably as a  part of Bosnian contingent while the Turkish army was helped by the  Serbian noble Konstantin Dejanovic. This led some authors to describe  the armies as coalitions.\nTroop disposition\nThe armies met at Kosovo field. The center of the Turkish army was led  by Murad, while his son Bayezid was on the right wing and Yakub on the  left. Around 1,000 archers were in the first line of the wings, followed  with azap and then akinci; in the front of the center were janissary,  behind whom was Murad, surrounded by his cavalry guard; finally, the  supply train was at the rear, guarded by a small number of troops. The  Serbian army had Lazar at the center, Vuk on the right wing and Vlatko  on the left. In the front of the Serbian army were placed the cavalry,  with the infantry to the rear. While parallel, the dispositions were not  symmetric, as Serbian center overlapped the Turkish\nThe Battle\nThe battle started with Turkish archers shooting at the Serbian cavalry,  which then moved into the attack. They managed to break through the  Turkish left wing, but were not as successful against the center and the  right wing. The Serbs initially gained the advantage after their first  charge, which heavily damaged the Turkish wing commanded by Jakub  Celebi. In the center, the Serbian fighters managed to push the Ottoman  forces back with only Bayezid's wing holding off the forces commanded by  Vlatko Vukovic. The Ottomans, in a counter-attack, pushed the Balkan  forces back and prevailed later in the day. Bayezid I, who would after  the battle become the Ottoman sultan, gained his nickname \"the  thunderbolt\" in this battle, after leading the decisive counter-attack.  In the main, numbers of Turkish military strength (army) and better  weapons eventually won them the day.\nMurad's Death\nBased on the Turkish historical records, it is believed that the  Sultan was killed by Miloï¿½ Obilić, who was pretending to be dead, while  the Sultan was walking in the battlefield after the battle. On the other  hand, according to Serbian records he was assassinated by Miloï¿½ Obilić,  who made his way into the Turkish camp on the pretext of being a  deserter and knelt before the Sultan. He stabbed him in the stomach  while about to kneel before him.

This Serbian culture was  retarded for five              centuries, after the Serbian defeat on  the plain of Kosovo.\nFrom              a  culture that led Europe and the Balkans during the Medieval period,               the Serbian culture degenerated and stagnated, to the point  that when              it regained its freedom it had centuries to  recover. The Turkish victory              at Kosovo, was not as much  political as it was cultural. \"Turkish              historians lay more  stress on the Battle of Maritza eighteen years              before,  which they call Serb Sindin (Serbian defeat).\" The military               destiny of Serbia was sealed at Maritza. Contemporary chroniclers,               without the benefit of hindsight, felt that Kosovo was only one  of              a series of bloody engagements, leading to the collapse  of the Serbian              kingdom.\nWhat               then is the importance of the Battle of Kosovo? It was a  cultural              defeat, a religious defeat. It became the symbol  of Turkish power              and Serbian defeat, not to be forgotten . .  . revenge was always over              the horizon. The grand Serbian  culture, which flourished under Tzar's              Dushan and Milutin,  was only a memory, after Serbia's knights, armies              and hopes  died at the field of Kosovo.\n\"The               State was destroyed, but underneath was born from pain and  from battle              a strong people.\" It was this strong people,  that clung to their              own culture, or a remnant of it against  time and the Turks. The Battle              at Kosovo Polje is one of  the focal points of their memories, and              as such played a  vital role in the Serbian culture.\nThe               binding force in Serbian Culture is its national religion.  When in              1190 Nemanja set up a state, from the chaos of the  third crusade,              the people's religion was not a national  concern. His son, now known              as St. Sava, brought the  Eastern Orthodox Church to Serbia, and set              up an oriental  culture, leaning toward Byzantium. St. Sava also separated               the church from Byzantine rule, and placed the church establishment               in the service of the nation. This was the first national  church,              untied to either Greek Orthodox or Roman dictates.  This policy of              separation was continued through Tzar  Dushan's reign (1331-1355) when              he planned and executed all  possible activities halting the influence              of the Roman  church in his state.\nThis               national religion needed a base, or platform to be effective. The               monastery was \"chosen\" for this purpose. In fact by 1430               there were 3,000 monasteries and churches in Serbia. These  institutions              were the basic educational and cultural  establishments of their day.              An example of the high culture  prevalent in the monasteries at the              end of the thirteenth  century, Queen Jelena founded a type of \"womans'              home  keeping school\" at Brnjeval near today's Kosovska Mitrovica.               The building and maintaining of monasteries and church institutions               are shown in many of the ballads from the period, \"The  Building              of Ravanitsa\" (a monastery) is one example. This  poem speaks              of the construction of a church institution as a  duty of the Tzar.\nIn               the Serbian society literacy was limited to a narrow  circle, mainly              religious in character. However, there are  proofs that literacy often              passed the bounds of the  religion sector. An example of the literature              of the time  is a biography of St. Sava written by Monk Teodisije in              the  thirteenth through fourteenth centuries. The monasteries besides               being centers of education and literature were centers of art.\nIn              these monasteries were created beautiful  frescos, paintings, tapestries              and handicrafts. The art of  Serbia of the thirteenth century is considered              independent  and \"convincingly superior\" to the art of Byzantium. \"On  the vast territory of Dusan's empire there were a number              of  smaller provincial centers of art . . . in spite of their local               character, the works produced there had two great assets; they  were              numerous and of high technical accomplishment,\" The  architecture              of the monasteries also represents a special  achievement for its time.\nOther               cultural achievements of the Serbs lie in the field of  politics and              government. Militarily the Serbs had been on  the rise continually              and under Tzar Dushan they controlled  Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia,              Albania and parts of Greece.  At the time of his death, Tzar Dushan              was planning to  resist the Turks and attack Constantinople. Under              Tzars  Milutin through Dushan, Serbia was moving toward its real mission               as a nation with wealth and power. The advances were not only in  military              spheres. Tzar Dushan also gave to the Serbs a law  which has importance              to the Serbs and to Southern Slave in  general. This law, the Zakonk,              was born of Byzantine and  other prevalent laws of the time, and can              be said to be a  picture of the Serbian social structure of justice              based on  law.\nAfter               Dushan's death the military strength of the autocracy decreased. In               1377 Knez Lazar (ruler of Serbia) was forced to accept the  crowning              of Tvrtka I at Milesevo (St. Sava's grave) making  him (Tvrtka I) king              of Bosnia, with rights over Serbia. The  clash with the Turks found              the Serbs at the teak of their  national feeling and culture.\nWhen               fourteenth century Serbia achieved its political peak most  European              countries were second-rate powers. Individual  nation states were only              evolving in Europe at the time when  Serbia's star was already falling.              The \"countries\" of  Europe were still subservient to the              church of Rome, until  the seventeenth century, while Serbia developed              a national  church in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This superior               culture faced the Ottoman Turks. This was a clash of not only  military              strength, but of faiths and ways of life.\nThough              the major motivating forces were  political, cultural and religious              feelings and motives also  played a part in the battle of Kosovo. \"The              Turkish system  of occupying conquered countries with military colonies               and carrying off the original inhabitants, excited a great national               opposition in the year 1389.\" This policy which would destroy               the culture and religion of Serbia as well as the state,  enraged the              people. They felt that \"the Ottomans were alien  barbarians with              a lesser civilization and a religion  totally different from that of              the conquered.\" Both the  Turks and Serbs were motivated by religious              Ideals; the  Turks for Islam, and the Serbs for Christianity.\nBarring              other motives, both parties were  politically opposed. The conflict              had begun with small  marauding raids the Turks pushed across the Dardanelles.               When they established a foothold in the Balkans the conflict \".               . . progressed too more serious . . . and finally to a full scale               campaign.\"\nIt              is  felt that Tzar Dushan might have held back the Turks, but at his               death his empire fragmented. Lacking a common culture or political               tradition the empire collapsed, leaving. Its remnants open  to Turkish              encroachment.\n________________\n\"Of              course the great task for the Serbian  statesman of that time was,              how to stem the further  progress of the Ottoman Turks and drive them              back to Asia.\" Knez Lazar as elected chief of Serbia tried to              unify tie  country and stop the Turks. \"While Prince Lazar was               Infusing fresh vigor into the Serbian State, the danger from the Turks               was becoming increasingly pressing.\" Knez Lazar began to  form              a Christian league against the Turks. It was revealed  to Sultan Murad,              who promptly invaded Bulgaria and Serbia  to destroy the Christian              league. The political desires of  the two nations were diametrically              opposed; the Turks  wanted Serbian lands, and the Serbs survival.\nThe              final military struggle, the clash at Kosovo,  was a conflict of both              empires, economic systems, religions  and hopes. Bulgaria was subdued              first and then in 1339  Amurath (Murad I) marched against Knez Lazar,              ruler of  Serbia. \"A great assault on Serbia was organized by              the  Sultan Murad I . . . he penetrated to the field of Kosovo.\" \"In great haste he (Lazar) had to summon his noblemen to hurry               with their retinues to Kosovo to meet the Turkish army.\" Though               Knez Lazar called all his vassals, only some came, some were  late,              and some never started.\nLazar              wished to delay the battle, hoping more  reinforcements would arrive,              but on July 15 (28), 1389 the  Turks surprised the Serbs with an unexpected              attack. (The  date discrepancy is due to the acceptance of the Gregorian               calendar by the Serbs later than Europe). The Serbs led an army of               Bulgarians, Bosnians, Skepitars of Albania, with men from  Hungry,              Wallachia and Poland. It appeared that in the  beginning, the Turks              with an array of their vassals, were  losing. In truth, history knows              little or nothing of the  facts. It appears that the battle was one              of courage rather  than tactics.\n\"It              was  not a fight to the bitter end.\" Before the battle started,               it was lost, for the Serbs fearing treachery, lost courage. \"Victory               is never won by those who feel they are going to lose.\" \"All               the legends agree in suggesting that the Issue of the battle  was determined              by treason. A certain Vuk Brankovitch Is  represented as the Serbian              Judas who led his forces over to  the enemy at the crucial moment.\" However, the treachery  of Vuk Brankovic is not a proven historical              fact. \"Treachery is always the excuse of the vanquished, for              it  assuages the bitterness of defeat.\"\nBeyond               excuses and legend, both leaders, Knez Lazar and Sultan  Amurath were              killed during the battle. We know nothing  historically of how either              leader died. It is said that  Murad was killed by a false deserter,              and that dying he had  Knez Lazar brought before him and beheaded.              However, that  is only legend. At the reports of Murads death the western               world thought that Serbia had won, but his death did not affect the               course of the battle except that \"It considerably increased the               severity of Bayazids' treatment of his Serbian captives.\" This              led to the battle's major political importance, for  Bayazid, Murad's              heir, killed most of the Serbian princes  and nobles either in battle,              beheaded them immediately  after it, as revenge for his father's death.\nThe              two new rulers, Bayazid of the Ottoman's and  Stephan Lazarovitch of              the Serbs, made peace. The truce of  peace which followed \". .              . established the inferior  position of the Serbians.\" \"The              terms of the treaty then  agreed to were very moderate. Instead of              being incorporated  In the Ottoman Empire . . . Serbia was to be an              autonomous  state under vassalage to the Ottoman Empire . . . \" It is  known that this liberal peace came from the \"enforced\" marriage of Stephan's sister Oliva to Bayazid.\nAfter              the battle of Kosovo the Serbs did not  deceive themselves, It was              the death-knell to independence.  It destroyed all that was done in              the way of Statehood and  freedoms since the eleventh century and Nemanja.              Even  further destruction came in 1459 when Serbia was incorporated               into the Ottoman Empire proper. After that time Serbia was no longer               a true state.\n__________________\n\"The              battle of Kosovo, one of the most decisive  moments in the century-long              struggle of the Serbs against  the Turks, quickly became the subject              of legend.\" The  poets, bards or minstrels of Serbia were touched              to their  poetic souls, and wrote the legend of Kosovo. They were affected               because there was a foreigner, a conqueror, an occupier in their  land.              The legends, or poems are probably the most important  effect, political              or cultural that the battle at Kosovo  Polje had. They are important              because they helped the Serbs  to remember the battle and what their              past was. The  greatness of the legends or poems lies in their honesty.               The guslari (minstrels) did not hide the weaknesses which led to the               defeat, but glorified them. \"...what amazes one is the curious               fact that the very folk songs that glorify Saint Lazar and  lament              Kosova reveal a frank and true picture of the  events and prove how              little warrant there is for the  legend.\"\nThe               legends were needed, however, to help maintain the culture of the               Serbs. The Turkish victory cut off and destroyed the work of  Serbia's              leaders and founders, leaving the people alienated  from their culture.              To maintain a remnant of their  culture, the guslari sung their songs              of defeat and of  God's will to the people. As there are few cultural              or  artistic expressions as powerful as the guslari, they had a great               impact on their time. In the poems are all the social  relationships,              portrayed and examined, the culture  idealized. All that was good remembered,              the bad forgotten.  For cultural reasons these legends were essential.              If not  for the legends, the Serbian people might have forgotten their               past and adapted Turkish life styles. The epic poems prevented their               forgetting the past, as the poems taught in the schools,  filled the              minds of the people with heroes, and a heritage.  Their religion also              glorified in the epics also needed a  tool for survival, and the legends              complied. Once again the  legends helped the people remember their              religion, and to  be proud of the heritage they possessed.\nIn               the legends themselves are suggestions \". . . for a future  struggle              against the Turks . . . \" This led to the peoples  hope for a              future, thus for survival. The poems glorify  the defeat as an act              of God. They assuage the bitterness of  defeat by using scapegoats,              and traitors. In addition they  bring to mind the \"good old days\" of heroes and heroines  fighting for their country, king, and Christianity.\nThese              epics \"helped the Christian peasant to  preserve his ethnic individuality              and his faith.\" The  memories are still strong, \". . . and              in token of mourning  for that great national calamity (the Watterloo              of the  Serbian Empire) the Montenegrins still wear a black band on               their caps . . . Murad's heart is still preserved on the spot where               he died; Lazar's shroud is still treasured by the Hungarian  Serbs              in the monastery of Vrdnik; and in many a lonely  village the minstrel              sings to the sound of the gusle the  melancholy legend of Kosova.\" It Is these memories which  prevented the Serbs from self-pity, but              steeled them  against submission. When they needed support most the              epics  which \". . . so majestically touched on the defeated Serbian               nation . . . \" gave them the strength to withstand the slavery               and look toward freedom. Even today, years later, upon the rise  of              modern Serbian nationalism Kosovo became the symbol for  their national              Identity.\nThe               quality of the epics can also be spoken of. \"In their  description              of the events, especially where the poets  narrated the terrible tortures              during battle and  afterwards, they bring to mind the Italian poet              Dante's  Divine Comedy which also dates between the thirteenth and               fourteenth centuries.\" The Divine Comedy Is considered one of               the Western world's greatest classics. It was also said of the poems               that they were as good as, If not better than any Greek or  Latin poems              ever written. This was said by Jurag Sisgoric  (1487) in his work De              Situ Illyriae et civitate Sibenici.\nThese              legends and poems held the Serbian people  together in their memories              of pride and honor. The poems  can be said to be one of the major causes              for Serbia's  continued cultural and religious survival. However, the               battle of Kosovo also had direct negative effects on the Serbian people.               There was a terrible set back of their language,  civilization, nationality,              religion and of all they held  dear. This great catastrophe tested              Serbian moral,  religious, and physical strength.\nAfter               the battle of Kosovo the Turks were tolerant of religion  except when              it went into political spheres or sided with  rebels. Since there were              rebellions and struggles and since  the church worked with the rebellious              people, she also  suffered the wrath of the Turks. Of the 3,000 different               Church institutions half were destroyed or desecrated by the nineteenth               century.\nDespite               these persecutions the Serbian faith in their national religion made               it impossible for Islam to take over as it had in Bosnia,  Albania,              Macedonia and Bulgaria. In Serbia the Turks ruled  but could not destroy              its national identity.\nThough              under difficult conditions Stephan  Lazarovitch gathered together the              intelligencia of Serbia  to a monastery at Velika Morava, called Resava.              In this  monastery scribes and translators worked, and frescos covered               the walls. Between Knez Lazar and his son the Moravska school of art               and studies developed in the Velika Morava area.\n__________________\nOther              contributions to the culture of Serbia after  Kosovo mainly related              to the battle, commemorating it, and  its heroes, were: Konstantin              Mihajiovic wrote a biography  of Stephan Lazarovic; and the nuns Jefinije              and Grigorije  who made a tapestry dedicated to the death of Knez Lazar,               which is an object of great cultural importance to medieval art in               general.\nAfter               Kosovo, Serbian books were printed at Gorazde, Gracanica, Rujio,  Milesvo,              Beograde and Skadar. The Turks persecuted and  destroyed these publishers              because they served the Serbian  national purpose. The situation after              the battle was so bad  for the people, that in a letter from a Dubrovnik              family  to Serbian friends, the Serbians were invited to go to Dubrovnik, \"If they could not support themselves.\"\nDespite              the persecutions and bad economic  conditions, the Serbian people always              had a feeling of  optimism, remembering past glories and looking to              future  greatness. They survived five centuries of alien subjugation.               During those five centuries neither culture advanced, both Serbs and               Turks remained in a pocket of Feudal, Medieval life, till  the nineteenth              century. This stagnated culture, the culture  of the Serbs held down,              from flourishing as it had, sprang  back to life when it regained its              freedom. Although the  Serbs missed both renaissance and enlightenment,              due to the  Turkish occupation, they rapidly advanced, once freed,              due  to the heritage which they so zealously protected through some               five centuries.\nThey               are advancing because of their spirit and hopes. They are advancing               because of their pride and convictions. They are advancing  because              they remember, the humiliation of their fathers.  Their memory is long,              but vital and strong. It is this  memory of the battle of Kosovo that              kept the Serbian  culture alive.\nThe               Battle of Kosovo was a military loss to the Serbs. They lost country,               language, and hopes. Yet from this loss came the epic poems  of Serbia,              the stories of their past. I feel that this loss  of a battle enabled              the Serbs to win the war . . . of  cultural survival.\n \nA Serb warrior at Kosovo.\nVoyvoda Stefan\nThere were many Serbian nobles named \"Stefan\".

A fictitious character. In the  poems he is a Serb nobleman allied with Lazar . The name should be read as \"Milan from Toplica\". Toplica is a place name for a town, a region, and a  river in what is now southcentral Serbia. Toplica was site of one of  the original Serbian bishoprics. The river still bears the name.\nUglyesha\nUgljeï¿½a [\"oog-LYEH-sha\"]. Brother of Vukaï¿½in . A vassal of Stefan Duï¿½an,  he remained loyal to Duï¿½an's son Uroï¿½. As Ugljeï¿½a's lands lay nearest to  the area threatened by the growing Ottoman empire, it was Ugljeï¿½a who  worked hardest to collect allies to fight for Serbia in 1371. The mention of Ugljeï¿½a in the poem \" The Fall of the Serbian Empire \" is  historically inaccurate: The real Ugljeï¿½a was killed at Marica in 1371.\nVoyvoda Vladeta\nA variant name for Vlatko Vuković.  He commanded the Bosnian army,  which fought with Lazar at Kosovo, and was one of the  few Serb leaders to survive the battle. (At that time there was little  distinction between Serbian and Bosnian nationality.)\nKing Vukï¿½shin\nVukaï¿½in Mrnjavčević [\"voo-KAH-sheen murn-YAHV-che-vich\"], brother of Ugljeï¿½a . A powerful nobleman in  Stefan Duï¿½an's court, he remained loyal to Duï¿½an's son Uroï¿½. About  halfway into Uroï¿½'s reign, Vukaï¿½in came to be the real power behind the  throne and was named \"king\" (kralj). (According to the tradition of the  time the title for the monarch (Uroï¿½) was \"tsar\", and the title \"kralj\" was given to the designated successor.) The mention of Vukaï¿½in in the  poem \" The Fall of the Serbian Empire \" is  inaccurate: The real Vukaï¿½in was killed at Marica in 1371.\nAfter the deaths of Vukaï¿½in and Uroï¿½, Vukaï¿½in's son Marko inherited  the title of kralj. In spite of the fact that the historical Marko's  attempted reign was unsuccessful and undistinguished, he is the hero of  several later Serbian epics (not published here), in which he is known  as \"Marko Kraljević\". The same Marko is a hero of Bulgarian poetry as  well, in which he is known as \"Krali Marko\".\n \nA Turkish title, indicating a provincial governor in the Ottoman empire.\nTurk\nAt the time of the epics, the word \"Turk\" did not carry the ethnic  connotation it does today. The Serbs used the term \"Turk\" to refer to  any Muslim, regardless of ethnicity (as indeed they still do today). The  Ottomans at the time did not use the term \"Turk\" at all, identifying  themselves instead according to religion or political allegiance.\nVoyvoda\nVojvoda. A title, sometimes translated as \"duke\". Technically a  military commander, but also used to designate a subordinate territorial  ruler. The region ruled by a vojvoda is a \"vojvodina\" [\"voy-VOH-dee-na\"]. Vojvodina is also the name given to a region of  northern Serbia, near the Hungarian border.\nFootnotes\n1. Although the size of forces at Kosovo was indeed very large  for the time, the figures given in the epic poems are greatly  exaggerated. Typical estimates vary from 12,000 to 20,000 on the Serbian  side, and 27,000 to 30,000 on the Ottoman side.\n2. The ravens here are \"vrana\", not to be confused with \"kos\" (blackbird).\n3. It's a stretch to say that the Ottoman army came \"from  Turkey\" if by that is meant Asia Minor. At the time of the battle of  Kosovo (1389) the Ottomans had been established in Europe for three  decades. Since 1377 the Sultan's primary residence (one hesitates to  call it a \"capital\") was Adrianople, in Europe.\n4. I recognize only some of these place names, and they are  primarily in central and northern Serbia, within Lazar's realm. In the  mid-1380s Ottoman military activity in Europe was primarily in Thrace  and Macedonia, but there were several raids further north as well, both  by bands of independent marauders and by the Ottoman army itself.  Although the places listed here may well have been raided by Turkish  forces, I don't believe the list should be read as a historically  precise account of Ottoman military movements.\n5. Records indicate that Lazar and Milica did indeed have a daughter  named Mara who married Vuk Branković . I'm not aware of any  record of a daughter named Vukosava. The latter, who in the epic is  married to Miloï¿½ Obilić , I believe represents  Lazar and Milica's daughter Helen (Jelena), who was married to  Branković's rival George Balï¿½ić.\n6. Written accounts [e.g., Herodotus] record the presence of lions in the Balkans during the age of classical  Greece. Exactly when lions became extinct in Europe is not clear, but it  seems to be around the time of Christ. They were certainly gone by the  time of the battle of Kosovo.",
                "History of the Serbs\nHistory            of the Serbs\nOrigins\nThe Serbs are believed            to be a purely Slavic people who originated in Ukraine. Some scholars            now argue that the original Serbs and Croats were Central Asian Sarmatian            nomads who entered Europe with the Huns in the fourth century C.E. The            theory proposes that the Sarmatian Serbs settled in a land designated            as White Serbia, in what is now Saxony and western Poland. The Sarmatian            Serbs, it is argued, intermarried with the indigenous Slavs of the region,            adopted their language and transferred their name to the Slavs.\nArrival to the            Balkans\nByzantine sources            report that some Serbs migrated southward in the seventh century C.E.            and eventually settled in the lands that now make up southern Serbia,            Montenegro, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rival chiefs, or \"zupani,\" vied to control the Serbs for five centuries after the migration. Zupan            Vlastimir formed a Serbian principality under the Byzantines around            850, and the Serbs soon converted to Eastern Christianity. The Serbs            had two political centers in the 11th century: Zeta, in the mountains            of present-day Montenegro, and Raska, located in modern southwestern            Serbia.\nFirst Serbian            State\nThe zupan of Raska,            Stefan I Nemanja (1159-96), threw off Byzantine domination and laid            the foundation for medieval Serbia by conquering Zeta and part of southern            Dalmatia. His son and successor, Stefan II Nemanja (1196-1228), transformed            Serbia into a stable state, friendly with Rome but with religious loyalty            to Constantinople. In 1218, Pope Honorius III recognized Serbian political            independence and crowned Stefan II king. The writings of Stefan II and            his brother (canonized as St. Sava) were the first works of Serbian            literature.\nLater kings in the            Nemanja line overcame internal rivalries and pressure from Bulgaria            and Constantinople. They also rejected papal invitations to link the            Serbian Orthodox Church with Rome, and they ruled their country through            a golden age. Serbia expanded its economy, and Dalmatian merchants sold            Serbian goods throughout Europe and the Levant. The Nemanje dynasty            left to Serbia masterpieces of religious art combining Western, Byzantine            and local styles.\nSerbia dominated            the Balkans under Stefan Dusan (1331-55), who conquered lands extending            from Belgrade to present-day southern Greece. He proclaimed himself            emperor, elevated the archbishop of Pec to the level of patriarch, and            wrote a new legal code combining Byzantine law with Serbian customs.            Dusan had ambitions toward a weakened Byzantine Empire, but the Byzantine            emperor suspected his intentions and summoned the Turks to restrain            him. Dusan repelled assaults in 1345 and 1349, but was defeated in 1352.            He then offered to lead an alliance against the Turks and recognize            the pope, but those gambits also were rejected.\nRival nobles divided            Serbia after the death of Dusan in 1355, and many switched loyalty to            the sultan after the last Nemanja died in 1371. The most powerful Serbian            prince, Lazar Hrebeljanovic, raised a multinational force to engage            the Turks in the Battle of Kosovo Polje on St. Vitus Day in 1389. The            Turks barely defeated Lazar, and both he and the sultan were killed.            The defeat did not bring immediate Turkish occupation of Serbia, but            during the centuries of Turkish domination that followed, the Serbs            endowed the battle with myths of honor and heroism that helped them            preserve their dignity and sense of nationhood. Serbs still recite epic            poems and sing songs about the nobles who fell at Kosovo Polje. The            anniversary of the battle is the Serbian national holiday, Vidovdan            (St. Vituss Day), June 28.\nSt. Milutin, the King of Serbia fresco in Gracanica Monastery\nTurkish Conquest            of Serbia\nCivil war in the            Turkish Empire saved Serbia in the early 15th century, but the Turks            soon reunited their forces to conquer the last Serbian stronghold at            Smederjevo in 1459 and subjugate the whole country. Serbs fled to Hungary,            Montenegro, Croatia, Dalmatia and Bosnia, and some formed outlaw bands.            In response to the activities of the latter, the Turks disinterred and            burned the remains of St. Sava.\nBy the 16th century,            southern Hungary had a sizable Serbian population that remained after            the Turks conquered the region in 1526. Montenegro, which emerged as            an independent principality after the death of Dusan, waged continual            guerrilla war on the Turks, and was never conquered. The Turkish threat,            however, did force Prince Ivan of Montenegro to move his capital high            into the mountains. There, he founded a monastery and set up a printing            press. In 1516 Montenegro became a theocratic state.\nSocial and economic            life in Serbia changed radically under the absolute rule of the Turkish            sultan. The Turks split Serbia among several provinces, conscripted            Serbian boys into their elite forces, exterminated Serbian nobles, and            deprived the Serbs of contact with the West as the Renaissance was beginning.            The Turks used the Orthodox Church to intermediate between the state            and the peasantry, but they expropriated most church lands. Poorly trained            Serbian priests strove to maintain the decaying national identity.\nIn 1459, the sultan            subordinated the Serbian Church to the Greek patriarch, but the Serbs            hated Greek dominance of their church, and in 1557, Grand Vizier Mehmed            Pasha Sokolovic, a Serb who had been inducted into the Turkish army            as a boy, persuaded the sultan to restore autonomy to the Serbian Church.            Turkish maltreatment and exploitation grew in Serbia after the 16th            century, and more Serbs fled to become \"hajduci\" (mountain            outlaws).\nUnsuccessful            Serb Rebellions\nFrom 1684 to 1689,            Christian forces attempted to push the Turks from the Balkans, inciting            the Serbs to rebel against their Turkish overlords. The offensive rebellion            ultimately failed, exposing the Serbs south of the Sava River to the            revenge of the Turks. Fearing Turkish reprisals, the Serbian patriarch,            Arsenije III Carnojevic, immigrated in 1690 to Austrian-ruled southern            Hungary with as many as 36,000 families.\nGreat            Serb Migration in front of Ottomans, 1690\nThe Austrian emperor            promised these people religious freedom as well as the right to elect            their own \"vojvoda\" (military governor), and incorporated            much of the region where they settled, later known as Vojvodina, into            the military border. The refugees founded new monasteries that became            cultural centers. In Montenegro, Danilo I Petrovic of Njegos (1696-1737)            became bishop-prince and instituted the succession of the Petrovic-Njegos            family. His efforts to unify Montenegro triggered a massacre of Muslims            in 1702 and subsequent reprisals.\nAustrian forces            took Serbian regions south of the Sava from Turkey in 1718, but Jesuits            following the army proselytized so heavily that the Serbs came to hate            the Austrians as well as the Turks. In the 18th century, the Turkish            economy and social fabric began deteriorating, and the Serbs who remained            under the Ottoman Empire suffered attacks from bands of soldiers. Corrupt            Greek priests, who had replaced Serbian clergy at the sultans            direction, also took advantage of the Serbs. The Serbs in southern Hungary            fared much better. They farmed prosperously in the fertile Danubian            plain. A Serbian middle class arose, and the monasteries trained scholars            and writers who inspired national pride, even among illiterate Serbs.\nThe 18th century            brought Russian involvement in European events, particularly in competition            with Austria for the spoils of the Turkish collapse. The Orthodox Serbs            looked to the tsar for support, and Russia forged ties with Montenegro            and the Serbian Church in southern Hungary. In 1774, Russia won the            diplomatic right to protect Christian subjects of the Turks; later it            used this right as a pretext to intervene in Turkish affairs.\nWhen Russia and            Austria fought another war with Turkey in 1787 and 1788, Serbs fought            guerrilla battles against the Turks. Austria abandoned the campaign,            and the Serbs, in 1791. To secure their frontier, the Turks granted            their Serbian subjects a measure of autonomy and formed a Serbian militia.            Montenegro expanded in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Bishop-Prince            Petar I Njegos (1782-1830) convinced the sultan to declare that the            Montenegrins had never been Turkish subjects, and Montenegro remained            independent through the 19th century.\nIn 1804, renegade            Turkish soldiers in Belgrade murdered Serbian leaders, triggering a            popular uprising under Karadjordje (\"Black George\") Petrovic,            founder of the Karadjordjevic dynasty. Russia supported the Serbs, and            in 1806, the sultan granted them limited autonomy. Internal discord,            however, weakened the government of Karadjordje, and the French invasion            of Russia in 1812 prevented the tsar from protecting the Serbs.\nIn 1813, the Turks            attacked rebel areas. Karadjordje fled to Hungary, then Turkish, Bosnian            and Albanian troops plundered Serbian villages. The atrocities sparked            a second Serbian uprising in 1815 that won autonomy under Turkish control            for some regions. The corrupt rebel leader Milos Obrenovic (1817-39)            had Karadjordje murdered and his head sent to the sultan to signal Serbian            loyalty.\nSerbia as Principality\nIn 1830, Turkey            recognized Serbia as a principality under Turkish control, with Milos            Obrenovic as hereditary prince. The sultan also granted the Serbian            Church autonomy and reaffirmed the Russian right to protect Serbia.            Poor administration, corruption and a bloody rivalry between the Karadjordjevic            and Obrenovic clans marred Serbian political life from its beginning.\nAfter the sultan            began allowing foreign governments to send diplomats to Serbia in the            1830s, foreign intervention further complicated the situation. Despite            these obstacles and his autocratic manner, however, Milos Obrenovic            stimulated trade, opened schools and guided development of peasant lands.            He abdicated in 1838 when Turkey imposed a constitution to limit his            powers.\nIn the 18th and            19th centuries, Serbian culture made significant strides. Dositej Obradovic,            Vuk Karadzic and other scholars accelerated a national renaissance.            Through his translations and autobiography, Obradovic spread the Enlightenment            to the Serbs. Collections of Serbian folk songs and poems edited by            Karadzic awoke pride in national history and traditions. Karadzic also            overcame clerical opposition to reform the Cyrillic alphabet and the            Serbian literary language, and he translated the New Testament. His            work widened the concept of Serbian nationhood to include language as            well as religious and regional identifications.\nThe European revolution            of 1848 eroded relations between the Serbs and their neighbors. As part            of their revolutionary program, the Hungarians threatened to Magyarize            the Serbs in Vojvodina. Some Serbs there declared their independence            from Hungary and proclaimed an autonomous Vojvodina; others rallied            behind the Austrian-Croatian invasion of Hungary. The Serbs nearly declared            war, but Russians and Turkish diplomacy restrained them. The Serbs in            Hungary gained nothing from helping Austria to crush the revolution.            Vienna ruled Vojvodina harshly after 1850 and silenced Serbian irredentists            there.\nWhen Austria joined            Hungary to form the Dual Monarchy in 1867, Vienna returned Vojvodina            and its Serbs to Hungary. Meanwhile, Peter II Njegos of Montenegro (1830-51),            who was also a first-rate poet, reformed his administration, battled            the Turks and struggled to obtain a seaport from the Austrians. His            successor, Danilo II (1851-60), abolished the Montenegrin theocracy.\nPrince Mihajlo Obrenovic            (1860-68), son of Milos, was an effective ruler who further loosened            the Turkish grip on Serbia. Western-educated and autocratic, Mihajlo            liberalized the constitution and, in 1867, secured the withdrawal of            Turkish garrisons from Serbian cities. Industrial development began            at this time, although 80 percent of Serbias 1.25 million people            remained illiterate peasants. Mihajlo sought to create a South Slav            confederation, and he organized a regular army to prepare for liberation            of Turkish-held Serbian territory. Scandal undermined Mihajlos            popularity, however, and he was eventually assassinated.\nCelekula - Skull Tower in Nis\nPolitical parties            emerged in Serbia after 1868, and aspects of Western culture began to            appear. A widespread uprising in the Ottoman Empire prompted an unsuccessful            attack by Serbia and Montenegro in 1876, and a year later those countries            allied with Russian, Romanian and Bulgarian rebels to defeat the Turks.            The subsequent treaties of San Stefano and Berlin (1878) made Serbia            an independent state and added to its territory, while Montenegro gained            a seacoast.\nAlarmed at Russian            gains, the growing stature of Serbia, and irredentism among Vojvodinas            Serbs, Austria-Hungary pressed for and won the right to occupy Bosnia,            Herzegovina and the Novi Pazar in 1878. Serbias Prince Milan Obrenovic            (1868-89), a cousin of Mihajlo, became disillusioned with Russia and            fearful of the newly created Bulgaria. He, therefore, signed a commercial            agreement in 1880 that made Serbia a virtual client state of Austria-Hungary.            Milan became the first king of modern Serbia in 1882, but his pro-Austro-Hungarian            policies undermined his popularity, and he abdicated in 1889.\nA regency ruled            Serbia until 1893, when Milans teenage son, Aleksandar (1889-1903),            pronounced himself of age and nullified the constitution. Aleksandar            was widely unpopular in Serbia because of scandals, arbitrary rule and            his position favoring Austria-Hungary. In 1903 military officers, including            Dragutin \"Apis\" Dimitrijevic, brutally murdered Aleksandar            and his wife. Europe condemned the killings, which were celebrated in            Belgrade.\nPetar Karadjordjevic            (1903-14), who knew of the conspiracy, returned from exile to take the            throne, restored and liberalized the constitution, put Serbian finances            in order, and improved trade and education. Petar turned Serbia away            from Austria-Hungary and toward Russia, and in 1905 Serbia negotiated            a tariff agreement with Bulgaria hoping to break the Austro-Hungarian            monopoly of its exports. In response to a diplomatic disagreement, Vienna            placed a punitive tariff on livestock, Serbias most important            export. Serbia, however, refused to bend, found new trade routes and            began seeking an outlet to the sea.\nIn 1908, Austria-Hungary            formally annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, frustrating Serbian designs            on those regions and precipitating an international crisis. The Serbs            mobilized, but under German pressure Russia persuaded Belgrade to cease            its protests. Thereafter, Belgrade maintained strict official propriety            in its relations with Vienna; but government and military factions prepared            for a war to liberate the Serbs still living under the Turkish yoke            in Kosovo, Macedonia and other regions.\nBalkan Wars and            the First World War\nThe Balkan Wars            and World War I had dramatic consequences for the South Slavs. In the            Balkan Wars, Serbia helped expel the Turks from Europe and regained            lands lost in medieval times. By 1914, the alliances of Europe and the            ethnic friction among the South Slavs had combined to make Bosnia the            ignition point, and Serbia one of the main battlegrounds, of World War            I. When Austria-Hungary collapsed after the war, fear of an expansionist            Italy inspired Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian leaders to form the new            federation known as Yugoslavia\nEthnic hatred, religious            rivalry, language barriers and cultural conflicts plagued the Kingdom            of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia)            from its inception. The question of centralization versus federalism            bitterly divided the Serbs and Croats; democratic solutions were blocked            and dictatorship was made inevitable because political leaders had little            vision, no experience in parliamentary government, and no tradition            of compromise. Hostile neighboring states resorted to regicide to disrupt            the kingdom, and only when European war threatened in 1939 did the Serbs            and Croats attempt a settlement. That solution, however, came too late            to matter.\nThe Kingdom of the            Serbs, Croats and Slovenes encompassed most of the Austrian Slovenian            lands, Croatia, Slavonia, most of Dalmatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Vojvodina,            Kosovo, the Serbian controlled parts of Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.            Territorial disputes disrupted relations with Italy, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania. Italy posed the most serious threat to Yugoslavia.            Although it received Zadar, Istria, Trieste and several Adriatic islands            in the postwar treaties and took Rijeka by force, Italy resented not            receiving all the territory promised under the 1915 Treaty of London.            Rome subsequently supported Croatian, Macedonian and Albanian extremists,            hoping to stir unrest and hasten the end of Yugoslavia. Revisionist            Hungary and Bulgaria also backed anti-Yugoslav groups.\nThe creation of            Yugoslavia fulfilled the dreams of many South Slavic intellectuals who            disregarded fundamental differences among 12 million people of the new            country. The Serbs, Croats and Slovenes had conflicting political and            cultural traditions, and the South Slav kingdom also faced sizable non-Slav            minorities, including Germans, Albanians, Hungarians, Romanians, and            Turks, with scatterings of Italians, Greeks, Czechoslovaks, Slovaks,            Ruthenians, Russians, Poles, Bulgars, Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews            and Romanies.\nThe Orthodox, Roman            Catholic, Islamic, Uniate, Jewish and Protestant faiths all were well            established and cut across ethnic and territorial lines. In addition            to the divisiveness of a large number of minority languages, linguistic            differences also split the Serbs, Croats, Slovenes and Macedonian Slavs.            Many people regarded the new government and its laws as alien, exploitative            and secondary to kinship loyalties and traditions.\nThe Serbs memories of their medieval kingdom, their 1389 defeat by the Ottoman            Turks, their 19th century uprisings, and their heavy sacrifices during            20th century wars contributed significantly to their feeling that they            had sacrificed much for Yugoslavia and received relatively little in            return.\nAfter the Second            World War\nAfter World War            II and German Nazi occupation, a socialist federation of Yugoslavia,            including Serbia, Montenegro and the other former Yugoslav territories,            was formed. Josip Broz Tito became the leader and remained in power            until his death in 1980.\nIn the late 1980s,            a passionate Serbian nationalist revival arose from this sense of unfulfilled            expectation, from the postwar distribution of the Serbs among various            Yugoslav political entities, and from perceived discrimination against            the Serbs in Kosovo in the 1970s and 1980s. In this process, the Serbian            Orthodox Church re-emerged as a strong cultural influence, and the government            of Serbia renewed celebrations of the memories of Serbian heroes and            deeds. These events caused leaders in Slovenia and Croatia to fear a            resurgence of the Serbian hegemony that had disrupted interwar Yugoslavia.\nThe Serbian-Albanian            struggle for Kosovo, the heartland of Serbias medieval kingdom,            dominated Serbias political life in the 1980s. Between 1948 and            1990, the Serbian share of Kosovos population dropped from 23.6            percent to less than 10 percent, while the ethnic Albanian share increased            in proportion because of a high birth rate and immigration from Albania.\nThe demographic            change was also the result of political and economic conditions; the            postwar Serbian exodus from Kosovo accelerated in 1966 after ethnic            Albanian communist leaders gained control of the province, and Kosovo            remained the most poverty-stricken region of Yugoslavia in spite of            huge government investments. After reasserting political control over            Kosovo in 1989, the Serbian government announced an ambitious program            to resettle Serbs in Kosovo, but the plan attracted scant interest among            Serbian emigres from the region.\nIn the republics            of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs situation was more            complex and potentially more explosive than in Kosovo. Despite denials            from the governments of both republics, Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia and            Herzegovina complained bitterly in the late 1980s about ethnically based            discrimination and threats. The Serbian government reacted with published            exposes of World War II atrocities against Serbs and the Croatian chauvinism            that had inspired them.\nMilosevic comes            to power\nIn July 1990, a            referendum was passed essentially removing the autonomous designations            from Kosovo and Vojvodina. Then, in November and December 1990, Slobodan            Milosevic was elected to the presidency. During 1991 and 1992, thousands            were killed during the civil war between the republics of former Yugoslavia.            In early 1992, United Nations peacekeeping troops were deployed to the            area to help quell the fighting in the region.\nIn the course of            1991-92, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina seceded from Yugoslavia            through violence, while Macedonia separated peacefully. The secessionist            republics quickly won international recognition. Serbia and Montenegro            chose to stay in Yugoslavia. At the joint session of the assemblies            of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro in Belgrade on Apr. 27, 1992, the            Serbs and Montenegrins adopted the constitution of the Federal Republic            of Yugoslavia.\nSince Serbia-Montenegro            was under de facto rule of President Milosevic, the army was under the            control of Milosevics ally, General Momcilo Perisic. No particular            opposition movement, including the Serbian Renewal movement or the semi-fascist            Serbian Radical Party, managed to offer a serious challenge to Milosevics            control. Indeed, when opposition leaders called for a non-confidence            vote in the government, Milosevic dissolved parliament and called for            new elections.\nMilosevics            regime was faced with trying to maintain political control of the volatile            and predominantly Albanian region of Kosovo, as well as the unstable            Sandzak Muslin enclave next to Bosnia. Interestingly, the Milosevic            administration had some degree of a challenge from then-Montenegrin            president, Momir Bulatovic, who, in the early 1990s, demonstrated an            increasingly independent pattern of policy making. At that time, several            Montenegrin members of Milosevics coalition in parliament resigned            in protest of Montenegros subordinate relations with Serbia.",

Kosovo              and later perhaps Montenegro would also become different nations.              But there was a time when all these people were one nation. There              were differences of language among them, but they were bound by one              faith – that of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nA cataclysmic event in the fourteenth century was seared into              their memory during which all of them paid the price of preserving              their national and cultural identity with blood and death. While              some survived to retain their original Eastern Orthodox Christian              character, some nations were not so fortunate. Centuries of              oppression by the Ottoman Turkish Jihadis made them sterile to              their ancient history and has changed their character today. While              today the Kosovars, Albanians and Bosnian Muslims remain European in              their appearance and in some aspects of their culture, they have              become Islamized to practice and propagate the faith of their              erstwhile tormentors.\n__________________\nA Serbian maiden gives water to thirsting knights on the              battlefield of Kosovo Polje.\nIn Serbian ”Kosovo Polje\" means a \"Blackbirds' Field”. But this Blackbirds' Field is also a field of death. And a              shrine for Serbian patriots who sacrificed their lives in defense of              their country, their culture and their freedom.\nJune 28, 1389, a mighty battle was fought at              Kosovo Polje. It pitted the Serbian defenders against the invading              Ottoman Empire (Turkey) adherents of the Muslim crescent moon.\nMedieval Europe was fretting and hoping that              the Serbs' would prevail over the Islamic crescent moon. At one              point, the bells of the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris rang out in              premature and erroneous salute to the Serbs' victory.\nBut it was not to be. The Serbs were defeated.              One of them, however, Milos Obilic, managed to cut the gut of the              invading Turkish Ottoman Emperor, Murat, with his sword, killing              him, before being cut to pieces himself by the Sultan's guards.\n________________\nIslam has cleaved a split in the cultural character of the Balkan              nations\nThe four centuries of Ottoman tyranny has left a split in the              cultural character of the Balkan nations, a split along which there              are bloody lines of civil and military strife among the people, all              of whom bore the brunt of Muslim tyranny. But some of whom have              forgotten that tyranny, by shifting their loyalty to their              tormentors, and today carry forward the banner of those tormentors,              while fighting against those of their compatriots, who have              preserved an unbroken link with their original culture, religion and              nationality.\nThe same situation prevails in the Indian subcontinent where              there is perpetual conflict between Hindus and Muslims within              India and the conflict between India and Pakistan whose              population is made up of Muslims who were formerly Hindus and              embraced Islam as a result of the tyranny of Muslim rulers who had              occupied the country for eight hundred years.\nIn India as in the Balkans, the period of Muslim occupation and              tyranny was marked by long drawn wars, and national struggles and              the people finally threw off the Muslim yoke, but in this process              spread over many centuries, many of the countrymen were forced by              cruel circumstances of Muslim oppression as Dhimmis (Zimmis) to give              up their ancestral faith, culture and nationality and go over to the              invaders by embracing Islam and saving their life, limb and the              honor of their womenfolk from the evil intentions of those              schizophrenic savages - the Muslims.\nThe irony is that these converts in Albania, Kosovo Bosnia or              Kashmir and Pakistan have totally forgotten who they originally were              and under what circumstances their ancestors were forced to embrace              that vile creed of Islam through a war imposed on them by the              Jihadis.\nOrigins of the Ottoman threat to Europe\nIn the early 1360s the Ottoman armies for the first time              invaded Europe by through Thrace and after a battle at a place named              Gallipoli they captured Adrianople (Edirne) and Philippopolis (Plovdiv),              forcing the Byzantines to pay tribute.\n__________________\nFor 600 years the battle of Kosovo Polje, the              Blackbirds' Field, has been seared into the hearts and minds of all              Serbs who are conscious of their history. Kosovo Polje to a Serb is              like Jerusalem, Alamo, Bastogne, and Siege of Leningrad (St.              Petersbrurg) - combined.\nOn June 28, 1989, the 600th anniversary of the              Battle of Kosovo, over a million Serbs, 10% of the nation, made a              pilgrimage to this sacred ground to pay their respects to the Kosovo              heroes.\n________________\n \nIn 1366 the count Amadeus VI of Savoy (cousin to John V              Cantacuzenus, the Byzantine emperor) initiated a minor crusade to              aid the Byzantines. The count drove away the Turks from all of              Europe except Gallipoli. The very next year the Ottoman chieftain              Murad attacked anew and regained most of Thrace, including              Adrianople.\nIn 1383 Murad declared himself sultan of the Ottoman Empire.              Shortly thereafter he again began a new campaign in Europe. Sofia,              the Bulgarian capital, fell in 1385 and the city of Niš the year              after. The Ottoman Conquest was halted briefly in 1387 when the              Serbs won the battle of Plocnik by delivering a crushing defeat on              the Ottomans. But two years later Murad marched anew into the west.\nThe Battle of Kosovo Polje – Turkish deception takes the victory              away\nDuring the early 1370s Murad launched his forces deeper into              Europe. At the river Maritsa they encountered a 70,000 man strong              Serbian-Bulgarian army under the Serbian king Vukasin and Prince              Lazar at the battlefield of Kosovo Polje. The ottoman army was              smaller, but due to tactics of subterfuge like attacking before              dawn, and poisoning the horses of the Serb-Bulgars they defeated the              Serb-Bulgar army and king Vukasin was killed.\nNow that the Serbian coalition was weakened by such a blow Murad              was quick to advance further into Bulgaria and capture the cities of Dráma, Kavála and Seres (Serrái). This is how the Ottomans snatched              a victory from the Serbs in the Battle of Kosovo Polje but the              Sultan Murad himself was killed by the valiant Serb warrior Miloš              Obilic.\nTo understand this battle in the context of Serbia, one must look              back to the 14th century when Kosovo was the center of the Serbian              empire and site of its most sacred churches and monasteries. In              1389, the Serbs lost the land of Kosovo and later Serbia to the              Ottoman Turks in a decisive battle fought in Kosovo Polje, the Field              of Blackbirds. The Battle of Kosovo is an event entrenched in the              Serbian, Montenegrin, Croatian (and all southern Slav) consciousness,              uniting all Serbs who treasure Kosovo as their Jerusalem, their holy              land.\n__________________\nGreat Serb Migration to flee from the Ottomans              in 1690. This painting by P. Jovanovic 1895 ”The Moving of the              Serbs,” portrays the Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Arsenije III              Carnojevic, surrounded by soldiers, flocks of sheep and women with              babies, leading some 36,000 families from his seat in Pec, Kosovo              and Southern Serbia to what is now Vojvodina and further into              Hungary in 1690, after Serbian revolts failed.\nUnder Milosevic, the Serbs tried to undo these              historical injustices by reclaiming the territory of Kosovo that              they had lost to the Ottomans who resettled Kosovo with Ottomans and              Kosovar Muslim converts from Albania\n________________\n \nAfter this battle, what is Kosovo and Albania today was occupied              by the Ottomans who unleashed a merciless tyranny on the people of              these lands. Over the next 500 years, the Ottomans forcibly              converted many Albanians to Islam and once the entire population was              converted, they forced these novice Muslim Albanians to leave their              homeland to settle in Kosovo to alter the demographic balance in              favor of Muslims and make the ethnic Christian Serbs a minority.\nThe Turks found the Illyrian Albanians easier to convert to Islam,              than the steadfast Serbs, and used these neo-converts to undermine              the Serbs.\nBy the time the Serbs reclaimed Kosovo in the Balkans Wars of              1912 to 1913, ethnic Muslim Albanian converts made up a significant              portion of the population. And by 1950 the Muslims became a majority              as their birth rate boomed due to the Islamic marital rules of              having four wives and endless children. This was compounded by the              continued Serb migrations north towards the Christian majority              lands. Today, 1.8 million Muslim Albanians outnumber Christian Serbs              nine to one in Kosovo – a fact that combined with events of recent              history give an opportunity for Albanians to proclaim Kosovo as              their land.\nBeyazid the Lightning Bolt’s revenge against the Serbs for his              father’s death in the Battle of Kosovo\nBeyazid I succeeded to the sultanship upon the death of his              father Murad in the battle of Kosovo. In a rage over the attack, he              ordered all Serbian captives killed; Beyazid became known as              Yildirim, the lightning bolt, for his temperament. He conquered most              of Bulgaria and northern Greece in 1389-1395 and laid siege to              Constantinople in 1391-1398. On September 25, 1396 at the Battle              of Nicopolis, his forces met the Venetian-Hungarian army along              with the Frankish knights led by king Sigismund of Hungary.\n__________________\nA Serbian Orthodox Church, cheek-by-jowl              alongside a Moslem Mosque in Urosevac, Kosovo. The Ottomans with              their Moslem Albanian allies who were Illyrian converts to Islam,              demolished churches and built mosques on their sites. In recognition              for their loyalty to their new Ottoman masters the Illyrian Muslim              converts from both from Albania proper and Kosovo, were given the              position of pashas and viziers by the Ottoman Turks.\nThe Turks found the Illyrian Albanians easier              to convert to Islam, than the steadfast Serbs, and used these              neo-converts to undermine the Serbs.\n________________\n \nThe Ottomans used their tactics of subterfuge by feigning to              negotiate with the Bulgarians and the Frankish knights and tricked              them into a trap to win Battle of Nicopolis. After which Beyazid              signed a peace treaty with Hungary. He then turned his attention to              the east, conquering the Turkish emirate of Karaman in 1397. This              emirate was a remnant of the Seljuks whom the Ottoman had displaced.              This emirate was an ally of the Byzantine empire and an enemy of the              Ottoman power.\nLessons from the Battle of Nicopolis\nAt Nicopolis, the Turks used techniques of hoodwinking the              Bulgarians and the French Knights into feigned negotiations and              luring them into a tap and then slaughtering them mercilessly. These              are techniques that are still used by the Jihadis in waving white              flags and then gunning down the American marines in Iraq, or of              using women and children as human shields to act as cover for the suicide bombers in Israel.\n__________________\nCelekula - The Tower of Skulls in Nis A tower              in which Turkish pasha used skulls of Christian Serbs as a building              material. The History of Ottoman Moslem rule in Serbia written by              Turkish historians gives a quite deceptive and dishonest picture of              Turkish tyranny it as an age of tolerance and peaceful coexistence              between Christians and Muslims in the Balkans.\nThis tradition of dishonesty and perfidy is              today carried forward by the Communists, liberals and other bedmates              of the islamofascists who march in droves yelling slogans against              Bush and the war on Terrorism. Such elements need to rounded up and              sent into internment camps as was done with the far more milder and              less dangerous Japanese Americans after the Pearl harbor attack.\n________________\n \nThe Jihadis still use foul means which they used against the              French Knights at Nicopolis. The knights, drawn from all over              Europe, had gone into battle assuming that they faced a fierce, but              honorable enemy. But with the massacre of the prisoners of war the              Europeans were reminded in 1396 at Nicopolis that they could              henceforth expect no mercy if captured by the invading Muslims, and              thousands were to meet their end in this brutal way. At Nicopolis              thousands of Christian soldiers who had laid down their weapons were              slaughtered in a bloodthirsty orgy lasting several hours after the              battle had ended. The opening of negotiations was normally used to              end hostilities or to stop hostilities from taking place. But the              subterfuge used at Nicopolis, with devastating effect, reminded the              Europeans yet again, that the Muslims were never to be trusted. That              the Muslims by instinct are a dishonorable people.\nThe Mongol Timurid Attack on Ottomans\nAround 1400 the Mongol leader Timur Lenk entered the Middle East.              Timur Lenk pillaged a few villages in eastern Anatolia. This              conflict with the Ottoman Empire exposed the soft underbelly of the              Ottomans. In August, 1400 Timur and his horde burned the town of              Sivas to the ground and advanced into the interior. The war              culminated at the Battle of Ankara in July, 1402. Timur won,              captured Beyazid, and was free to raid and pillage Anatolia. Beyazid              died in captivity in 1403.\nAlthough nominally Muslims, the Mongols sacked many Ottoman              cities and burned down Mosques to the ground in addition to their              mass slaughter of the Turkish civilian population. The neo-Muslim              Mongols under Timur carried forward the tradition of Hulagu Khan’s sack of Baghdad two centuries earlier in 1258.\nAfter the defeat at Ankara followed a time of total chaos in the              Ottoman Empire. Mongols roamed free in Anatolia and the political              power of the sultan was broken. After Beyazid was captured his              remaining sons, Suleiman Çelebi, İsa Çelebi, Mehmed Çelebi, and Mûsa              fought each other in what became known as the Ottoman Interregnum.\n__________________\nSt. Sava was the first Archbishop of Serbia who              lived in the 12th century (1172 – 1235). His relics (mortal remains              were preserved in the Basilica at Belgrade. To humiliate the Serbs              Sinan Pasha, the Ottoman Governor burnt the relics of St. Sava at              Vracar near Belgrade in 1594. Such humiliation and tyranny sparked              the Serb revolt against Turkish Tyranny. Many such revolts were put              down with mindless bloodshed. It was only when the Russians defeated              the Turks in the 17th century, that the condition of the Serbs could              be ameliorated from the merciless Turkish tyranny. tyranny.\n________________\nOf these sons of Beyazid, Mehmed Çelebi stood as victor in 1413              he crowned himself in Edirne (Adrianople) as Mehmed I. He set about              restoring the Ottoman Empire to its former glory. The Empire had              suffered hard from the Interregnum; the Mongols were still at large              in the east, even though Timur Lenk had died in 1405; and many of              the Christian kingdoms of the Balkans had broken free of Ottoman              control. The land, especially Anatolia, had suffered hard from the              war.\nDuring his reign, Mehmed moved his capital from Bursa to              Adrianople (Edirne), reinforced control over Bulgaria and Serbia,              drove the Mongols from Anatolia. Next, Mehmet invaded Albania,              Cilicia, the Seljuk Turkish emirate of Candar and Byzantine              controlled areas in southern Greece.\nOttomans Jihad against Venice\nWhen Mehmed died in 1421, one of his sons, Murad, became sultan.              Murad spent his early years on the throne disposing off rivals and              rebellions, most notably the revolts of the Serbs. In 1423 he paid a              short visit to Constantinople, laid siege on it for a couple of              months and forced the Byzantines to pay additional tribute.\n__________________\nThe monument to the fallen at the battle of Kosovo Polje. Kosovo              is to the Serbs what Jerusalem is to the Jewish people.\n________________\n \nIn 1423 the first regular Jihad against Venice (Italy) began. During Murad's siege of Constantinople, the Byzantine              Emperor's control over the Greek city-states was weakened. As Murad              II had been on peaceful terms with Venice the inhabitants of              Constantinople requested, Venetian troops to take control of the              city of Salonika (Thessaloniki). But the Ottoman army that laid              siege to the city seized this opportunity of troop movement and              killed several Venetian soldiers in cold blood. The Venetians deemed              the act in contravention with their peace treaty with the Ottomans              and declared full war.\nTurks try to defeat Venetians using subterfuge to conquer Salonika\nMurad acted swiftly, raised the siege of Constantinople and sent              his armies to Salonika. The Venetians had gained reinforcements by              sea and prepared for battle, but the Ottomans sent a delegation to              the Venetians to negotiate a peace. Using this subterfuge, the              Ottoman delegation reached the gate, asking for it to be opened and              for them to be let inside. On the Venetians refusal to open the              gates and asking for the leader of the Ottoman delegation to be              lifted into the fort over the walls, the Ottomans asked for time to              think over the proposal.\nFeigning to have a discussion, the Ottoman delegation assembled              below the gate and asked the Venetian guards stationed outside the              gate to step away so as to have a confidential discussion of the              terms the Venetians inside the fort had offered for parleys. With              the guards away, and the Ottomans having craftily got an opportunity              to get together without the watchful eye of the Venetians guards,              they slyly swooped on the guards and slew them in a swift              swordfight, before the guards inside knew what was happening outside              the gate and could react to it.\nThe Ottoman delegation, which was actually made up of Janissary              (Turkish Kamikaze troops, from Jan = Life and Nisar = Given Away)              fighters, seized the opportunity and set a raging fire to the heavy              wooden gate using naphtha balls. As the gate was burning from              outside, the Venetians inside were powerless to douse the flames              from inside and the water they threw from the top of the ramparts              could not reach the fire, due to gate being inside the turret on top              of it. Meanwhile the fire at the gate was a prearranged signal for              the Ottoman forces assembled a kilometer away to storm the gate.              Once the gate was burnt down, the outcome was given and the              Venetians fled to their ships.\nBut when the Turks entered and began plundering the city, the              Venetian fleet suddenly started bombarding the city from the              sea-side. The Ottomans fled and the fleet was able to hold off the              Ottomans until new Venetian reinforcements could arrive to recapture              the city.\nThe outcome of the Battle of Salonika was a setback for Murad and              when Serbia and Hungary allied themselves with Venice, the              young sultan was involved in one of the Ottoman Empire's worst              conflicts ever, with all odds against it.\nPope Martin V encouraged other Christian states to join the war              against the Ottomans, in answer to the Pope’s call Austria sent              troops to the Balkans. This defeat was a setback for the Ottoman              Jihad in the Balkans.\nRenewed War in the Balkans\nThe war in the Balkans resumed when the Ottoman army moved to              recapture Wallachia, which the Ottomans had lost to Mircea cel              Batran during the Interregnum and that now was an Hungarian vassal              state. As the Ottoman army entered Wallachia, the Serbs started              attacking the Ottomans stationed in Bulgaria and, at the same time,              urged by the Pope, the Anatolian emirate of Karaman attacked the              Empire from the rear. So Murad was compelled to split his army.\nThe main force went to defend Sofia and the reserves had to be              called to Anatolia. While the remaining Ottoman troops in Wallachia              were crushed by the Hungarian army that was now moving south into              Bulgaria where the Serbian and Ottoman armies battled each other.              The Serbs were defeated and the Ottomans turned to face the              Hungarians who fled back into Wallachia when they realized they were              unable to attack the Ottomans from the rear, as the Serbs were no              longer holding the Turks from the other side.\nMurad consequently, fortified his borders against Serbia and              Hungary but did not try to retake Wallachia, instead he sent his              armies to Anatolia where they defeated the Emirate of Karaman in              1428.\nIn 1430 a large Ottoman fleet attacked Salonika by surprise.              Unable to withstand the sustained Ottoman attacks, the desperate              Venetians signed a peace treaty in 1432. The treaty gave the              Ottomans the city of Salonika and the surrounding land. The war              between Serbia-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire continued in 1441 when              the Holy Roman Empire, Poland, Albania, and the emirates Candar and              Karaman intervened against the Ottomans.\nNiš and Sofia fell to the Christians in 1443 and the year after              the Ottomans suffered a major defeat in the Battle of Jalowaz. July              12, 1444 Murad signed a treaty that officially gave Wallachia and              the Bulgarian province of Varna to Hungary, western Bulgaria              (including Sofia) to Serbia. This defeat forced Murad to abdicate in              favor of his twelve-year-old son Mehmed.\nLater the same year the Christians seeing opportunity to throw              off the Ottoman tyranny attacked anew. But in November 11, 1444,              Murad defeated the Polish-Hungarian army of Janos Hunyadi at the              Battle of Varna.\n__________________\nRuins of a Serb Orthodox Church of the Holy              Virgin Odigitria, Musutiste built in 1315 which among the many that              were destroyed by the Ottomans during their four hundred years of              tyranny.\nIn the 14th century Kosovo was the center of              the Serbian empire and site of its most sacred churches and              monasteries. After 1389, when the Serbs lost the land to the Ottoman              Turks in a decisive battle fought in Kosovo Polje, the Field of              Blackbirds, the Turks systematically destroyed Christian churches in              Serbia and Croatia. The Battle of Kosovo is an event entrenched in              the Serbian, Montenegrin, Croatian (and all southern Slav)              consciousness, uniting all Serbs who treasure Kosovo as their              Jerusalem, their holy land.\n________________\nMurad was reinstated with the help of the Janissaries in 1446.              Another peace treaty was signed in 1448 giving the Empire Wallachia              and Bulgaria and a part of Albania to the Ottomans. After the Balkan              front was secured, Murad turned east and defeated Timur Lenk's son,              Shah Rokh, and the emirates of Candar and Karamn in Anatolia. He              died in the winter 1450-1451 in Edirne. Some have it that he was              wounded in a battle against Skanderbeg's Albanian guerilla.\nMehmed II, the Vandalizer of Constantinople\nMany doubted the young Mehmed II when he became sultan (again)              following his father's death. But by conquering and annexing the              emirate of Karaman (May-June, 1451) and by renewing the peace              treaties with Venice (September 10) and Hungary (November 20) he              proved his skills both on the military and the political front and              was soon accepted by the noble class of the Ottoman court. Although,              when he in 1452 proposed to attack Constantinople most of the divan,              and especially the Grand Vizier, Kandarli Halil, was against it and              criticized the sultan for being too rash and overconfident in his              abilities.\nOn April 15, 1452, Mehmed ordered the construction of a castle on              the shore of the Bosphorus. It was completed on August 31 and was              named the Rumeli Hiskari (the European Castle). In September, Mehmed              began mobilizing his troops, setting up a large camp surrounding the              city of Constantinople. On March 3, 1453, he presented the Byzantine              emperor Constantine XI with an ultimatum, but the emperor declined              to surrender the city. The Siege of Constantinople began on April 6              and lasted for almost three months. On May 29 the city was finally              captured by breaching one of its walls. Mehmed had the city’s              Christian (Greek) population put to the sword, nearly four fifths of              the city was burned down its magnificent Cathedrals turned into              rubble and some others into mosques, the Basilica of Hagia Sophia              was converted into a mosque in 1462 and the city was renamed as              Istambul (Islam-bul) and later became know by its modified name              Istanbul as it is known till today.\n__________________\nThe fall of Constantinople, opened the Balkan              nations to more depredations from the Turks. The Serbs revolted              against Turkish tyranny repeatedly during the four hundred years              from 1400. The Turks could maintain their stranglehold over Serbia              with their brute force leading to many bloodied waves of forced              migrations, incineration of villages, destruction of churches and              mass slaughter of the Serbian population.\n________________\n \nWhen Constantinople was captured and the Byzantine Empire              extinguished after resisting Islam for eight hundred years starting              from the Battle of Mu’ta in 629, Mehmed turned south to Morea (Pelleponessos)              where a last Greek kingdom still remained in Christian hands, and              west to the Balkans.\nThe fall of Constantinople, opened the Balkan nations to more              depredations from the Turks. In 1456 Mehmed laid siege to Belgrade.              On August 13 the Janissaries advanced into the city but were              ambushed and fled. Mehmed himself never succeeded in taking              Belgrade. But he entered Athens in 1460, until then ruled by emperor              Constantine's two brothers, Thomas and Demetrios. The following year              Mehmed launched a campaign into Anatolia defeating Sinope and              Armenia under Uzun Hasan before capturing the Empire of Trebizond              August 15, 1461.\nBut from here on the tide was to turn against the Jihad, till the              European armies not only pushed the Ottoman Turks out of Europe, but              British and French armies reached Egypt, Mesopotemia (which was              later divided in to Syria, Iraq and Transjordan) and what is today              called Saudi Arabia. The British held Transjordan as a mandate under              the League of Nations and the French held Syria and Lebanon as              another mandate.\nIt was in the British mandated Transjordan, where on the terms of              the Balfour Declaration the Jewish homeland of Israel was formed in              the Western half (or rather quarter) of Transjordan beyond the West              Bank of the Jordan river. The East Bank being the homeland for the              Arabs (Palestinians and Bedouins).\nThe European Counterattack on the Ottoman Jihad and the turning of              the tide of the Jihad back into Asia\nFor all their brutality and savagery, the Ottoman Turks failed to              keep up technologically with their European rivals, especially              Russia. The Turks suffered a huge naval loss at the Battle of              Lepanto in 1571. After its defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683,              the Ottoman Empire began a journey decline, culminating in the              defeat of the empire by the Allies in World War I. After the              great defeat of the Ottomans at Vienna, Austria, Prince Eugene              of Savoy lead Austrian forces to further victories. By 1699, the              whole of Hungary had been conquered from the Ottomans by the              Austrians.\n__________________\nThe fortress of Novo Brdo was the largest              Serbian town in Kosovo. The Turks vandalized it and reduced it to              ruins as they did with innumerable towns, villages and monasteries              in Serbia and other parts of the Balkans. The photo on the top is              how the fortress looks today and an artist’s impression of the              fortress during its heyday before the Turkish aggression of Serbia.\n________________\n \nFinal Defeat of the Ottoman Jihad in Europe during WW1\nItaly declared war on the Ottoman Empire on September 29, 1911,              demanding the turnover of Tripoli and Cyrenaica. When the empire did              not respond, Italian forces took those areas on that November 5              (this act was confirmed by an act of the Italian Parliament on              February 25, 1912). Three years later on November 5, 1914 the United              Kingdom annexed Cyprus, and together with France declared war on the              Ottoman empire.\nThe final end to the aged and crippled empire came in the First              World War. Close relations with Germany and the continued enmity              towards Russia pushed the empire into joining the Central Powers.              The British supported revolt of the Arabs, who lead by T. E.              Lawrence (of the “Lawrence of Arabia” fame) defeated the Ottoman              forces in the Middle East.\nAt the end of the war the Ottoman government collapsed completely              and the empire was divided amongst the victorious powers. France and              Britain got most of the Middle East while Italy and Greece were              given much of Anatolia. At the same time an independent Armenian              state was established in eastern Turkey, and an autonomous Kurdish              area was also created. The Serbs and Croats meanwhile brought              together all the Southern Slavs to form a single nation named              Yugoslavia.\nThe Balkan Slavs and Albanian Illyrians who had converted to Islam              during Ottoman rule wee now a problem\nBut with freedom from Ottoman rule came an additional factor to              account for. Amidst the Slavs there were many who had converted to              Islam during the intervening five centuries of the Ottoman Jihad in              Europe. These Slavic and Illyrian converts to Islam did not fully              identify with the independence of their homeland from Turkish rule.\nMany of them secretly plotted for Turkish rule to return. And              when this seemed impossible they nurtured within themselves the              notion that as Muslims (although Slavs like Alija Izetbegovic), they              were a distinct nation. This feeling was not erased by the six              decades of Communist rule under Marshal Tito (the Croatian Strongman              who held Yugoslavia together).\nThe Muslim Slavs of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Muslims Illyrians              of Albania and Kosovo fomented a rebellion that broke into an              insurrection against the Slavs (Serbs and Croats) to break away and              form separate Muslim nations. It is just a matter of time till they              declare themselves to be “Islamic Republics” of Albania, Kosovo and              Bosnia. As a reaction to this the Christian Slavs were forced into a              defensive war to preserve the unity of their nations.\nSlobodan Milosevic represents the national aspirations of all the              Southern Slavs\nSlobodan Milosevic represents the national aspirations of all the              Southern Slavs to reverse the historical wrongs done to their nation              by the Ottoman Jihadis. He too made mistakes with regard to the              Croats and Slovenes. But the bridge at Mostar is a symbol of the              common adversary of the Serbs and Croats. Many will say he killed              innocent Muslim Men, women and children at Srebrenica. Killing is              always bad, but then how can those who believe and practice a creed              that calls for the murder of others be called innocent? Srebrenica              and Sarajevo were in self-defense, as are Ramadi and Fallujah, Jenin              and Jericho.\nThe Court at the Hague has failed to deliver its judgment on              Slobodan, but the judgment of history that will be delivered after              the dust of the War on Terror settles, will be that Slobodan was in              the line of Heros who fought to reverse the Islamic Jihad. He shares              honors with Charles Martel, Richard the Lionheart and Jan Sobieski.\nThe campaigns that were described as ethnic cleansing, were those              that followed the age-old European Christian tradition of remaining              steadfast in face of a beastly Muslim attack, occupation, tyranny.              After the first vicious Muslim attack, the European Christians were              initially beaten back and bewildered. This happened with the              Christians when they first encountered the Muslim Jihad in              Mesopotamia in the 7th century, when the Muslims overran              Jerusalem in 634, along with Cesaria and Damascus.\nThe subterfuge in war of Muslim soldiers dressing up as women and              attacking the bemused Christian Byzantine soldiers at the battle of              Hieryomak (Al Yarmuk), followed by the mass slaughter of the              civilian population especially at Cesaria, so seared the memory of              the Byzantine Christians that they took some time to find their              feet.\nThis was so, as in no time in Human history had any invader been              so inhuman, like the Muslims. But once the Byzantine Christians had              gauged their adversary as sub-human schizophrenic savages that they              were, the Christians returned every barbarity with equally ferocity.              The same was true for the Spanish Christians (Visigoths) who were              first overrun by the Moors in 711. After the Muslim subterfuge              they were victims of in the battle of Guadelete in Southern Spain,              and the grisly sight of the head of their King Roederic (Rodrigo)              being stuck on a spear and paraded before the Christian soldiers to              break their spirit, the Spanish too learnt the kind of beastly enemy              they faced in the Muslims. And they returned the favour to the              Muslims in equal measure during the Reconquista. In fact the              Reconquista, the Inquisition, and the Crusades all were a              result of this unnervingly brutal experience of the Europeans at the              hands of the beastly Jihadis.\nThose who did not learn this lesson were to be extinct as were              the Christians of North Arabia, Sinai, Egypt, Syria, Palestine,              Anatolia (Turkey), North Africa, Nubia, (North Sudan), as              also the Zoroastrians of Iran, Baluchistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,              Turkmenistan, the Buddhists of Afghanstan, Chinese Turkestan (Xinkiang),              Kazakastan, the Hindus of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kashmir, the nature              and idol worshipping Arabs of Saudi Arabia, and many other unnamed              people who are extinct today and whose descendants survive as robots              trapped in the mental prison of Islam.\nThe Serbs under Milosevic, only tried to reclaim what was              historically originally theirs in the only way possible with the Muslim - with that of blood and death. The Muslims understand no              other language. If humanity and our civilization are to be              emancipated from the Muslim threat, then the only way out is to              match and outmatch the Muslims at their gameplan, in their methods              of war, in their cruelty, their pervasiveness, persistence,              foresight, deception, subterfuge, hate for the adversary and all              other departments of the war.\nWe cannot fault the Serbs for what those with a faint heart, or              those with a sneaking sympathy of the Muslims, or those who nurture              paranoid fright of the Muslims, decry and moan as “Ethnic              Cleansing of the Muslims” In fact this “Cleansing” has to be              done, and will be done, across the globe after the first Muslim              nuclear attack on the West that unfortunately is coming soon with              Iran on the way to becoming a nuclear power and Pakistan already one              that can be taken over by the Jihadis through a coup against the              ruling nominally pro-American strongman Pervez Musharraf.\nNATO attacks on Serbia under the Dhimmicratic (Democratic) Bill              Clinton\nThe sad part of Serbia’s chapter was motivated by the misplaced              Western belief of trying to appease the Muslims, by winning their              hearts and minds through a show of fair-play. It was this warped              mentality that was the basis of the NATO policy of bombing Serbia to              punish it for trying to reclaim its lost province of Kosovo.\nThe Dhimmicratic Bill Clinton, who disgraced our Presidency by              doing what he did with Monica Lewinsky, tried to distract world              attention from his escapades at the Oval Office, by attacking Serbia              on behalf of the Kosovar Muslims and carve a place for himself in              history.\nThe American led bombing of Serbia was an act of supreme stupidity              that came home to roost on 9/11\nNot only did we not win the hearts of the Muslim Ummah, but              showed ourselves as dangerous nannies acting on behest of the Muslim              murderers. Yes the Muslims were being hounded out of Kosovo, but              they had hounded out the Serbs in 1690, to forcibly occupy the              province and Islamize it for their Turkish Ottoman overlords. Do the              Serbs not have a Right of Return to their lands occupied by the              Muslims. In fact do not all non-Muslims have the Right of Return to              the lands that the Muslims have overrun, starting from Makkah              (Mecca) in the year 630?\nThe Dhimmicratic Bill Clinton who led America on to a fools              errand to show the Muslim murderers, how fair and just he was, is an              act that will haut our nation’s conscience forever, till we redeem              this folly by destroying Islam. Which we will do, unless we want to              be destroyed by the Muslims.\nGeorge Bush has jettisoned Clinton’s Serbia Policy\nHave we noticed that in his two Presidential terms, good ole              George has not mentioned his predecessors’ bombing adventure of              Serbia at all in any of his speeches. George has not favored Kosovo              with a visit, as did Bill. This is a telling message that the              Republican administration disapproves of the Dhimmicratic stupidity              of bombing a potential ally in favor of a confirmed enemy!\nIslam, Fanatic Islam and Islamic Terrorism\nToday many the world over are innocent of how Islam was founded,              how it grew and what Islam implies for the future of Humankind. So              there are endless debates that Islam is a religion of peace, that              all Muslims are not fanatical, and that we need to differentiate              between, Muslims and terrorists.\nThe reading of the story of Islam so far should be enough to              dispel the notion that Islam differs from Islamic fanaticism, or              that Islam is a religion of peace and that the Terrorists have              hijacked a peaceful religion. No it is not. It is Islam which gave              birth to Terrorism, which started from the evil mind of its founder              Mohammed (yimach shmo ve-zichro - may his name and memory be              obliterated) and has filtered down to the last follower (Muslim)              today. Islam is Fanaticism, it is high time we woke up to this              chilling reality.\nHow Islam prevents Muslims from leaving Islam – Murder any Muslim              leaving Islam\nMohammed (yimach shmo…) was a shrewd man who knew that there was              always a danger of Muslims deserting Islam and reverting to some              other less blood-thirsty religion, so he made it an offense              punishable with death for anyone leaving Islam, having once accepted              it. According to the Shariah, a Murtad (Muslim Apostate) has to be              killed, and it is the duty of a Muslim to kill any other Muslim who              leaves Islam.\nThe murderous Quran is the inviolable word of god\nThere can also never ever be any discussion on the murderous              commands of the Quran, since it is the word of god, or so Mohammed (yimach              shmo ve-zichro - may his name and memory be obliterated) told his              followers.\nAssemble five times a day to swear your loyalty to Islam\nTo be doubly sure that his flock remains together in to its              murderous ken (prison), he decreed that it was compulsory for all              Muslims to come together and pray five times during the day. So              there wasn’t any chance for his followers to leave Islam and              emancipate themselves.\nGetting into Islam was a one way street.\nIslam was a dead end, where you could enter, (in fact you were              forced to enter at the pain of death) , but could never leave, since              you would be killed. In fact such was the indoctrination and mass              hysteria that Mohammed (yimach shmo…) started, that in a generation              or so, the new converts forgot that their forefathers were not              Muslims, and in fact in North Africa, they even forgot that they              were not Arabs. They forgot that their forefathers were made to              submit to Islam at the pain of death.\nThis sealed the fate of all those who were forced to embrace              Islam from ever becoming decent thinking humans ever again.\n \nOnly the total destruction of non-Muslim heritage and              wholesale slaughter of non-Muslims has got the Muslims Victory\nWith every Muslim military victory, there was not just a change              of ruler, but a wholesale slaughter of those who refused to convert              or pay Jaziya. There was also a total destruction of the pre-Islamic              culture, educational institution, libraries, etc. The planned and              deliberately implemented slaughter of the non-Muslim priestly and              warrior class was done to enfeeble the conquered populace so much              that they would forget who they were their national and cultural              identity be subsumed under a newly imposed Arabized Muslim identity.\nThis kind of tyranny was never known to the human race, with any              other conqueror, like Alexander, Julius Caesar, Hannibal, or even              those who came after the Muslims like the British Colonialists, or              the Spanish Conquistadors. Yes the Spanish Conquistadors were              ruthless, but in spite of all they did to he native Americans, the              naïve Americans still have preserved their memory of they being a              people different from the Spanish Conquistadors, not so with the              Egyptians, North Africans, Berbers, et al.\nAsk any Egyptian who he is, he will say he is an Arab, were the              Pharaohs Arabs? Were the builders of the Pyramids, Arab? Ask any              Libyan, Sudanese, Algerian, Tunisian, Somalian, who he is he will              say he is an Arab. These are people, whom the conquering Muslim              Arab, so Arabized that they have forgotten who they are, their              national identities have completely been submerged into the Arab              Muslim Ummah.\nThis has not happened with the native Americans or the Maoris or              the Africans, in spite of the fact that apartheid was practiced in              South Africa. The Arabs as conquerors totally brainwashed at the              point of the sword all the conquered people, Arabized and Islamized              them at the pain of death.\nKnowing all this is relevant today for those who seek to defeat              Islam. To do so we have to first understand the depth of depravity              in Islam. If the Muslims have to be saved from Islam, then it is not              sufficient to conquer the Muslim countries and try to being              democracy to them, we have to de-Islamize these people, if they are              to be emancipated into civilized beings.\nIslam has brutalized them and made them robotic followers and              into robotic killers, narrow-minded individuals, despotic rulers,              and cruel sadists by following the injunctions of the Instruction              Manual of Terrorism (the Quran). This is proven by the bloodied              Shiite-Sunni murders that have started in Iraq despite elections,              and elections by people who support a murderous creed throw up              murders as their legislators as in the case of Hamas and the rise of              the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.\nIslam is a perverted mentality, a mental sickness based on              intimidation to convert all non-Muslims to Islam, and to murder if              you refuse to convert. And if you manage to save your head, then you              have to live under their dehumanizing tyranny and live as              non-Muslims (Dhimmis or Zimmis).\nThe Retrograde Negative Spirit of Islam pervades all across that              Islamic civilization(sic). Although to call it “civilization” is a              contradiction in terms\nThe very first verse uttered by that lecherous mass-murderer, the              accursed Mohammed-ibn-abdallah was “La Ilah Il Allah, Mohammed ur              Rasoolallah” which translated literally would read “No god but god,              Mohammed is prophet of god”. In Arabic “La” connotes “No”. So what              can one expect from a mentality whose very first of its five              principles is based on negativism?\nNegativism permeates all through Islam, its attitudes towards all              non-Muslims, its use of dishonesty to portray itself as a victim,              its murderous intent towards all those who refuse to convert to              Islam, its use of any level of cruelty to Islamize entire humankind.\nWe can save ourselves from this Malignant Madness of Islam, only              if we see it through to its grave. The other option is landing in              the grave ourselves along with liberty, progress and free-thinking,              freedom of speech and scientific advancement, all of which will be              become slaves to that Instruction Manual of Hate and Terror – the              Quran.\nWhy is a threat of death the only way to defeat Islam?\nIslam was spread with the use of death threats. The defeated              non-Muslims were given the choice of Islam or Death. After having              been forced to accept Islam through such terminal coercion, the              converted people had no way of renouncing Islam. If they did so,              they were targeted as Murtads (apostates) and were killed. It is              mandatory in Islam for Muslims to kill anyone who leaves the cult.              So the converts were forced to remain Muslims. And as this was their              fate, then the best bet for them was to imbibe the murderous              attitude themselves and impose it on others.\nToday although \"Islam or Death\" is not possible openly, unless              you live in Muslim ruled countries of the Islamic crescent like              Egypt, Sudan, Iran, Pakistan or in areas contiguous to Muslim              majority areas like Malaku in Indonesia, Southern Sudan, Kashmir,              North Nigeria.\nMuslim converts today are convicts or psychological wrecks like Jose              Padilla and Richard Reid\nBut the Muslims have devised ingenious methods to reach those              best suited for Islam, so they evangelize in Prisons, where they can              appeal to the dregs of society, or those come from broken families,              those who have gone through divorces, or those who have had some              heart-breaking personal experience.\nIt is on the emotions of such unfortunate wrecks and irredeemable              convicts that these Muslim missionaries prey like vultures and              hyenas to make them join the murderous ranks of Islam. Richard Reid,              the Shoe bomber, Jose Padilla are specimen of those who become              Muslim today.\nThe cardinal fact is that across the fourteen centuries of              Islam’s existence, it has been its death threat that made people              Muslim and it was the same death threat that kept them Muslim. The              same death threats are used today to intimate Ayan Hirsi Ali, Salman              Rushdie and many others like them to keep them from speaking the              truth about Islam.\nHe who was born by the sword shall die by the sword\nModifying the age-old adage “He who lives by the sword shall die              by the sword.” We can say that “Islam which was born by the sword              shall die by the sword” As it was a death threat that made people              into Muslims and kept them as Muslims, the only way these scum can              be shaken out of their adherence to the savagery called Islam is a              death threat. Not individual death threats as the Muslims hurl today              at Hirsi and Salman, but a death threat of extermination through a              nuclear holocaust of the entire Muslim population across the globe!\nOnly when the beastlike Muslims see the determination of a world              to do them in, upto their last man and woman, can the Ummah of Islam              be smashed.\nWhen the Muslims see that there is no option other than death, if              they persist in remaining Muslim, will the fort of Islam be breached              and once the first trickle of Muslims who renounce Islam starts, the              trickle will turn into a flood and an avalanche that will wipe out              Islam.\nYes there will certainly be many Muslims who will try to kill              those who renounce Islam, but when these murderers are themselves              hunted down with equal ferocity, will the lay Muslims believe that              it is safe for them to give up Islam. Then and only then, shall we              see Muslims coming over in droves to give up Islam. But this can              happen only we seriously hurl and start executing a death threat of              mass killing of all Muslims across the globe. There are no soft              options here.\nDo we have it in us to do that?\nThe answer decides whether civilization wins or Islam wins!\n_____________________________\nSelect Bibliography\nJihad in the West: Muslim Conquests from the              7th to the 21st Centuries (Hardcover) by Paul Fregosi\nThe Sword of the Prophet: History, Theology,              Impact on the World by Srdja Trifkovic\nIslam Unveiled: Disturbing Questions About the              World's Fastest Growing Faith by Robert Spencer\nStudies in Muslim Apocalyptic Literature              (Studies in Late Antiquity and Early Islam) by David Cook\nWhy I Am Not a Muslim by Ibn Warraq\nOnward Muslim Soldiers by Robert Spencer\nEurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis by Bat Ye'Or\nIslam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations              Collide by Bat Yeor\nWhat the Koran Really Says: Language, Text, and              Commentary by Ibn Warraq\nIslam and Terrorism: What the Quran Really              Teaches About Christianity, Violence and the Goals of the Islamic Jihad by Mark A.

In this timeline called Timeline Heliopolis, the Serbs had won the Battle of Kosovo instead of the Ottomans.\nAfter the Turkish counterattack aimed at the Serb heavy armor that was charging at the Turkish wing command, the Serbian forces regrouped at the upper hill that overlooked the battlefield, and harassed the incoming Ottoman army. Repeated Serb counter attacks had led to the Ottoman forces retreating from Kosovo all the way into northern Greece.\nWith the Serb victory at Kosovo, they were now in a better position to counter the Hungarian invasion that was looming over the border. Eventually, the Kingdom of Hungary saw the strength that the Serbs had demonstrated over the Ottoman armies.\nSerbian Expansion\nWith the Serbs having won the Battle of Kosovo and the decision of the Hungarian Kingdom not to invade from the north, The Serbian Empire flourished for the past century. However, the exploration of the New World hasn't escape its attention, which led to the explorations of present day North America and much of South East Asia. Before the exploration, the Serbian Empire united with the Kingdom of Montenegro, acquiring access to the sea. The Serbian Empire also included all of Macedonia and Greece, both territories that were formerly under Ottoman rule.\nThe first acquisition of Serbia's first colony occurred after its role in the alternate Spanish-Serbian War in 1764, after the Seven Years War. The Kingdom of Spain, wrecked by its defeat in the Seven Years War after the British occupied Cuba and the Philippines, faced another threat. This time, the Serbs had challenged Spanish superiority at the naval Battle of the Mediterranean, which Spain narrowly won. Although Serb naval power was weak at that time, it eventually grew thanks to British support, who at first supported Serbian ambitions after its contributions in the Seven Years War. Serbia's colony however, was the Gibraltar colony which would eventually be under British control. However, Britain's naval superiority was threatened by the expansion of more Serbian fleets anchored in the port of Bar in the Adriatic.\nFirst Defeat\nYear 1768 was the worst year for Serbia, which went to war with Britain over control of the Balkans. Britain's objective in the Anglo-Serbian war was the free access to Africa via the Balkans. The conflict also drew in the Hungarian Kingdom, which occupied Croatia.\nBritain's first victory in the Balkans was at the Battle of Podgorica, when the British army overran Serb positions stationed in the city. The war also drew in the Russian Empire, anxious to get its revenge for its loss in the Seven Years War. Russian forces had invaded the Hungarian Kingdom, and defeated the Hungarian army at the outskirts of Budapest. British gains were rapid, occupying Nis, as well as other cities and towns. However, Britain's first defeat of the war was at the Battle of Belgrade. The battle in the Serbian capital was bloody and brutal, plus frequent harassment form native resistance groups operating in the city. Eventually, Belgrade was overrun by British forces.\nFor the first time in almost three centuries, Serbia was occupied by a foreign power. The Anglo-Serbian War ended in a British triumph, which occupied Serbia, as well as Croatia and Bosnia from the Hungarian Kingdom. Russia once again lost the war to its possible rival, having been denied the chance for access to a warm water port. Now, Britain has control of the Balkans, as well as South East Asia and North America, having defeated Spain, France and Serbia in a conflict that gave a rise to the British Empire.\nRevenge\nThe opportunity for revenge occurred when the colonists in the Thirteen Colonies rebelled against Britain in 1775. Serbia took advantage of this opportunity to resume its resistance against British occupation by assassinating a British Deputy Assistant to the military governor at the time.\nStruggling for independence was the vocal point of the British-occupied territories and colonies' goal of driving its imperial masters out of its own territory. During the American Revolution, particularly in the late stages of the conflict, Serbia and Croatia sent volunteers to fight the British, until they were defeated in 1783. During that time, Serbia and Croatia were respectively liberated by the incoming Russian army, who entered the revolution on the side of its South Slav brothers.\nNapoleonic Age\nSerbia pretty much stayed out of the conflict in the early stages of the Napoleonic Wars. However, with the French Empire starting to encroach Croatian territory, Serbia almost went to war with France. It wasn't until the French invasion of Spain that Serbia started to invade Spanish held Philippines. With Spain busy fighting off French occupation, Serbia quickly drove off the Spanish at the Battle of Vigan.\nNearly at the end stages of the Napoleonic Wars, Serbia turned against France in its opportunity to rekindle relations with Britain and Austria, who were both smarting from the loss of the control of the Balkans.\nImperial Serbia\nWith Serbia's acquisition of the Philippines in 1815, the Serbs then proceeded to control Indochina, which consists of present day Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. However, Serbia got into a war with the Netherlands over the Dutch East Indies in the Serbo-Dutch War of 1825. The aftermath of the victory in which Serbia earned gave rise of the South Slavic empire in South East Asia.\nSerbia consolidated its control of its colonies further by expanding its economic development, particularly in the islands of Sumatra and Java in present-day Indonesia, and Manila in the Philippines.\nWith Croatia free from foreign control, it too started to seek colonies for its growing stable economy. However, Croatian ambitions clashed with Serbian ambitions, which came close to war. Luckily, both nations were too weary from the wars that they had to wage in order to survive.\nAmerican Civil War\nWhen the American Civil War erupted, Serbia and Croatia first stayed neutral in the early stages. The reason for that was because both nations were threatened by Britain and France to stay out of the conflict, or face consequences.\nHowever, the threat didn't keep Serbia from contributing its forces to primarily Union forces. Croatia didn't contribute any forces at all, instead it kept alert for any possible future conflict with Britain. But the aftermath of the American Civil War ended with a Confederate victory, and Britain was poised to invade Serbia once again, only this time at its colonies.\nSecond Anglo-Serbian War\nThe attack on Manila harbor was known to Serbian authorities, who were planning this conflict after the disastrous event during the American Civil War. In 1866, Britain invaded the Philippines once again. The first invasion was almost a hundred years ago. This time, Serbia went fully prepared for the combat. The war would have gone longer had not the Russian Empire intervened on its South Slavic partner's side.\nWhen the war was over, Britain was forced to pay reparations to Serbia and Russia in goods as a result of its defeat in the Anglo-Serbian War. The timely intervention of Russia at the Battle of the Mekong River had proved to the British that it needed a partner quickly.\nNew Empires Emerge\nIn 1867, during the Anglo-Serbian War, the Austrian Empire had managed to unite with the Kingdom of Hungary, creating the Austro-Hungarain Empire. Germany had emerged in 1870 as a result of unification. Its first victory in combat resulted in the Franco-Prussian War, in which France lost. Italy also emerged back in 1866, and were planning an alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary.\nGerman fears of a powerful Serbia was already realized when it witnessed its industrial power in its South East Asian colonies during the peak of its economic boom in 1887. Austria-Hungary also feared Serbian domination of the Balkans when Croatia refused to accept a proposal for a three way monarchy between Austria, Croatia and Hungary. Croatia at this time had annexed Bosnia, and Serbia campaigned to capture the region of Vojvodina.\nJapan also became a merging power back in 1877, after the US helped modernize its army. Serbia, wanting to also modernize its army, also asked the US for help. As a result, a US-Serbia treaty had came into effect. Russia also was aware of what was happening in the Balkans, and signed a treaty with Serbia.\nSerbia and Croatia planned to be neutral in any case a future conflict broke out, but with Britain planning on joining the Triple Alliance as well as CSA, they may not have much choice. The Second American Civil War broke out in 1890, with the CSA winning it once again. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 was contested over the control of Korea and Manchuria, in which Japan won. However, Japan also lost its first modern war during the Serbo-Japanese War as a sign of retaliation for Serbia's support for Russia in the Russo-Japanese War. The Serbo-Japanese War was fought over Serbia's South East Asian colonies, in which the victor had kept control.\nThe planned alliance between Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Japan couldn't be realized because Britain was more concerned about France and the Confederate States being potential enemies if it joined with Germany. The United States also couldn't join Germany's side, for fear of losing support of its Slavic allies. So, a three way alliance was formed with Britain, France and the Confederate States being the Triple Entente, Germany, Austria-Hungary,and Turkey being the Triple Alliance, and the United States, Russia, Japan, Serbia and Croatia being the Big Five Powers. During the 1900's, former Ottoman Empire territories had already broken away with support of Serbia and Russia. As a result, Romania and Bulgaria became independent and joined the Big Five Powers as minor members. Italy later joined the Big Five Powers as a belligerent in 1910.\nWorld War One Heliopolis Timeline\nSerbia had covertly planned the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo while on a state visit to Croatia. Like in the real time line, Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for the assassination, and sent an ultimatum. When Serbia refused to accept the ultimatum, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. The Russian Empire then mobilized its troops and declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Germany did the same thing and declared war on Russia. Japan also mobilized and declared war on Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. At first, Britain and France would sit this conflict out, but the desire to get revenge on the United States, Serbia, Russia and Germany proved too much to handle, and declared war on the Big Five Powers as well as the Triple Alliance (Central Powers). The Confederate States also declared war on both the Triple Alliance and the Big Five Powers with the opportunity to defeat the United States once again.\nThe first conflict started with the Austrian bombardment of Belgrade in September 1914. However, the siege had to be broken off because of Russian offensives poised to attack Transylvania. Germany then proceeded to attack France through Belgium, and Britain sent re-inforcements.\nGermany signed a pact with the Qing Empire of China, but revolutions in which the Kuomintang was first born made it impossible for the Kaiser to send aid to its Asian ally. Japan then proceeded to attack German held territories in China at the Battle of Tsingtao in November 1914.\nSerbia faced a massive invasion bu the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the Battle of Cer in 1915, in which Serbia won but suffered huge losses. However, Austrian, German and British mobilization had a huge effect on Serbia when they were defeated in October 1915, with Belgrade occupied. Serbia almost collapsed until Russian reinforcements prompted the opposing sides to fight the huge but ill equipped Russian army.\nCroatia then staged an invasion of the Austrian half of the Austro-Hungarian Empire when the Austro-Hungarian army suffered a defeat by Russia in the Battle of the Masurian Lakes. However, Russian weaknesses that were facing its army proved to be futile when Germany scored major victories over Russia. In the Balkans, Croatia then suffered a defeat by the Austrian troops.\nBritain then also invaded Croatia and Serbia from its overseas territory in Egypt through the Adriatic Sea. When Croatia and Serbia were on the verge of collapse, and Russia on the defensive, Japan sent troops to help with the Balkan Front. This move brought into conflict between Japan and the Ottoman Empire with the Japanese Navy defeating the Turkish Navy at the naval Battle of the Persian Gulf.\nJapanese troops also scored victories against the Austro-Hungarian armies in the Serbo-Japanese offensive at the Battle of Kosovo in March of 1916.\n1917 was the year of huge losses when the Russian Army had to defend their homeland.",
                "National Geographic Magazine - NGM.com\nMap: Scattered Serbs »\nSome of the village churches, Bojan Nakalamic says, were built during the reign of King Stefan Dusan in the 14th century. The greatest ruler the Serbs ever had, he built a Serbian empire larger than any before or since. Kosovo was at its center when Dusan dubbed himself \"Emperor and Autocrat of the Serbs and Greeks, the Bulgarians and the Albanians.\"\nChuckling, but with his hand on his heart, Nakalamic says: \"Outside, I'm a small Kosovo politician. But inside, I'm Dusan.\"\nOnly a few decades after Dusan's death, in 1389, an army of perhaps 25,000 Serbs met a superior Ottoman force on Kosovo Field and went down in what many Serbs regard as glorious defeat. Serbia withered in the face of the expanding Ottoman Empire, which erased the country from the map within little more than a century. But the Battle of Kosovo lived on in Serbian literature and song as a symbol of the struggle against foreign domination.\nSerbia regained independence in the 19th century and retook Kosovo in the 20th, during the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Yet several centuries of Turkish domination had not only shaped the Serbs' sense of persecution, but also scattered them across the western Balkans. At the close of the 20th century, the tides of history turned again with the collapse of Yugoslavia. Many of the descendants of those who had fled Ottoman rule came surging back, adding a new chapter to the story of Serbian suffering.\nThe slight twist, which those familiar with Slavic given names might have guessed, is that Tanic is himself a Serb. Like several thousand other Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo, Tanic took up arms against the Serb forces that laid siege to the city soon after Bosnia declared inde­pendence from Yugoslavia in 1992. Under the cir­cum­stances, religious heritage mattered less than who was shooting at him. \"They were attacking my home, and if someone attacks my home, I defend it.\"\nBut he was in the minority. Other Bosnian Serbs—unwilling to live in a country where Bosnian Muslims, or Bosniaks, would dominate—elected to fight Bosnian independence. They controlled the arsenal of the Yugoslav Peo­ple's Army and overran 70 percent of Bosnia in the first months of the war, forcing non-Serbian populations out of the land they conquered. The order of the day was to clean the territory of large, troublesome minority popula­tions unsuitable for inclusion in a unified Serbia.\nPage [ 5 ] of 9"

                "Strabismus  is a condition that interferes with binocular vision because it prevents a person from directing both eyes simultaneously towards the same fixation point; the eyes do not properly align with each other. Heterotropia is a medical synonym for the condition. Colloquial terms for strabismus include \"cross-eye\", \"wall-eye\", and a \"cast of the eye\".  In British English it is sometimes referred to as a \"squint\",  though that word more broadly is a verb meaning 'to narrow the eye opening',  not related to strabismus.\n\nStrabismus typically involves a lack of coordination between the extraocular muscles, which prevents directing the gaze of both eyes at once to the same point in space; it thus hampers proper binocular vision, and may affect depth perception adversely. Strabismus is primarily managed by ophthalmologists, optometrists, and orthoptists. Strabismus is present in about 4% of children. Treatment should be started as early as possible to ensure the development of the best possible visual acuity and stereopsis. It is from the Greek strabismós. \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\nWhen observing a patient with strabismus, the misalignment of the eyes may be quite apparent. A patient with a constant eye turn of significant magnitude is very easy to notice.  However, a small magnitude or intermittent strabismus can easily be missed upon casual observation. In any case, an eye care professional can conduct various tests, such as cover testing, to determine the full extent of the strabismus.\n\nStrabismus can be seen in Down syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, cerebral palsy, and Edwards syndrome.\n\nSymptoms of strabismus include double vision and/or eye strain. To avoid double vision, the brain may adapt by ignoring one eye.  In this case, often no noticeable symptoms are seen other than a minor loss of depth perception. This deficit may not be noticeable in someone who has had strabismus since birth or early childhood, as they have likely learned to judge depth and distances using monocular cues. However, a constant unilateral strabismus causing constant suppression is a risk for amblyopia in children. Small-angle and intermittent strabismus are more likely to cause disruptive visual symptoms. In addition to headaches and eye strain, symptoms may include an inability to read comfortably, fatigue when reading, and unstable or \"jittery\" vision.\n\nPsychosocial effects \n\nPeople of all ages who have noticeable strabismus may experience psychosocial difficulties.    Attention has also been drawn to potential socioeconomic impact resulting from cases of detectable strabismus. A socioeconomic consideration exists as well in the context of decisions regarding strabismus treatment including efforts to re-establish binocular vision and the possibility of stereopsis recovery. \n\nOne study has shown that strabismic children commonly exhibit behaviors marked by higher degrees of inhibition, anxiety, and emotional distress, often leading to outright emotional disorders. These disorders are often related to a negative perception of the child by peers. This is not only due to an altered aesthetic appearance, but also because of the inherent symbolic nature of the eye and gaze, and the vitally important role they play in an individual's life as social components. For some, these issues improved dramatically following strabismus surgery.  Notably, strabismus interferes with normal eye contact, often causing embarrassment, anger, and feelings of awkwardness, thereby affecting social communication in a fundamental way, with a possible negative effect on self-esteem. \n\nThere are indications that children with strabismus, particularly those with exotropia (an outward turn), are more likely to develop a mental health disorder than normal-sighted children. Researchers have theorized that esotropia (an inward turn) was not found to be linked to a higher propensity for mental illness due to the age range of the participants, as well as the shorter follow-up time period; esotropic children were monitored to a mean age of 15.8 years, compared with 20.3 years for the exotropic group.    A subsequent study with participants from the same area monitored congenital esotropia patients for a longer time period; results indicated that esotropic patients were also more likely to develop mental illness of some sort upon reaching early adulthood, similar to those with constant exotropia, intermittent exotropia, or convergence insufficiency. The likelihood was 2.6 times that of controls. No apparent association with premature birth was observed, and no evidence was found linking later onset of mental illness to psychosocial stressors frequently encountered by those with strabismus.\n\nInvestigations have highlighted the impact that strabismus may typically have on quality of life.  Studies centered around images of strabismic and non-strabismic persons showed a strong negative bias towards those visibly displaying the condition, clearly demonstrating the potential for future socioeconomic implications with regard to employability, as well as other psychosocial effects related to an individual's overall happiness.  \n\nAdult and child observers perceived a right heterotropia as more disturbing than a left heterotropia, and child observers perceived an esotropia as \"worse\" than an exotropia.   Successful surgical correction of strabismus—for adult patients as well as children—has been shown to have a significantly positive effect on psychological well-being.  \n\nVery little research exists regarding coping strategies employed by adult strabismics. One study categorized coping methods into three sub-categories: avoidance (refraining from participation an activity), distraction (deflecting attention from the condition), and adjustment (approaching an activity differently). The authors of the study suggested that individuals with strabismus may benefit from psychosocial support such as interpersonal skills training. \n\nPathophysiology \n\nThe extraocular muscles control the position of the eyes.  Thus, a problem with the muscles or the nerves controlling them can cause paralytic strabismus.  The extraocular muscles are controlled by cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. An impairment of cranial nerve III causes the associated eye to deviate down and out and may or may not affect the size of the pupil.  Impairment of cranial nerve IV, which can be congenital, causes the eye to drift up and perhaps slightly inward. Sixth nerve palsy causes the eyes to deviate inward and has many causes due to the relatively long path of the nerve.  Increased cranial pressure can compress the nerve as it runs between the clivus and brain stem.  Also, if the doctor is not careful, twisting of the baby's neck during forceps delivery can damage cranial nerve VI.\n\nEvidence indicates a cause for strabismus may lie with the input provided to the visual cortex.   This allows for strabismus to occur without the direct impairment of any cranial nerves or extraocular muscles.\n\nStrabismus may cause amblyopia due to the brain ignoring one eye. Amblyopia is the failure of one or both eyes to achieve normal visual acuity despite normal structural health. During the first seven to eight years of life, the brain learns how to interpret the signals that come from an eye through a process called visual development.  Development may be interrupted by strabismus if the child always fixates with one eye and rarely or never fixates with the other. To avoid double vision, the signal from the deviated eye is suppressed, and the constant suppression of one eye causes a failure of the visual development in that eye.\n\nAlso, amblyopia may cause strabismus.  If a great difference in clarity occurs between the images from the right and left eyes, input may be insufficient to correctly reposition the eyes.  Other causes of a visual difference between right and left eyes, such as asymmetrical cataracts, refractive error, or other eye disease, can also cause or worsen strabismus.\n\nAccommodative esotropia is a form of strabismus caused by refractive error in one or both eyes.  Due to the near triad, when a patient engages accommodation to focus on a near object, an increase in the signal sent by cranial nerve III to the medial rectus muscles results, drawing the eyes inward; this is called the accommodation reflex.  If the accommodation needed is more than the usual amount, such as with people with significant hyperopia, the extra convergence can cause the eyes to cross.\n\nDiagnosis \n\nDuring an eye examination, a test such as cover testing or the Hirschberg test is used in the diagnosis and measurement of strabismus and its effect on vision. Retinal birefringence scanning can be used for screening of young children for eye misaligments.\n\nSeveral classifications are made when diagnosing strabismus.\n\nLatency \n\nStrabismus can be manifest (-tropia) or latent (-phoria).  A manifest deviation, or heterotropia (which may be eso-, exo-, hyper-, hypo-, cyclotropia or a combination of these), is present while the patient views a target binocularly, with no occlusion of either eye.  The patient is unable to align the gaze of each eye to achieve fusion.  A latent deviation, or heterophoria (eso-, exo-, hyper-, hypo-, cyclophoria or a combination of these), is only present after binocular vision has been interrupted, typically by covering one eye.  This type of patient can typically maintain fusion despite the misalignment that occurs when the positioning system is relaxed.  Intermittent strabismus is a combination of both of these types, where the patient can achieve fusion, but occasionally or frequently falters to the point of a manifest deviation.\n\nOnset \n\nStrabismus may also be classified based on time of onset, either congenital, acquired, or secondary to another pathological process. Many infants are born with their eyes slightly misaligned, and this is typically outgrown by six to 12 months of age.   Acquired and secondary strabismus develop later. The onset of accommodative esotropia, an overconvergence of the eyes due to the effort of accommodation, is mostly in early childhood. Acquired non-accommodative strabismus and secondary strabismus are developed after normal binocular vision has developed. In adults with previously normal alignment, the onset of strabismus usually results in double vision.\n\nAny disease that causes vision loss may also cause strabismus,  but it can also result from any severe and/or traumatic injury to the affected eye. Sensory strabismus is strabismus due to vision loss or impairment, leading to horizontal, vertical or torsional misalignment or to a combination thereof, with the eye with poorer vision drifting slightly over time. Most often, the outcome is horizontal misalignment. Its direction depends on the patient age at which the damage occurs: patients whose vision is lost or impaired at birth are more likely to develop esotropia, whereas patients with acquired vision loss or impairment mostly develop exotropia.    In the extreme, complete blindness in one eye generally leads to the blind eye reverting to an anatomical position of rest. \n\nAlthough many possible causes of strabismus are known, among them severe and/or traumatic injuries to the afflicted eye, in many cases no specific cause can be identified. This last is typically the case when strabismus is present since early childhood. \n\nResults of a U.S. cohort study indicate that the incidence of adult-onset strabismus increases with age, especially after the sixth decade of life, and peaks in the eighth decade of life, and that the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with adult-onset strabismus is approximately 4%. \n\nLaterality \n\nStrabismus may be classified as unilateral if the one eye consistently deviates, or alternating if either of the eyes can be seen to deviate. Alternation of the strabismus may occur spontaneously, with or without subjective awareness of the alternation. Alternation may also be triggered by various tests during an eye exam. Unilateral strabismus has been observed to result from a severe and/or traumatic injury to the affected eye.\n\nDirection \n\nHorizontal deviations are classified into two varieties.  Eso describes inward or convergent deviations towards the midline.  Exo describes outward or divergent misalignment.  Vertical deviations are also classified into two varieties.  Hyper is the term for an eye whose gaze is directed higher than the fellow eye while hypo refers to an eye whose gaze is directed lower.  Cyclo refers to torsional strabismus, which occurs when the eyes rotate around the anterior-posterior axis to become misaligned and is quite rare.\n\nNaming \n\nThe directional prefixes are combined with -tropia and -phoria to describe various types of strabismus.  For example, a constant left hypertropia exists when a patient's left eye is always aimed higher than the right.  A patient with an intermittent right esotropia has a right eye that occasionally drifts toward the patient's nose, but at other times is able to align with the gaze of the left eye.  A patient with a mild exophoria can maintain fusion during normal circumstances, but when the system is disrupted, the relaxed posture of the eyes is slightly divergent.\n\nOther considerations \n\nStrabismus can be further classified as follows:\n\n* Paretic strabismus is due to paralysis of one or several extraocular muscles.\n* Nonparetic strabismus is not due to paralysis of extraocular muscles.\n* Comitant (or concomitant) strabismus is a deviation that is the same magnitude regardless of gaze position.\n* Noncomitant (or incomitant) strabismus has a magnitude that varies as the patient shifts his or her gaze up, down, or to the sides.\n\nNonparetic strabismus is generally concomitant.  Most types of infant and childhood strabismus are comitant.  Paretic strabismus can be either comitant or noncomitant. Incomitant strabismus is almost always caused by a limitation of ocular rotations that is due to a restriction of extraocular eye movement (ocular restriction) or due to extraocular muscle paresis. Incomitant strabismus cannot be fully corrected by prism glasses, because the eyes would require different degrees of prismatic correction dependent on the direction of the gaze.  Incomitant strabismus of the eso- or exo-type are classified as \"alphabet patterns\": they are denoted as A- or V- or more rarely λ-, Y- or X-pattern depending on the extent of convergence or divergence when the gaze moves upward or downward. These letters of the alphabet denote ocular motility pattern that have a similarity to the respective letter: in the A-pattern there is (relatively speaking) more convergence when the gaze is directed upwards and more divergence when it is directed downwards, in the V-pattern it is the contrary, in the  λ-, Y- and X-patterns there is little or no strabismus in the middle position but relatively more divergence in one or both of the upward and downward positions, depending on the \"shape\" of the letter. \n\nTypes of incomitant strabismus include: Duane syndrome, horizontal gaze palsy, and congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles. \n\nWhen the misalignment of the eyes is large and obvious, the strabismus is called large-angle, referring to the angle of deviation between the lines of sight of the eyes. Less severe eye turns are called small-angle strabismus.  The degree of strabismus can vary based on whether the patient is viewing a distant or near target.\n\nStrabismus that sets in after eye alignment had been surgically corrected is called consecutive strabismus.\n\nPseudostrabismus is the false appearance of strabismus. It generally occurs in infants and toddlers whose bridge of the nose is wide and flat, causing the appearance of esotropia due to less sclera being visible nasally.  With age, the bridge of the child's nose narrows and the folds in the corner of the eyes become less prominent.\n\nManagement \n\nAs with other binocular vision disorders, the primary therapeutic goal for those with strabismus is comfortable, single, clear, normal binocular vision at all distances and directions of gaze. \n\nWhereas amblyopia (lazy eye), if minor and detected early, can often be corrected with use of an eye patch on the dominant eye and/or vision therapy, the use of eye patches is unlikely to change the angle of strabismus. Strabismus is usually treated with a combination of eyeglasses, vision therapy, and surgery, depending on the underlying reason for the misalignment. For parents it is important to know that strabismus surgery does not remove the need for a child to wear glasses. Currently it is unknown whether there are any differences for completing strabismus surgery before or after amblyopia therapy in children. \n\nIn cases of accommodative esotropia, the eyes turn inward due to the effort of focusing far-sighted eyes, and the treatment of this type of strabismus necessarily involves refractive correction, which is usually done via corrective glasses or contact lenses, and in these cases surgical alignment is considered only if such correction does not resolve the eye turn.\n\nIn case of strong anisometropia, contact lenses may be preferable to spectacles because they avoid the problem of visual disparities due to size differences (aniseikonia) which is otherwise caused by spectacles in which the refractive power is very different for the two eyes. In a few cases of strabismic children with anisometropic amblyopia, a balancing of the refractive error eyes via refractive surgery has been performed before strabismus surgery was undertaken. \n\nStrabismus surgery attempts to align the eyes by shortening, lengthening, or changing the position of one or more of the extraocular eye muscles. The procedure can typically be performed in about an hour, and requires about one or two weeks for recovery. Adjustable sutures may be used to permit refinement of the eye alignment in the early postoperative period. \n\nDouble vision can rarely result, especially immediately after the surgery, and vision loss is very rare. Glasses affect the position by changing the person's reaction to focusing. Prisms change the way light, and therefore images, strike the eye, simulating a change in the eye position.\n\nEarly treatment of strabismus in infancy may reduce the chance of developing amblyopia and depth perception problems. However, a review of randomized controlled trials concluded that the use of corrective glasses to prevent strabismus is not supported by existing research.  Most children eventually recover from amblyopia if they have had the benefit of patches and corrective glasses. Amblyopia has long been considered to remain permanent if not treated within a critical period, namely before the age of about seven years; however, recent discoveries give reason to challenge this view and to adapt the earlier notion of a critical period to account for stereopsis recovery in adults.\n\nEyes that remain misaligned can still develop visual problems. Although not a cure for strabismus, prism lenses can also be used to provide some temporary comfort for sufferers and to prevent double vision from occurring.\n\nPharmacologic treatment is used for strabismus in certain circumstances. In 1989, the US FDA approved Botulinum toxin therapy for strabismus in patients over 12 years old.   Most commonly used in adults, the technique is also used for treating children, in particular children affected by infantile esotropia.    The toxin is injected in the stronger muscle, causing temporary and partial paralysis. The treatment may need to be repeated three to four months later once the paralysis wears off. Common side effects are double vision, droopy eyelid, overcorrection, and no effect. The side effects typically resolve also within three to four months.\n\nPrognosis \n\nWhen strabismus is congenital or develops in infancy, it can cause amblyopia, in which the brain ignores input from the deviated eye. Even with therapy for amblyopia, stereoblindness may occur. The appearance of strabismus may also be a cosmetic problem. One study reported 85% of adult strabismus patients \"reported that they had problems with work, school, and sports because of their strabismus\". The same study also reported 70% said strabismus \"had a negative effect on their self-image\".  A second operation is sometimes required to straighten the eyes."

                "The National Gallery is an art museum in Trafalgar Square in the City of Westminster, in Central London. Founded in 1824, it houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900. The Gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.  Its collection belongs to the public of the United Kingdom and entry to the main collection is free of charge. It is among the most visited art museums in the world, after the Musée du Louvre, the British Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nUnlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the British government bought 38 paintings from the heirs of John Julius Angerstein, an insurance broker and patron of the arts, in 1824. After that initial purchase the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, notably Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, and by private donations, which comprise two-thirds of the collection.  The resulting collection is small in size, compared with many European national galleries, but encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting \"from Giotto to Cézanne\"  are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition,  but this is no longer the case.\n\nThe present building, the third to house the National Gallery, was designed by William Wilkins from 1832 to 1838. Only the façade onto Trafalgar Square remains essentially unchanged from this time, as the building has been expanded piecemeal throughout its history. Wilkins's building was often criticised for the perceived weaknesses of its design and for its lack of space; the latter problem led to the establishment of the Tate Gallery for British art in 1897. The Sainsbury Wing, an extension to the west by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, is a notable example of Postmodernist architecture in Britain. The current Director of the National Gallery is Gabriele Finaldi.\n\nHistory\n\nThe call for a National Gallery\n\nThe late 18th century saw the nationalisation of royal or princely art collections across mainland Europe. The Bavarian royal collection (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich) opened to the public in 1779, that of the Medici in Florence around 1789 (as the Uffizi Gallery), and the Museum Français at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793.  Great Britain, however, did not emulate the continental model, and the British Royal Collection remains in the sovereign's possession today. In 1777 the British government had the opportunity to buy an art collection of international stature, when the descendants of Sir Robert Walpole put his collection up for sale. The MP John Wilkes argued for the government to buy this \"invaluable treasure\" and suggested that it be housed in \"a noble gallery... to be built in the spacious garden of the British Museum\"  Nothing came of Wilkes's appeal and 20 years later the collection was bought in its entirety by Catherine the Great; it is now to be found in the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.\n\nA plan to acquire 150 paintings from the Orléans collection, which had been brought to London for sale in 1798, also failed, despite the interest of both the King and the Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger.  The twenty-five paintings from that collection now in the Gallery, including \"NG1\", have arrived by a variety of routes. In 1799 the dealer Noel Desenfans offered a ready-made national collection to the British government; he and his partner Sir Francis Bourgeois had assembled it for the king of Poland, before the Third Partition in 1795 abolished Polish independence. This offer was declined and Bourgeois bequeathed the collection to his old school, Dulwich College, on his death. The collection opened in Britain's first purpose-built public gallery, the Dulwich Picture Gallery, in 1814. The Scottish dealer William Buchanan and another collector, Joseph Count Truchsess, both formed art collections expressly as the basis for a future national collection, but their respective offers (made in the same year, 1803) were also declined.\n\nFollowing the Walpole sale many artists, including James Barry and John Flaxman, had made renewed calls for the establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The British Institution, founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre,  some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings.  One of the Institution's founding members, Sir George Beaumont, Bt, would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.\n\nIn 1823 another major art collection came on the market, which had been assembled by the recently deceased John Julius Angerstein. Angerstein was a Russian-born émigré banker based in London; his collection numbered 38 paintings, including works by Raphael and Hogarth's Marriage à-la-mode series. On 1 July 1823 George Agar Ellis, a Whig politician, proposed to the House of Commons that it purchase the collection.  The appeal was given added impetus by Beaumont's offer, which came with two conditions: that the government buy Angerstein's collection, and that a suitable building was to be found. The unexpected repayment of a war debt by Austria finally moved the government to buy Angerstein's collection, for £57,000.\n\nFoundation and early history\n\nThe National Gallery opened to the public on 10 May 1824, housed in Angerstein's former townhouse at No. 100 Pall Mall. Angerstein's paintings were joined in 1826 by those from Beaumont's collection, and in 1831 by the Reverend William Holwell Carr's bequest of 35 paintings.  Initially the Keeper of Paintings, William Seguier, bore the burden of managing the Gallery, but in July 1824 some of this responsibility fell to the newly formed board of trustees.\n\nThe National Gallery at Pall Mall was frequently overcrowded and hot and its diminutive size in comparison with the Louvre in Paris was the cause of national embarrassment. But Agar Ellis, now a trustee of the Gallery, appraised the site for being \"in the very gangway of London\"; this was seen as necessary for the Gallery to fulfil its social purpose. Subsidence in No. 100 caused the Gallery to move briefly to No. 105 Pall Mall, which the novelist Anthony Trollope described as a \"dingy, dull, narrow house, ill-adapted for the exhibition of the treasures it held\".  This in turn had to be demolished for the opening of a road to Carlton House Terrace. \n\nIn 1832 construction began on a new building by William Wilkins on the site of the King's Mews in Charing Cross, in an area that had been transformed over the 1820s into Trafalgar Square. The location was a significant one, between the wealthy West End and poorer areas to the east.  The argument that the collection could be accessed by people of all social classes outstripped other concerns, such as the pollution of central London or the failings of Wilkins's building, when the prospect of a move to South Kensington was mooted in the 1850s. According to the Parliamentary Commission of 1857, \"The existence of the pictures is not the end purpose of the collection, but the means only to give the people an ennobling enjoyment\". \n\nFrom 1837 until 1868 the Royal Academy was housed in the east wing of the building.\n\nGrowth under Eastlake and his successors\n\n15th- and 16th-century Italian paintings were at the core of the National Gallery and for the first 30 years of its existence the Trustees' independent acquisitions were mainly limited to works by High Renaissance masters. Their conservative tastes resulted in several missed opportunities and the management of the Gallery later fell into complete disarray, with no acquisitions being made between 1847 and 1850.  A critical House of Commons Report in 1851 called for the appointment of a director, whose authority would surpass that of the trustees. Many thought the position would go to the German art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen, whom the Gallery had consulted on previous occasions about the lighting and display of the collections. However, the man preferred for the job by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and the Prime Minister, Lord Russell, was the Keeper of Paintings at the Gallery, Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, who was President of the Royal Academy, played an essential role in the foundation of the Arundel Society, and knew most of London's leading art experts.\n\nThe new director’s taste was for the Northern and Early Italian Renaissance masters or \"primitives\", who had been neglected by the Gallery’s acquisitions policy but were slowly gaining recognition from connoisseurs. Eastlake made annual tours to the continent and to Italy in particular, seeking out appropriate paintings to buy for the Gallery. In all, he bought 148 pictures abroad and 46 in Britain,  among the former such seminal works as Paolo Uccello’s Battle of San Romano. Eastlake also amassed a private art collection during this period, consisting of paintings that he knew did not interest the trustees. His ultimate aim, however, was for them to enter the National Gallery; this was duly arranged upon his death by his friend and successor as director, William Boxall, and his widow Lady Eastlake.\n\nThe Gallery’s lack of space remained acute in this period. In 1845 a large bequest of British paintings was made by Robert Vernon; there was insufficient room in the Wilkins building so these were displayed first in Vernon’s town house at No. 50 Pall Mall and then at Marlborough House.  The Gallery was even less well equipped for its next major bequest, as J. M. W. Turner was to bequeath the entire contents of his studio, excepting unfinished works, to the nation upon his death in 1851. The first 20 of these were displayed off-site in Marlborough House in 1856.  The stipulation in Turner's will that two of his paintings be displayed alongside works by Claude  is still honoured in Room 15 of the Gallery, but his bequest has never been adequately displayed in its entirety; today the works are divided between Trafalgar Square and the Clore Gallery, a small purpose-built extension to the Tate completed in 1985.\n\nThe third director, Sir Frederick William Burton, laid the foundations of the collection of 18th-century art and made several outstanding purchases from English private collections. The acquisition in 1885 of two paintings from Blenheim Palace, Raphael's Ansidei Madonna and Van Dyck's Equestrian Portrait of Charles I, with a record-setting grant of £87,500 from the Treasury, brought the Gallery's \"golden age of collecting\" to an end, as its annual purchase grant was suspended for several years thereafter.  When the Gallery purchased Holbein's Ambassadors from the Earl of Radnor in 1890, it did so with the aid of private individuals for the first time in its history.  In 1897 the formation of the National Gallery of British Art, known unofficially from early in its history as the Tate Gallery, allowed some British works to be moved off-site, following the precedent set by the Vernon collection and the Turner Bequest. Works by artists born after 1790 were moved to the new gallery on Millbank, which allowed Hogarth, Turner and Constable to remain in Trafalgar Square.\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nThe agricultural crisis at the turn of the 20th century caused many aristocratic families to sell their paintings, but the British national collections were priced out of the market by American plutocrats.  This prompted the foundation of the National Art Collections Fund, a society of subscribers dedicated to stemming the flow of artworks to the United States. Their first acquisition for the National Gallery was Velázquez's Rokeby Venus in 1906, followed by Holbein's Portrait of Christina of Denmark in 1909. However, despite the crisis in aristocratic fortunes, the following decade was one of several great bequests from private collectors. In 1909 the industrialist Dr Ludwig Mond gave 42 Italian renaissance paintings, including the Mond Crucifixion by Raphael, to the Gallery.  Other bequests of note were those of George Salting in 1910, Austen Henry Layard in 1916 and Sir Hugh Lane in 1917; the last of these was one of the Gallery's more controversial bequests.\n\nIn a rare example of the political protest for which Trafalgar Square is famous occurring in the National Gallery, the Rokeby Venus was damaged on 10 March 1914 by Mary Richardson, a campaigner for women's suffrage, in protest against the arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day. Later that month another suffragette attacked five Bellinis, causing the Gallery to close until the start of the First World War, when the Women's Social and Political Union called for an end to violent acts drawing attention to their plight. \n\nThe reception of Impressionist art at the Gallery got off to an exceptionally stormy start. In 1906, Sir Hugh Lane promised 39 paintings, including Renoir's Umbrellas, to the National Gallery on his death, unless a suitable building could be built in Dublin. Although eagerly accepted by the director Charles Holroyd, they were received with extreme hostility by the Trustees; Lord Redesdale wrote that \"I would as soon expect to hear of a Mormon service being conducted in St. Paul's Cathedral as to see the exhibition of the works of the modern French Art-rebels in the sacred precincts of Trafalgar Square\".  Perhaps as a result of such attitudes, Lane amended his will with a codicil that the works should only go to Ireland, but crucially this was never witnessed.  Lane died on board the RMS Lusitania in 1915, and a dispute began which was not resolved until 1959. Part of the collection is now on permanent loan to Dublin City Gallery (\"The Hugh Lane\") and other works rotate between London and Dublin every few years.\n\nA fund for the purchase of modern paintings established by Samuel Courtauld in 1923 bought Seurat's Bathers at Asnières and other notable modern works for the nation;  in 1934 these transferred to the National Gallery from the Tate.\n\nWorld War II\n\nShortly before the outbreak of World War II the paintings were evacuated to various locations in Wales, including Penrhyn Castle and the university colleges of Bangor and Aberystwyth.  In 1940, as the Battle of France raged, a more secure home was sought, and there were discussions about moving the paintings to Canada. This idea was firmly rejected by Winston Churchill, who wrote in a telegram to the director Kenneth Clark, “bury them in caves or in cellars, but not a picture shall leave these islands”.  Instead a slate quarry at Manod, near Blaenau Ffestiniog in North Wales, was requisitioned for the Gallery's use. In the seclusion afforded by the paintings' new location, the Keeper (and future director) Martin Davies began to compile scholarly catalogues on the collection, helped by the fact that the Gallery's library was also stored in the quarry. The move to Manod confirmed the importance of storing paintings at a constant temperature and humidity, something the Gallery's conservators had long suspected but had hitherto been unable to prove.  This eventually resulted in the first air-conditioned gallery opening in 1949.\n\nFor the course of the war Myra Hess, and other musicians, such as Moura Lympany, gave daily lunch-time recitals in the empty building, to raise public morale at a time when every concert hall in London was closed.  A number of art exhibitions were held at the Gallery as a complement to the recitals. The first of these was British Painting since Whistler in 1940, organised by Lillian Browse,Farr, Dennis (2006).

Yeats held from 1 January – 15 March 1942, which was seen by 10,518 visitors.Clark, Sir Kenneth (1942). Exhibition of Paintings by Sir William Nicholson and Jack B. Yeats, exhibition catalogue.

ISBN 978 0 300 17054 2. pp. 636–638 Exhibitions of work by war artists, including Paul Nash, Henry Moore and Stanley Spencer, were also held; the War Artists' Advisory Committee had been set up by Clark in order \"to keep artists at work on any pretext\".  In 1941 a request from an artist to see Rembrandt's Portrait of Margaretha de Geer (a new acquisition) resulted in the \"Picture of the Month\" scheme, in which a single painting was removed from Manod and exhibited to the general public in the National Gallery each month. The art critic Herbert Read, writing that year, called the National Gallery \"a defiant outpost of culture right in the middle of a bombed and shattered metropolis\".  The paintings returned to Trafalgar Square in 1945.\n\nPost-war developments\n\nIn the post-war years, acquisitions have become increasingly difficult for the National Gallery as the prices for Old Masters – and even more so for the Impressionists and Post-impressionists – have risen beyond its means. Some of the Gallery's most significant purchases in this period would have been impossible without the major public appeals backing them, including The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist by Leonardo da Vinci (bought in 1962) and Titian’s Death of Actaeon (1972). The Gallery's purchase grant from the government was frozen in 1985, but later that year it received an endowment of £50 million from Sir Paul Getty, enabling many major purchases to be made. In April 1985 Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and his brothers, the Hon. Simon Sainsbury and Sir Timothy Sainsbury, had made a donation that would enable the construction of the Sainsbury Wing. \n\nThe directorship of Neil MacGregor saw a major rehang at the Gallery, dispensing with the classification of paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in art historical values since the 19th century.  In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored, and in 1999 the Gallery accepted a bequest of 26 Italian Baroque paintings from Sir Denis Mahon. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the Gallery's trustees declined to buy a Guercino from Mahon's collection for £200. The same painting was valued at £4 million in 2003.  Mahon's bequest was made on the condition that the Gallery would never deaccession any of its paintings or charge for admission. \n\nSince 1989, the gallery has run a scheme that gives a studio to contemporary artists to create work based on the permanent collection. They usually hold the position of associate artist for two years and are given an exhibition in the National Gallery at the end of their tenure.\n\nThe respective remits of the National and Tate Galleries, which had long been contested by the two institutions, were more clearly defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection were given to the Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by Gauguin and others. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls. \n\nIn the 21st century there have been three large fundraising campaigns at the Gallery: in 2004, to buy Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, in 2008, for Titian's Diana and Actaeon, and in 2012, Titian's Diana and Callisto. Both Titians were bought in tandem with the National Gallery of Scotland for £95 m. Both of these major works were sold from the famous collection of the Duke of Sutherland. The National Gallery is now largely priced out of the market for Old Master paintings and can only make such acquisitions with the backing of major public appeals; the departing director Charles Saumarez Smith expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007.\n\nIn 2014, the National Gallery was the subject of a documentary film by Frederick Wiseman. The film shows the gallery administration and staff at work, the conservation laboratory, docent tours, and the mounting of Leonardo Da Vinci, J. M. W. Turner, and Titian exhibitions in 2011–2012.\n\nArchitecture\n\nWilliam Wilkins' building\n\nThe first suggestion for a National Gallery on Trafalgar Square came from John Nash, who envisaged it on the site of the King's Mews, while a Parthenon-like building for the Royal Academy would occupy the centre of the square. Economic recession prevented this scheme from being built, but a competition for the Mews site was eventually held in 1831, for which Nash submitted a design with C. R. Cockerell as his co-architect. Nash's popularity was waning by this time, however, and the commission was awarded to William Wilkins, who was involved in the selection of the site and submitted some drawings at the last moment.  Wilkins had hoped to build a \"Temple of the Arts, nurturing contemporary art through historical example\",  but the commission was blighted by parsimony and compromise, and the resulting building was deemed a failure on almost all counts.\n\nThe site only allowed for the building to be one room deep, as a workhouse and a barracks lay immediately behind. To exacerbate matters, there was a public right of way through the site to these buildings, which accounts for the access porticoes on the eastern and western sides of the façade. These had to incorporate columns from the demolished Carlton House and their relative shortness result in an elevation that was deemed excessively low, and a far cry from the commanding focal point that was desired for the northern end of the Square. Also recycled are the sculptures on the façade, originally intended for Nash's Marble Arch but abandoned due to his financial problems. The eastern half of the building housed the Royal Academy until 1868, which further diminished the space afforded to the Gallery.\n\nThe building was the object of public ridicule before it had even been completed, as a version of the design had been leaked to the Literary Gazette in 1833. \nTwo years before completion, its infamous \"pepperpot\" elevation appeared on the frontispiece of Contrasts (1836), an influential tract by the Gothicist A. W. N. Pugin, as an example of the degeneracy of the classical style.  Even William IV (in his last recorded utterance) thought the building a \"nasty little pokey hole\",  while William Makepeace Thackeray called it \"a little gin shop of a building\". The twentieth-century architectural historian Sir John Summerson echoed these early criticisms when he compared the arrangement of a dome and two diminutive turrets on the roofline to \"the clock and vases on a mantelpiece, only less useful\". Sir Charles Barry's landscaping of Trafalgar Square, from 1840, included a north terrace so that the building would appear to be raised, thus addressing one of the points of complaint. Opinion on the building had mellowed considerably by 1984, when the Prince of Wales called the Wilkins façade a \"much-loved and elegant friend\", in contrast to a proposed extension.

Ornately decorated in comparison with the rooms by Wilkins, it nonetheless worsened the cramped conditions inside the building as it was built over the original entrance hall.  Unsurprisingly, several attempts were made either to completely remodel the National Gallery (as suggested by Sir Charles Barry in 1853), or to move it to more capacious premises in Kensington, where the air was also cleaner. In 1867 Barry's son Edward Middleton Barry proposed to replace the Wilkins building with a massive classical building with four domes. The scheme was a failure and contemporary critics denounced the exterior as \"a strong plagiarism upon St Paul's Cathedral\". \n\nWith the demolition of the workhouse, however, Barry was able to build the Gallery's first sequence of grand architectural spaces, from 1872 to 1876. Built to a polychrome Neo-Renaissance design, the Barry Rooms were arranged on a Greek cross-plan around a huge central octagon. Though it compensated for the underwhelming architecture of the Wilkins building, Barry's new wing was disliked by Gallery staff, who considered its monumental aspect to be in conflict with its function as exhibition space. Also, the decorative programme of the rooms did not take their intended contents into account; the ceiling of the 15th- and 16th-century Italian gallery, for instance, was inscribed with the names of British artists of the 19th century.  But despite these failures, the Barry Rooms provided the Gallery with a strong axial groundplan. This was to be followed by all subsequent additions to the Gallery for a century, resulting in a building of clear symmetry.\n\nPennethorne's gallery was demolished for the next phase of building, a scheme by Sir John Taylor extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed entrance vestibule had painted ceiling decorations by the Crace family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised, and that space is now taken up by Frederic, Lord Leighton’s painting of Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence (1853–55), lent by the Royal Collection in the 1990s. \n\nGalería Nacional, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 178.JPG|The Barry Rooms (1872–76), designed by Edward Middleton Barry\nBóveda de la sala 36, Galería Nacional, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 165-167 HDR.JPG|The dome of Room 34, the central octagon of the Barry Rooms\nStaircase hall of the National Gallery, London.jpg|The Staircase Hall, designed by Sir John Taylor in 1884–7.

The use of dark marble for doorcases was also continued, giving the extensions a degree of internal consistency with the older rooms. The classical style was still in use at the National Gallery in 1929, when a Beaux-Arts style gallery was built, funded by the art dealer and Trustee Lord Duveen. However, it was not long before the 20th-century reaction against Victorian attitudes became manifest at the Gallery. From 1928 to 1952 the landing floors of Taylor's entrance hall were relaid with a new series of mosaics by Boris Anrep, who was friendly with the Bloomsbury Group. These mosaics can be read as a satire on 19th-century conventions for the decoration of public buildings, as typified by the Albert Memorial's Frieze of Parnassus.  The central mosaic depicting The Awakening of the Muses includes portraits of Virginia Woolf and Greta Garbo, subverting the high moral tone of its Victorian forebears. In place of Christianity's seven virtues, Anrep offered his own set of Modern Virtues, including \"Humour\" and \"Open Mind\"; the allegorical figures are again portraits of his contemporaries, including Winston Churchill, Bertrand Russell and T. S. Eliot. \n\nIn the 20th century the Gallery's late Victorian interiors fell out of fashion.  The Crace ceiling decorations in the entrance hall were not to the taste of the director Charles Holmes, and were obliterated by white paint.They were restored only in 2005. \nThe North Galleries, which opened to the public in 1975, marked the arrival of modernist architecture at the National Gallery. In the older rooms, the original classical details were effaced by partitions, daises and suspended roofs, the aim being to create neutral settings which did not distract from contemplation of the paintings. But the Gallery's commitment to modernism was short-lived: by the 1980s Victorian style was no longer considered anathema, and a restoration programme began to restore the 19th- and early-20th-century interiors to their purported original appearance. This began with the refurbishment of the Barry Rooms in 1985–6. From 1996 to 1999 even the North Galleries, by then considered to \"lack a positive architectural character\" were remodelled in a classical style, albeit a simplified one.\n\nSainsbury Wing and later additions\n\nThe most important addition to the building in recent years has been the Sainsbury Wing, designed by the postmodernist architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown to house the collection of Renaissance paintings, and built in 1991. The building occupies the \"Hampton's site\" to the west of the main building, where a department store of the same name had stood until its destruction in the Blitz. The Gallery had long sought expansion into this space and in 1982 a competition was held to find a suitable architect; the shortlist included a radical high-tech proposal by Richard Rogers, among others. The design that won the most votes was by the firm Ahrends, Burton and Koralek, who then modified their proposal to include a tower, similar to that of the Rogers scheme. The proposal was dropped after the Prince of Wales compared the design to a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend\",  The term \"monstrous carbuncle\", for a modern building that clashes with its surroundings, has since become commonplace.  \n\nOne of the conditions of the 1982 competition was that the new wing had to include commercial offices as well as public gallery space. However, in 1985 it became possible to devote the extension entirely to the Gallery's uses, due to a donation of almost £50 million from Lord Sainsbury and his brothers Simon and Sir Tim Sainsbury. A closed competition was held, and the schemes produced were noticeably more restrained than in the earlier competition.\n\nIn contrast with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale of many of the paintings. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir John Soane's toplit galleries for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the church interiors of Filippo Brunelleschi (the stone dressing is in pietra serena, the grey stone local to Florence). The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, so that there is a single vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of false perspective, as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by Cima of The Incredulity of St Thomas. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the Scala Regia in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.\n\nFollowing the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, the Gallery is currently engaged in a masterplan to convert the vacated office space on the ground floor into public space. The plan will also fill in disused courtyards and make use of land acquired from the adjoining National Portrait Gallery in St Martin's Place, which it gave to the National Gallery in exchange for land for its 2000 extension. The first phase, the East Wing Project designed by Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones, opened to the public in 2004. This provided a new ground level entrance from Trafalgar Square, named in honour of Sir Paul Getty. The main entrance was also refurbished, and reopened in September 2005. Possible future projects include a \"West Wing Project\" roughly symmetrical with the East Wing Project, which would provide a future ground level entrance, and the public opening of some small rooms at the far eastern end of the building acquired as part of the swap with the National Portrait Gallery. This might include a new public staircase in the bow on the eastern façade. No timetable has been announced for these additional projects.\n\nControversies\n\nOne of the most persistent criticisms of the National Gallery, apart from those who criticise inadequacies of the building, has been of its conservation policy. The Gallery's detractors accused it of having had an over-zealous approach to restoration. The first cleaning operation at the National Gallery began in 1844 after Eastlake's appointment as Keeper, and was the subject of attacks in the press after the first three paintings to receive the treatment – a Rubens, a Cuyp and a Velázquez – were unveiled to the public in 1846.  The Gallery's most virulent critic was J. Morris Moore, who wrote a series of letters to The Times under the pseudonym \"Verax\" savaging the institution's cleanings. While an 1853 Parliamentary Select Committee set up to investigate the matter cleared the Gallery of any wrongdoing, criticism of its methods has been erupting sporadically ever since from some in the art establishment.\n\nThe last major outcry against the use of radical conservation techniques at the National Gallery was sixty-six years ago in the immediate post-war years, following a restoration campaign by Chief Restorer Helmut Ruhemann while the paintings were in Manod Quarry. When the cleaned pictures were exhibited to the public in 1946 there followed a furore with parallels to that of a century earlier. The principal criticism was that the extensive removal of varnish, which was used in the 19th century to protect the surface of paintings but which darkened and discoloured them with time, may have resulted in the loss of \"harmonising\" glazes added to the paintings by the artists themselves. The opposition to Ruhemann's techniques was led by Ernst Gombrich, a professor at the Warburg Institute who in later correspondence with a restorer described being treated with \"offensive superciliousness\" by the National Gallery.  A 1947 commission concluded that no damage had been done in the recent cleanings.\n\nThe National Gallery has also been criticised for misattributing paintings. Kenneth Clark's decision in 1939 to relabel a group of paintings by anonymous artists of the Venetian school as works by Giorgione (a crowd-pulling artist due to the rarity of his paintings) made him unpopular with his staff. More recently, the attribution of a 17th-century painting of Samson and Delilah (bought in 1980) to Rubens has been contested by a group of art historians, who believe that the National Gallery has not admitted the mistake to avoid embarrassing those who were involved in the purchase, many of whom still work for the Gallery. \n\nIn February 2014, Men of the Docks, by U.S. artist George Bellows, was bought by the National Gallery for $25.5 million (£15.6 million). It was the first major American painting to be purchased by the Gallery. Director Nicholas Penny termed the painting a new direction for the Gallery – a non-European painting in a European style. Its sale was controversial in the U.S. \n\nList of Directors of the National Gallery\n\nCollection highlights\n\nFile:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|Jan van Eyck,The Arnolfini Portrait\nFile:Leonardo da Vinci - Virgin of the Rocks (National Gallery London).png|Leonardo da Vinci,The Virgin of the Rocks\nFile:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Holbein,The Ambassadors\nFile:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|J.

                "Advocaat or advocatenborrel is a traditional Dutch alcoholic beverage made from eggs, sugar and brandy.  The rich and creamy drink has a smooth, custard-like flavor and is similar to eggnog. The typical alcohol content is generally somewhere between 14% and 20% ABV. Its contents may be a blend of egg yolks, aromatic spirits, sugar or honey, brandy, vanilla and sometimes cream (or evaporated milk). Notable makers of advocaat include Bols, DeKuyper and Verpoorten.\n\nEtymology\n\nAdvocaat is the Dutch word for \"lawyer\". As the name of the drink, it is short for advocatenborrel, or \"lawyer's drink\", where borrel is Dutch for a shot of an alcoholic beverage. According to the 1882 edition of the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal (Dictionary of the Dutch Language), it is \"zoo genoemd als een goed smeersel voor de keel, en dus bijzonder dienstig geacht voor een advocaat, die in 't openbaar het woord moet voeren\" (\"so named as a good lubricant for the throat, and thus considered especially useful for a lawyer, who must speak in public.\" \n\nTypes and uses\n\nThick advocaat is sold mainly on the Dutch and Belgian market, though in lesser quantities it can also be found in German and Austrian markets. It is often eaten with a little spoon, while a more liquid version is sold as an export. Thick advocaat contains egg yolks, and is used as a waffle or poffertjes topping and as an ingredient for several kinds of desserts such as ice cream, custards and pastries. It is also served as an apéritif or digestif in a wide glass with whipped cream and cocoa powder sprinkled on top.\n\nIn the export variety whole eggs are used. The best known cocktail using advocaat is the Snowball: a mixture of advocaat, sparkling lemonade and sometimes lime juice, (although this is not required for the drink) that is often consumed near Christmas.  Another is the Fluffy duck, made with rum. A highly popular advocaat-based beverage is the Bombardino, a drink commonly found in Italian ski resorts, particularly the Italian Alps, made by mixing advocaat, brandy, and whipped cream. \n\nRelated drinks\n\nThe Polish equivalent called ajerkoniak (de: Eier—eggs; fr: Cognac) is based on vodka instead of brandy, despite what the name may suggest.\n\nRompope of Mexico, and Sabajón of Colombia are very similar liquors based on egg yolk and vanilla. Some varieties have additional flavourings.\n\nPopular culture \n\nIt was featured in the Stanley Kubrick movie The Shining as the drink spilled on Jack Nicholson by the Butler in the famous Gold Room scene."
