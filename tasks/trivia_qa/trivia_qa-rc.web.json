                "The Nile Delta ( ' or simply  ') is the delta formed in Northern Egypt (Lower Egypt) where the Nile River spreads out and drains into the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of the world's largest river deltas—from Alexandria in the west to Port Said in the east, it covers  of Mediterranean coastline—and is a rich agricultural region. From north to south the delta is approximately  in length. The Delta begins slightly down-river from Cairo.\n\nGeography\n\n \n\nFrom north to south, the delta  is approximately  in length. From west-to-east, it covers some  of coastline. The delta is sometimes divided into sections, with the Nile dividing into two main distributaries, the Damietta and the Rosetta, flowing into the Mediterranean at port cities with the same name. In the past, the delta had several distributaries, but these have been lost due to flood control, silting and changing relief. One such defunct distributary is Wadi Tumilat.\n\nThe Suez Canal runs to the east of the delta, entering the coastal Lake Manzala in the north-east of the delta. To the north-west are three other coastal lakes or lagoons: Lake Burullus, Lake Idku and Lake Maryut.\n\nThe Nile is considered to be an \"arcuate\" delta (arc-shaped), as it resembles a triangle or lotus flower when seen from above. The outer edges of the delta are eroding, and some coastal lagoons have seen increasing salinity levels as their connection to the Mediterranean Sea increases. Since the delta no longer receives an annual supply of nutrients and sediments from upstream due to the construction of the Aswan High Dam, the soils of the floodplains have become poorer, and large amounts of fertilizers are now used. Topsoil in the delta can be as much as 70 ft in depth.\n\nHistory\n\nPeople have lived in the Delta region for thousands of years, and it has been intensively farmed for at least the last five thousand years. The Delta River used to flood on an annual basis, but this ended with the construction of the Aswan Dam.\n\nAncient branches of the Nile\n\nRecords from ancient times (such as by Pliny the Elder) show that the delta had seven distributaries (from east to west):\n*the Pelusiac,\n*the Tanitic,\n*the Mendesian,\n*the Phatnitic (or Phatmetic), \n*the Sebennytic,\n*the Bolbitine, and\n*the Canopic (also called the Herakleotic  and the Agathodaemon)\n\nThere are now only two main branches, due to flood control, silting and changing relief: The Damietta (corresponding to the Phatnitic) to the east and the Rosetta (corresponding to the Bolbitine)  on the western part of the delta.\n\nThe Rosetta Stone was found in the Nile Delta in 1799 in the port city of Rosetta (anglicized name of Rashid). The delta was a major constituent of Lower Egypt. The Biblical Land of Goshen was located in a small area on the west bank of the Pelusiac distributary. There are many archaeological sites in and around the Nile Delta. \n\nPopulation\n\nAbout 39 million people live in the Delta region. Outside of major cities, population density in the delta averages 1,000 persons/km² or more. Alexandria is the largest city in the delta with an estimated population of more than 4,5 million. Other large cities in the delta include Shubra al Khaymah, Port Said, El-Mahalla El-Kubra, El Mansura, Tanta, and Zagazig. \n\nWildlife\n\nDuring autumn, parts of the Nile River are red with lotus flowers. The Lower Nile (North) and the Upper Nile (South) have plants that grow in abundance. The Upper Nile plant is the Egyptian lotus, and the Lower Nile plant is the Cyperus papyrus (papyrus sedge), although it is not nearly as plentiful as it once was, and is becoming quite rare.\n\nSeveral hundred thousand water birds winter in the delta, including the world’s largest concentrations of little gulls and whiskered terns. Other birds making their homes in the delta include grey herons, Kentish plovers, shovelers, cormorants, egrets and ibises.\n\nOther animals found in the delta include frogs, turtles, tortoises, mongooses, and the Nile monitor. Nile crocodiles and hippopotamus, two animals which were widespread in the delta during antiquity, are no longer found there. Fish found in the delta include the Striped mullet and soles.\n\nClimate\n\nThe Delta has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) as the rest of Egypt, but its northernmost part, as is the case with the rest of the northern coast of Egypt which is the wettest region in the country, has relatively moderate temperatures, with highs usually not surpassing 31 °C in the summer. Only 100–200 mm of rain falls on the delta area during an average year, and most of this falls in the winter months. The delta experiences its hottest temperatures in July and August, with maximum average of 34 °C. Winter temperatures are normally in the range of 9 °C at nights to 19 °C at days. With cooler temperatures and some rain, the Nile Delta region becomes quite humid during the winter months.\n\nSea level\n\nFurthermore, Egypt’s Mediterranean coastline is being swallowed up by the sea because of global warming and the rise of the sea level, and the lack of sediments being deposited since the construction of the Aswan Dam, in some places as much as 100 yards a year.  As the polar ice caps melt, much of the northern delta, including the ancient port city of Alexandria, will disappear under the Mediterranean. A 30-centimeter rise in sea level is expected to occur by 2025, flooding approximately 200 km2.  The Nile Delta is turning into a salty wasteland by rising sea waters, forcing some farmers off their lands and others to import sand in a desperate bid to turn back the tide. Experts warn that global warming will have a major impact in the delta on agriculture resources, tourism and human migration besides shaking the region's fragile ecosystems. Environmental damage to the Nile Delta is not yet one of Egypt's priorities, but experts say if the situation continues to deteriorate, it will trigger massive food shortages which could turn seven million people into \"climate refugees\" by the end of the century if climate change is mitigated. \n\nGovernorates\n\n*Alexandria\n*Beheira\n*Kafr el Sheikh\n*Gharbiya\n*Minufiya\n*Qalyubiya\n*Dakahlia\n*Damietta\n*Sharqiyah\n*Port Said\n\nLarge cities located in the Nile Delta:\n*Abusir\n*Alexandria\n*Avaris\n*Bilbeis\n*Bubastis\n*Canopus\n*Damanhur\n*Desouk\n*Damietta\n*El-Mahalla El-Kubra\n*Kafr el-Sheikh\n*Leontopolis\n*Mendes\n*Mit Abu al-Kum\n*Mansoura\n*Naucratis\n*Pelusium\n*Port Said\n*Rosetta\n*Sais\n*Tanis\n*Tanta\n*Zagazig"

                "A Brief History Of Front-Wheel Drive\nA Brief History Of Front-Wheel Drive\nHugo Becker of BMWBLOG breaks down the history of front-wheel-drive vehicles in the face of a wrong-wheel-drive Bavarian future. — Ed.\nAdvertisement\nIn the beginning was the Cugnot artillery tractor . More than one version of the three-wheeled, front-wheel-drive steamer came off the drawing boards in the second half of the eighteenth century. The apocryphal story tells that it plowed off the outside of a corner and into a wall. And thus driven front wheels and understeer were forever linked.\nThe United States Enters The Fray\nFast forward to the opening years of the twentieth century and a cantankerous designer-inventor by the name of John Walter Christie . He created a series of transverse-engined front-wheel-drive monsters that were raced at fairgrounds across the United States. They were technological dead ends, and while seven were built, none are known to have survived.\nIn the 1920s, a Kansas City businessman named Ben F. Gregory built around ten front-wheel-drive cars immediately after World War I. These cars had longitudinally mounted engines with a transmission in the nose connected to a front differential. Gregory employed a novel solution to allow power and steering to take place on the same axle, adopting a de Dion tube for the front end of his vehicles.\nAdvertisement\nAround the same time, motorsport visionary Harry Miller was approached by board-track hero Jimmy Murphy and his mechanic Riley Brett and asked to build a front-wheel-drive board-track \"killer\". Miller suggested a transverse engine layout, but Murphy and Brett wanted a longitudinal layout in order to minimize the car's frontal area. Miller did that, and the race car that resulted cleaned up its oval-track competition. He used Ben Gregory's de Dion front suspension in the process. Once tweaked and cleaned up a little by C. W. van Ranst , his design formed the basis of the Cord L29 .\nWhat's interesting is that Miller and Gregory worked with Christie during World War I, and that Riley Brett had experience building cars in Kansas City at the end of war. Unfortunately, beyond those superficial connections, no real ties have been proven to exist between those men.\nUp to this point, front-wheel-drive had been hampered by the lack of a solution to the odd pulsating motion that universal joints are subject to when deflected at large angles. This normally isn't a problem on unsteered wheels (or, for that matter, on a rear-wheel-drive driveshaft) as the vertical motion of suspension travel is generally less than that of the horizontal angles necessary for steering.\nEffect of angular displacement on universal joint. From Wikipedia.\nBack to France\nAll roads lead to France at this juncture, even though constant-velocity (CV) joints were beginning to be developed elsewhere. A firm known as Tracta was founded to build cars that demonstrated a new, easily manufactured CV joint. It was developed by Jean-Albert Gregorie (odd there's another ‘Gregory' in the mix). This joint was picked up by the German firm NAG and used in cars like the Adler Trumpf . DKW also took interest in the joint and applied it to their two-stroke, transverse-engine \"kleinwagen\" car. Other CV joints, built by companies like Rzeppa (Ford) and Weiss (Bendix), were available at the same time, but Germany and France were the innovators, and the Citroen Traction Avant was seen as something of a breakthrough.\nAcross the Channel\nIn the mid 1950s, automotive designer Alex Issigonis found himself back at Morris, then part of the British Motor Corporation (BMC). His brief was to lay out three new cars, and work was well underway on the first two when the Suez crisis intervened. As a result of the subsequent charge towards small cars, Issignois was approached by BMC's chairman, Leonard Lord , and asked to develop a \"proper\" small car unlike the \"bloody bubble cars\". The assignment dovetailed neatly with Issigonis's minimalist thinking — he had wanted to do another small car after his well-received penning of the Morris Minor.\nAdvertisement\nSponsored\nThe thinking for third proposal was to maximize passenger space. Issigonis started drawing and calculating space on one of his ubiquitous sketch pads. The idea for the original Mini was to stuff five people and their gear into 10 feet of car along with an engine, transmission, differential, wheel wells, suspension, and all the other bits needed to make the car roadworthy. This constraint of the car's length led to the two-box design that went against prevailing styling norms.\nIssigonis had previously experimented with transverse front-wheel drive on a modified Morris Minor, but up to that point, no one had attempted to mass-produce such a vehicle. He utilized a Hardy-Spicer Birfield joint (a license-built Rzeppa), previously used in submarines, to send power to the front wheels. Another issue was the potential intrusion of the wheel wells on passenger space. The solution to this was sourcing a ten-inch wheel and leaning on Dunlop to build an appropriate tire.\nAdvertisement\nThe suspension had to accommodate the space restrictions and the potential for the payload to equal the unladen weight of the car. Coil or leaf springs wouldn't work, and the hoped-for Hydrolastic suspension wasn't yet far enough along for a production vehicle. Instead, the initial production vehicles utilized specially developed rubber-cone springs and shock absorbers. (Hydrolastic suspension was incorporated into the car later in production.)\nThe Mini, which was initially targeted at adults, took a while to become hip. It took the children of those adults to turn it into a hit. And the Mini became the future.\nThe Road To Ubiquity\nThe Mini started the trend towards front-wheel-drive ubiquity, but the Fiat 128 added momentum. While Audi and GM (Toronado and Eldorado) still used a longitudinal engine placement, more and more manufacturers migrated to transverse layouts. This was to the detriment of long-standing rear-engine, rear-wheel drive vehicles like the Fiat 500/600/850, the Renault 4CV, the Chevy Corvair, and Volkswagen's entire lineup.\nAdvertisement\nIn time, all major entry and mid-market manufacturers would come to rely on front-wheel drive for the bulk of their offerings. Mercedes-Benz and BMW remained the lone holdouts — and while Audi and Subaru offer all-wheel-drive, those offerings are derivatives of front-wheel-drive antecedents.\nWhat Will BMW Do?\nBMW has announced that it is planning to build a subcompact (B-class) BMW-badged front-wheel-drive car in addition to its planned potential Project i models. Why would the Bavarians do this? The logical explanation is that emissions and fuel economy requirements in world markets require a lightweight anchor for more extravagant offerings (X5 M, 760Li, etc). There may be engineering reasons for choosing FWD over anything else, but history shows that rear-engined, rear-wheel-drive cars often die when their parent companies make the move toward front-wheel drive.\nAdvertisement\nWhile this new front-wheel-drive BMW will be available in Europe, it's uncertain whether or not BMW of North America will want it. After all, it represents the potential dilution of the company's brand image in the vital North American market. And historically, Americans have rejected premium small cars. (There are a couple of exceptions and cars like potential ‘Project i' vehicles may have an impact here.) That said, 35-mpg CAFE targets are looming, and we're seeing BMW's migration to smaller, high-tech, turbocharged motors as a result. The question for BMW of America is whether or not it can make its CAFE target without an entry-level front-wheel-drive car. I believe that they'll do everything in their power to meet the CAFE goal without importing a premium front-wheel-drive model.\nBMWBLOG offers daily roundel-flavored news, reviews, rumors, and history.",
                "Front Wheel Drive Chapter 3\nThe story of  pioneers of the front wheel drive motorcar\nPart Three Consolidation Years\nThe 1920’s were years of experiment, with finally the production of a small number of specialist front wheel drive cars, sports and luxury, all relatively costly. The 1930’s saw these joined by front wheel drive cars at the other end of the price range.\nIn Britain BSA made 10,000 of a varied range of three and four wheeled car from 1929 to 1940.\nIn Germany DKW started making their series of cars prefixed “F”, making over 200,000 by 1939. In the middle of the price range Adler produced the “Trumpt” and “Trumpt Junior” in large numbers, and Audi produced the “Front”, the first in a long and distinguished line of front wheel drive cars with the Audi name.\nIn France, Citroen began their long association with front wheel drive in 1934 with the “Traction Avant”, and J.A. Gregiore created for Hotchkiss, the “Amilcar Compound”, which was made in relatively small numbers from 1938 to 1940. There was also front wheel drive models from Georges Irat.\nCord in the USA return in 1936 with the 810 and 812.\nBSA\nThe first inexpensive front wheel drive vehicle to reach the British market, the BSA “Three Wheeler Twin”, although not mass produced, was made in large numbers compared with it’s predecessors and could not have been more different.\nB.S.A. three-wheeler 1929\nA three wheeled cyclecar, as ultra light cars were then described. The specification in many respects was normal, being similar in layout to the “Morgan” three wheeler. With two wheels at the front and one wheel at the rear and a 1021 c.c. Vee twin-cylinder air-cooled engine was mounted in front. A simple channel-section chassis that was formed in the rear with a large-diameter central tube; the single rear wheel was mounted on a hinged arm having as an extension a leaf spring that was enclosed within the central chassis tube.\nThe major difference was the transmission that was similar in layout to the Alvis 12/75 including the inboard drum brakes. Four quarter elliptic springs each side were used for the independent front suspension. A four wheeled version was available only in 1932, the FW32. In 1933 a four-cylinder engine version of the three and four-wheeled car was added to the range. With a 1075c.c.side-valve water-cooled engine in place of the twin being the only major change. The three wheeled cars were dropped after 1936, the “Scout” series of cars being available from 1935 to 1940, being the last BSA cars.\n1938 BSA Scout\nDKW\nThe company DKW was founded by Jorgen Skafte Rasmussen, a Danish engineer. The initials DKW came from an unsuccessful venture, a steam powered vehicle, in German Dampt Kraft Wagon. Fortunately the company became successful as motorcycle manufacturers, with a factory at Zschopen in the German region of Saxony. Between 1919 and 1930 the company made an assortment of rear wheel drive cyclecars and lightcars. The first front wheel drive car from DKW, the FA, later to be called the F-1, was introduced in 1931. It was an ultra lightweight car, weighing only 450kg. It had a water-cooled 2 cylinder 2stroke engine, mounted transversely in the chassis, with the 3- speed gearbox in front and the final drive assembly in front of that between the front wheels,\n  J.S. Rasmussen\n  The DKW FA powerunit.\nTwin transverse ½ elliptic springs were used at the front and the rear of the steel ladder chassis for the all independent suspension. With 15bhp from the engine a maximum speed of 75kpm was attained.  It was made in roadster, cabriolet and saloon form. After the first revolutionary step of producing the FA, the F series of cars that followed evolved, with changes introduced as the model numbers progressed. The F-2 a 584cc engined version of the F-1 was introduced in 1933, with a little more power and a little more speed. An engine capacity of 584cc was available until 1938.The F-4 of 1934 saw the spur gear drive between the engine and gearbox replaced with a chain. The F-5 also of 1934 had major engine changes using the Schnuerle deflectorless-piston loopscavenge system, which made an important contribution to efficient two-stroke engine operation.\nDKW F2 chassis.\nThe rear suspension was changed to a dead axle and a transverse leaf spring.The F-5 was also available with 684cc engine. The F-7 had the front suspension changed to one leaf spring and wishbones.\nDKW F2\n The last model before the Second World War was the F-8. That had a revised chassis frame incorporating rack and pinion steering and an engine of 589cc. In 1939 a 692cc engine was fitted in some models and was made until 1942.\nAfter the war, two versions of the F series were produced. The factory at Zwickau were the DKW were produced before the war was then in the DDR, the eastern communist part of Germany and a car named the IFA F-8 was produced there from 1948 until 1955.The second F series car the DKW F-89 was made in Dusseldorf in West German, by the pre-war management. Based on the F-8 but with the 684cc engine moved ahead of the front wheels. This was in production from 1950 until 1954. Between 1931 and 1955 around 300,000 FA’s to F-89’s had been made. These cars can justifiably be claimed to the first mass produced front wheel drive cars, the fore runner’s to all the millions produced since.\nDKW F5 chassis.\nJ.S. Rasmussen the founder of DKW took over the ailing Audi concern in 1928, making DKW along side the Audi’s at their Zwickau factory. To counter the worsening economic crisis in the German motor industry, in 1932, DKW, Audi and two other motor manufacturers located in Saxony Wanderer and Horch, merged to form Auto Union AG. One of the first products of the merger was the Audi “Front”, which was as inferred by it’s name was a front wheel drive car. It had a 2.3 litre six-cylinder engine designed by Professor Porsche and made by Wanderer. That was mounted behind the final drive and four-speed gearbox as in the Tracta. With power steering system made under licence to a US design combined with a ZF steering box. The box section backbone chassis had  transverse leaf springs front and rear, combined with wishbones at the front and swing axles at the rear. The cars place in the market was similar the Audi’s produced today, being of medium price and high quality. It was made from 1933 to 1938 in the Horch factory in Zwickau.\n  1934 Audi Front\nAdler.\nAdler of Franfurt-on Main, Germany, started by making bicycles in 1880, later typewriters and commenced car production in 1900.\nThe first of their front wheel drive cars, the Trumpf, was designed by the company technical director of the time, Rohr. This was in 1932. As well as front wheel drive, the car had other advanced features, The body was electrically welded to the box section chassis, making it a near monocoque. All independent suspension using torsion bars and rack and pinion steering. The layout of the power train was similar to the Tracta and the Alvis, with the final drive at the front, with the four-speed gearbox next and then the engine. This resulted in a long bonnet, which fortunately was still fashionable at the time. Tracta joints were used in the outboard end of the transmission. The car was light for its time, being just over a thousand kilos in 4-seat saloon form.\nThe engine and the brakes were as most other cars of that date, the engine being a side-valve, four, of 1500cc to 1700cc producing 38bhp to 40bhp, and the brakes were mechanically operated.\n  Adler Trumpf\nThe Trumpf-Junior, a smaller version of the Trumpf, also designed by Rohr, with a 995cc engine, was produced from 1934. Both cars were available in five body styles.\nBy 1941 when all Adler car production ceased. It was not to resume after the war. Just over twenty five thousand Trumpf's also almost one hundred and three thousand Trumpt-Juniors had been made.\nAdler Trumpf-Junior\nCord.\nIn 1936 another car bearing the name \"Cord\" was produced, the V-8 engined 810.  It is mainly remembered for its stunning body style, designed by Gordon Buehig it was an instant classic. This time the designers had got the layout right, with the gearbox, a four -speed Bendix preselector unit, ahead of the final-drive unit and the engine behind, making a much more compact assembly. Front suspension was by independent trailing arms and a transverse leaf spring. The engine, a 288.6 cubic inch Lycoming product, produced 125bhp in basic form, but a supercharged version could be fitted producing 190bhp,with a top speed of 110mph. A longer wheelbase version was also produced the 812, but a combined total of less than three thousand examples of  the 810 and 812 were made by the time the Cord empire collapsed in 1937.\nCitroen\nAndre Citroen, set a design team to work on the car that was to become the Traction Avant in 1932. He had decided to produce a car of advanced specification that would replace all his existing models. The whole car was to be completely new.\nIt would have front wheel drive and a low profile similar to the Adler Trumpf, combined with a monocoque chassis/body unit, built using the Budd process. Another feature to be incorporated into the design and almost it's undoing, was the use of a torque converter in place of a conventional gearbox.\nAs is the practice today, the \"Traction Avant\", was designed by a team, each being a specialist in the various components. The design team leader was Andre Lefebvre. Andre Citroen had recruited him for the task when the project was falling behind schedule. Citroen had taken a licence, and purchased machinery from America, to manufacture the \"Rzappa joint\".\nAn early 7cv Traction Avant\nThis was to be used at the outboard end of the drive shafts. But then thought better of it.\nIt would be almost thirty years before versions of the \"Rzappa joint\" were used successfully in mass-produced cars. Then J.A.Gregoire was retained as a transmission consultant. \"Tracta joints\" were fitted to the prototypes and some early production cars, but proved unsatisfactory. According to J.A. Gregoire's account, this was due to poor quality machining. The \"Tracta joints\", were then replaced by the double Hardy Spicer joints that were used through out the life of the car. The drive joints were not the only problem with the early cars. The torque converter proved to be unsuitable for the car and if the design team had not produced a conventional gearbox quickly the whole project would have failed. The layout of the power train was more compact than the Tracta's and the Adler's, in that the gearbox was ahead of the final drive, with engine behind and the weight distribution was improved as a conscience.\n                                                                                 Citroen “Traction Avant” power train. The gear box is on the left, ahead of the final drive\nThe suspension was independent on all wheels with torsion bar springs and at first friction dampers. The friction damper, were replaced by telescopic hydraulic dampers in 1935. The steering gearbox was initially of worm and sector type, but was discarded for rack and pinion in 1936. Hydraulic brakes completed an advanced specification. Over two hundred and eighty thousand of the various 7cv and 11cv models were produced between 1934 and 1940. But Andre Citroen did not live to see the Traction Avant flourish. The early problems with the car, ruined Citroen and the company past to other hand, soon after which Andre Citroen died.",
                "The history of Citroen\nan anniversary of a famous company:\n75 years of Citroën automobiles;\n60 years of Citroën Traction Avant\n75 years ago the interesting and colourful history of Citroën automobiles          began. In 1934, Citroën presented their first front-wheel drive cars and          started a revolution in auto production.\nAndré Citroën was born in 1878. A successful student, he attended the Polytechnical school in Paris and worked for some time with the car company \"Mors\". In 1905, at the          age of 27, he founded his first company, \"André Citroën & Cie\", which was changed to \"Société des Engrenages          Citroën\" (Citroën Cog Factory ) in 1913. Also in 1913,          Citroën founded yet another company to take advantage of a patent he had          regarding carburettors. This company was located on the Quai de Javel          (today Quai André Citroën) in Paris. Early in his career, Citroën          was impressed by the production methods of Henry Ford ,          who pioneered the use of the assembly line as early as 1908 for the Ford Model          T in the U.S.A. Citroën understood that he had to analyse production          methods and that he had to divide it into single logical steps in order to          calculate the industrial production of an item mathematically.\nWith the outbreak of World War I, André Citroën received a commission,          beginning in 1915, to produce 7,500 75mm grenades - good work for a small company.          Citroën was able to convince the French Ministry of Defence that he could          deliver much bigger quantities with industrial production. The company grew          rapidly and in 1918 it occupied 80,000 square metres at the Quai de Javel in Paris where, in 1914, there were still garden allotments. 12,000 people were occupied          producing grenades. At the peak the output reached 20,000 pieces! The company was          very progressive in the social field: a cantine and a kindergarden were present          as was a dental clinic. During the war, Citroën started thinking about the \"days after\". He talked about building 1,000 automobiles a day at a          price that would enable everyone to own one of his cars.\n1919: The first \"Citroën\"...\nBy 1919, the first Citroën auto was produced - the Type A. Equipped with a          4-cylinder engine of 1326 cubic cm (10-fiscal-HP) capacity, it was capable of a          top speed of 65km/h. One was able to order six different body styles directly          from the factory, this at a time where one got the chassis and the engine from          other makers and had it completed by a coachworks of your own choice! Even the          spare wheel and the lighting were included in the price of F7,205. From June to          December 1919, Citroën produced 2,500 cars. In 1920, they had already produced          20,200!\nAlso in 1920, Citroën first tested half-track autos called \"Autochenilles\" using the patents of Adolphe Kégresse. In          impassable regions they were very useful, and their reliability helped to          improve the reputation of Citroën as an automobile manufacturer. The          half-tracks were not only used by the armed forces, in road-building and          agriculture, but also by different post offices, among them the Swiss PTT          which equipped their \"Autochenilles\" with skis at the front.\nIn 1921, the first Citroën Taxis appeared on the streets of Paris. The big          news at the Paris Motor Show in October was the 5 hp Type C, a real car for the          people with 856 cubic cm engine, 60 km/h top speed, available as a Torpedo with          two seats. The car was first available in the summer of 1922 and was sold only          in one colour: lemon yellow.\nThe small car was a real success. In 1924, it was presented as a three-seater.          The third seat was in the rear in the middle and the passenger put his feet between          the two front seats. This version, named the \"Trèfle\" (Clover Leaf) gained a great deal of fame. Up to March 1926, it stayed in          production with only minor changes - about 90,000 were built and quite a          number still exist today.\nAfter the B12 of 1925, the B14 was introduced in 1927, driven by a 1538 cubic cm          engine with 22 true horsepower. It was followed by the C4 in 1929. Also in 1929,          the C6 was introduced - the first six cylinder Citroën (2442 cubic cm), and          the first Citroën to reach 100 km/h.\nAndré Citroën was very successful in drawing the public's attention          with elaborate publicity campaigns. In 1922, airplanes wrote the name \"Citroën\" in the sky over Paris; in 1925 the name \"Citroën\" could have been read on the Eiffel tower :          200,000 lightbulbs were necessary and several kilometers of cabling!\nExpeditions...\nFrom 17 December 1922 to 7 January 1923, a Citroën expedition crossed the          Sahara desert by automobile for the first time, from Algiers to Timbuktu, a          distance of 3,200 kms, averaging 150 kms a day with 10hp B2 half-tracks - an          enormous effort for the period!\nFrom 28 October 1924 to 26 June 1925, a further expedition, the famous \"Croisière Noire\" (Black Journey) crossed the African continent          from Algeria through Kenya to the Cape of Good Hope.\nOn 4 April 1931, the \"Croisère Jaune\" (Yellow Journey) started          in Beruit. The goal was to reach Beijing with the C4 and C6 type half-tracks.          In between there were deserts, glaciers, mountains, and war zones. One C4F          reached 4,208m and set a world altitude record for cars. In the Himalayas, part          of the way through, the paths were not driveable and the cars had to be taken          apart, carried through, and rebuilt afterwards! On 12 February, 1932 the cars          triumphantly reached Beijing.\nRecords...\nFrom the beginning of 1932, the C4 and C6 were equipped with the \"Floating          Power\" engine which was mounted in a new way, using a Chrysler patent. The engine was secured with rubber mounts instead of being bolted directly          to the chassis, thereby eliminating major engine vibrations. The first cars using          this new engine mounting were recognizeable with a stylized swan in front of the          Citroën double chevrons.\nBy the end of 1932, the types \"8\", \"10\", and \"15\" followed, called \"Rosalie\" after a Citroën \"Rosalie 8\" which covered 300,000 km in 134 days with an average of more than 93 km/h and          breaking not less that 106 world records! More runs of the same kind followed and          proved the reliability of the small Citroën.\nAndré Citroën advertised his products not just to adults. Soon he          produced toy cars to capture the attention of children - his future customers.          The first words he wanted them to be able to speak were: \"Mama, Papa,          Citroën\".\nFinancial problems...\nThe first clouds on the Citroën horizon appeared after the Wall Street crash          of October 1929 and the ensuing world crisis. In 1933, at the peak of the crisis,          Citroën rebuilt the factories at the Quai de Javel completely, in order to          have sufficient capacity to produce his impending new model. Enormous halls were          built. 6,000 guests were invited to the grand opening.\nThe rebuild was a big challenge for the company. In April 1933, t here was a          strike which served to amplify the difficulties. The cars didn't sell well          abroad because of the exchange rates and the restrictions certain countries          introduced against foreign products. By the end of 1933, Citroën had so          many debts, that the Michelin company had to be called for financial help.\nWith front wheel drive to the future...\nWithin a short period the Traction Avant Type \"7\" was developed - a car          that was radically different in all respects to other cars of the time:          self-supporting uni-body, front-wheel drive, torsion bar suspension, to mention          only the most important features. The first plans even called for an automatic          two-speed transmission - a feature that had to be dropped. The most significant          feature was that the car was about 20 cm lower than its predecessors and          contemporaries - with equal or even more interior space. Thanks to the low          center of gravity and front-wheel drive, the Traction Avant has superb road-holding.\nIn April 1934, production started - at the beginning with 1303 cubic cm and 32 hp          (good enough for 95 km/h) but lots of small problems. In the same year, much better          versions with 1529 cubic cm and 1911 cubic cm (7S for Sport - top speed 110 km/h)          were presented. The car was then called the \"11CV\" and made the name \"Traction Avant\" known world-wide. With only small changes it stayed          in production until 1957.\nThe following body styles were offered by the Citroën factory:\nShorter wheel base called the \"Légère\": Berline,           Cabriolet, and Faux-Cabriolet (Coupé)\n12cm wider and medium (20 cm longer) wheelbase, called \"Large\":           Berline, Cabriolet, and Faux-Cabriolet\nSame size but even longer (a further 20cm) wheelbase: the Familiale and           Conduite Intérieure.\nIn 1934, about twelve of the famous 8-cylinder prototypes with front-wheel drive         were built - the \"22CV\". Three of them were presented to the public on         the occasion of the Paris Auto Show. They never saw series production and none of         them are known to exist today.\nDuring the same car show, Citroën showed a publicity film in which you          can see a new Traction Avant being pushed over the edge of a 8 m high cliff.          It lands on its nose, is thrown back, lands on its nose again, and sits on its          four wheels after rolling. Only one window is broken, all doors open and close.          The car drives off by its own means!\nBy this time all weaknesses in the 4-cylinder model were eliminated, but for          André Citroën it was too late. By 21 December 1934, the company          went into bankruptcy. André Citroën died as a poor broken man on 3          July 1935.\nUnder Michelin the company developed further. At the beginning of 1939, the 11CV Commerciale on          the long wheelbase was presented. More importantly, the Traction Avant 15/Six was          introduced with a top speed of 130 km/h and its legendary driving abilities. Its          2867 cubic cm 6-cylinder with 77 hp gave the \"Reine de la Route\" (Queen of the Road) abilities that are still quite modern today. As the          underworld also liked this special fast car, it was soon known as the \"gangster limousine\". The police with the 4-cylinder models had          great difficulties following their \"enemies\".\nDuring WWII the production practically stopped. The available cars were used          by the German occupying forces and by the French Résistance. After the          war the pre-war models were produced again, but only a limited range was offered.          The cars were still liked by business people, doctors, and rich farmers. In the          years following WWII, most of the Tractions were delivered in black and that's          how most people remember them.\nUnfortunately the Cabriolets and Coupés were not built any more after          the war. Only some coach builders are producing small series or single items of          the open cars. In Switzerland these are famous companies like \"Langenthal\", \"Worblaufen\" and \"Beutler\".\nDuring the Paris Car Show of 1948 the 2CV was introduced. Smiled at by all, this comfortable small car of 375 cubic cm          started a long life around the world.\nIn 1955, we start to see the end of the Traction Avant. \"La          Déesse\" , \"The Goddess\", was presented and the automobile          world was once more astonished by Citroën. \"This is not the car of          tomorrow, it's the car of today. It's just that all the other cars are from          yesterday...\" was one of the publicity slogans. Indeed, it was and          continues to be an unusual streamlined car - with front-wheel drive, height          adjustable hydraulic suspension, power steering, semi-automatic gear box,          one spoke safety steering wheel, and much more.\nNevertheless it took up to 25 July 1957 until the last of the famous Tractions,          an 11CV Familiale, rolled off the production line.\nThe legend lives on!\nToday, the owners and friends of the Traction Avant are united in classic car          clubs all over the world. Spare parts are reproduced, meetings are held .          In Switzerland there must be about 1000 of the varying Traction Avant versions left.\nDaniel Eberli, 1994",
                "Lane Motor Museum Oddball Cars You've Never Heard Of\n3. Dealer Selection\nReceive your free dealer pricing information by completing your contact information!\nI’ve been into cars since birth. I’ve been writing about them for a quarter century, and I’ve attended a gillion car-club shows and concours d’elegance, so it’s always a special treat when I encounter some rare, obscure car or marque I never knew existed. Well, in Nashville, Tennessee, there is a special little heaven on earth for people like me called the Lane Motor Museum. This very special collection is absolutely chock-full-o surprisingly delightful examples of the automotively obscure and unknown. Many of the kookiest cars and trucks in the collection are laughably bad home-built one-offs hacked together by car-guy Rube Goldbergs who paid no attention to many decades of accumulated automotive wisdom. (The collection includes not one but TWO one-off rear-V-8-engined, front-wheel-drive, three-wheeled, single-rear-steer abominations !) Herewith, nine volume-production car marques that were new to me and 11 more crazy cars I’d never seen.\nAero\nThe Aero company was founded in Czechoslovakia in 1925 to build airplanes but, like Sweden’s Saab, tried its hand at cars between 1928 and 1947 and became the country’s fourth largest automaker (behind Tatra, Praga—another unknown—and Škoda). The Model 30 was its most popular, and Lane has two examples—a low-slung four-seat cabriolet from 1934 and a closed coupe from 1936. The impossibly low (for the day) bodywork and flat floor are made possible by the longitudinal two-stroke, 28-hp two-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive, and by the four-wheel independent suspension with frame-mounted pure trailing arm rear suspension. The floor is also aerodynamically flat underneath. Production: 7,780.\nA.B.C.\nThe All British (engine) Company started out in 1911 making air-cooled flat-twin engines for motorcycles and cycle-cars and then graduated to manufacturing full motorcycles. They entered the air-cooled car biz in 1920 with a conventional-looking design that used the “radiator” as a fuel tank (frequently leading to disastrous “topping up” with water by unfamiliar mechanics and fuel-station attendants). They fled the car biz after 1925 but continued making engines for compressors and the like until 1971 (as a part of Vickers at the end). Production: ~1,500\nGeorges Irat\nThe company name Georges Irat was incorporated around 1914 in France, but car production didn’t happen until 1921 and remained rather teetering through the 1920s. Then a partnership with engine-makers Godefroy and Lévcque secured a supply of small “Ruby” engines. At that point a sporty FWD, 1,100cc 6CV roadster model like this 1938 model arrived on the scene to stave off financial ruin. That one looked sportier than it drove, but when the Ruby engine supply dried up in 1939, the subsequent 11CV model (like Lane’s 1940 model) got a 2.0-liter Citroën engine and four-wheel independent suspension with rubber springs. The company stayed in business until 1953. Production: ~1,500 6CVs, 600 11CVs\nRovin\nRobert and Raul de Rovin got into the cyclecar and motorcycle biz in the 1920s and really capitalized on France’s need for low-cost basic transportation after the war. The D4 appeared in 1950 as its most sophisticated model to date and met with reasonable success, powered by a 462cc, 13-hp, four-stroke two-banger. Production of the D4 ended sometime after this 1953 model was built, and the company folded in 1961. Production: 1,203 D4s\nMochet\nCharles Mochet actually built pedal cars that adults used to get around from 1927 until the outbreak of WWII. (France truly is like a whole other country, n’est pas?) After World War II Mochet converted its cars to engine propulsion, and this 1956 CM-125Y is so named for its 125cc Ydral engine. In those days no driving license was required for cars with 125cc engines; a 175cc variant was also available for licensed drivers. Production: ~3,000\nMaico\nOK, if you’re into dirt bike racing history, you may know the Maico name, as this company made the bike to run in motocross enduros back in the ’70s. The German Maisch brothers got their start in 1926 building two-stroke engines under license and manufacturing bike parts. Later, incorporated as Maico Werke GmbH, they purchased the Champion microcar company to seize on the growing postwar demand for cheap transportation. In 1956, they stretched the Maico 400 chassis to accommodate four passengers but didn’t fully engineer the resulting Maico 500 (the Lane owns a ’58), and the added weight overwhelmed the front axle. This lead to excessive warranty claims and ultimately doomed the car business. Production: 6,301\nOpperman\nEuropean postwar demand for cheap cars was so great that it drew people in from every tangential manufacturing business. Opperman was a British tractor company that commissioned Lawrie Bond (of three-wheeler Bond Minicar fame) to pen a cheap mini for them. The resulting mid-engine, rear-drive design (just like McLaren !) uses four wheels but puts the rears close enough together to negate the need for a costly differential. The steel-bodied Opperman Unicar made its debut as the cheapest car at the 1956 London Motor Show, claiming to offer big-car comfort. But despite the low price (£400, or $1,125) sales were slow. Production ceased in 1959. Production: ~200\nNew-Map\nIn yet another motorcycles-to-microcars tale, the French New-Map company found plenty of takers for its line of Solyto three-wheelers. It was offered in three body styles: Fourgonnette Tolee (panel van), Break-Camping (window van), and Fourgonnette Bachee (as shown with a canvas top). They featured a single steered wheel in front that also carried the tiny two-stroke, 125cc Ydral one-lung motor, providing front-wheel drive. Concerns about overwhelming the contact patch might be assuaged by the fact that output was just 5.5 hp, just as performance worries might be calmed by the fact that it only weighed 330 pounds. The crazy name comes from SOciete LYonaise de TOlerie, New-Map’s sheetmetal division. This is a 1959 model, but production spanned from 1952 to 1974. Production: 4,000\nBaldi\nCarrozziere G.A.M.C. Baldi, of San Remo, Italy, built a line of Fiat 500-based Frog microcars aimed at urban buyers for whom parking and traffic were major daily challenges. The angular fiberglass bodywork measures just 85 inches long—4 inches shorter than a Smart car and 20 inches shorter than the 500 it borrowed running gear from. The two-stroke engine choices ranged from 125cc to 595cc. The Lane’s 1975 Baldi Frog is the muscle car of the bunch, fitted with the big 595cc engine and specced for rally duty. Production: 300\nEleven More Little Known Cars\nNon-egg-shaped Tatras\nHans Ledwinka was an automotive genius and was chief engineer at Tatra by 1921, when the company was still making front-engine, rear-drive vehicles. Earlier vehicles like the Lane’s 1927 T-12 truck featured innovations like a rigid tubular backbone chassis through which the driveshaft ran and a fully independent rear suspension with transverse leaf springs, as clearly shown by the bare-nekkid 1932 T-57 chassis on display. Early Tatra front engine covers are aerodynamically shaped to resemble a period Renault. No radiator was necessary, because the engines were air-cooled. And even after the better-known aero-lozenge rear-V-8-powered T-87 flagship hit the road, the conventional-looking 25-hp four-cylinder T-57 sold in far greater numbers. Production: T-12, 7,525; T-57, 26,540\nWankel-Powered Citroën\nWe all know that NSU was first to market with a Wankel, that GM spent a lot of money developing the Wankel rotary engine, that this powertrain was also intended for the original AMC Pacer, and that Mazda is the only company that really made the concept work. How many of us knew that in 1970 Citroën built a fleet of Ami 8 coupe look-alikes powered by Wankels? Not I. The plan was to build and sell (for 14,000 francs, or about $2,525), 500 M-35 “prototypes” to gain real-world experience. To sweeten the deal, they were provided with unlimited warranties. The engines didn’t run too well, and they cost a fortune in warranty work, so by 1974 the warranty was canceled and a generous buy-back program was announced. Production: 267\nHobbycar B 612\nI vaguely remember seeing stories about this crazy amphibian with the Alfa 164 taillights back when it was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in 1992, but I have never seen one in the flesh. This is one of the prototypes, powered by a Peugeot diesel engine mounted transversely amidships driving both the all-wheel terrestrial drive and the jet-drive for water use. A Citroën hydropneumatic suspension provided a range of ride heights and sucked the wheels high up into the bodywork when in the water. The seats could be turned around to face backward, but that 74-horse jet-drive with all this hydrodynamic drag couldn’t have made this much of a ski boat. With only about 4 inches of freeboard above the waterline, it was not suited to choppy waters. This plus the high price ($45,000) doomed sales, and the operation folded in 1996. Production: 52\nDKW Monza\nConceived as an aerodynamic speed-record car, this little beauty’s svelte fiberglass bodywork is draped over conventional two-stroke, 1.0-liter, 55-hp DKW 3=6 running gear. Weighing just 1,800 pounds with quick sports car steering, the Monza was reportedly quite fun to drive. The name was inspired by the prototype’s five speed records sets in 1956 at the Autodromo di Monza track in Italy, averaging 87 mph over a 72-hour period. Body production was contracted to three karosseries, none of whom kept very good records. This 1959 model was bodied by Robert Schenk of Stuttgart. Production: Unknown, but believed to be between 70 and 240\nHonda Vamos\nWho knew that Honda riffed on England’s Mini Moke, France’s Citroën’s (2CV) Méhari, and Germany’s (Beetle) Thing? Starting with its microcar kei-class mid-engine, 354cc, 30-hp, air-cooled two-cylinder TN360 van, Honda cut the bodywork down to minimalist standards, fashioned a canvas top, weatherproofed the upholstery and instruments, slapped a cutesie name on it, and sold it in the Japanese market between 1970 and 1973 for $3,095. Production: 2,500\nAutonacional Biscúter\nIf you’re thinking this one looks familiar, you may be remembering the Biscooter, designed by Gabriel Voisin for the French market. That one, named because it was the size of two scooters, was well designed but never sold well in France. Autonacional S.A. in Barcelona, Spain, licensed the design, making slight revisions to the aluminum bodywork and fitting a 9-hp, two-stroke, 197cc Hispano-Villiers engine. Later in the ’53-’63 model run (this is a 1956 Series 100) the Series 300 cars were made of steel. Production: 12,000\nFiat Giannini Camioncino\nRome-based Giannini Automobili S.p.A. has been tuning and revising Fiat cars for years. Back in the Fiat 500’s heyday it produced a run of 50 Camioncino pickup trucks, starting with the Giardiniera station wagon body and fitting a drop-side pickup box. Only three of these are believed to remain, and all three are said to be in Rome. This one appears to have been a one-off home-built homage to these Giannini Camioncinos, though it does without the drop-side box and gets a canvas cover instead. Production 50 (originals)\nCitroën Coal-roller\nDuring the German occupation of France, gasoline was extremely expensive if you could even find it. So various companies offered elaborate conversion setups to allow a gas-powered car to run on wood, coal, or charcoal. The firm F.A.P. Elgazo Tarbes produced the rig that’s glommed on to the Lane’s 1938 Citroën Berline 11CV Gazogene, allowing it to run on coal gas. One of the two large containers on the front fenders is filled with coal and ignited, producing methane gas that was then condensed, filtered, and fed to a special carburetor. It took 30 minutes from cold ignition before you could drive off, and then the horsepower was diminished by about a third, and the driving range of a single coal stash was just 30 miles. It’s believed 65,000 such alt-fuel systems by all suppliers were sold during the war, among which very few survive. Production: 200\nSimca Weekend\nSimca was founded by a Fiat employee sent to France to procure scrap metal. Instead he stayed, became the local Fiat distributor, and then when Fiat bought the former Donnet car factory in Nanterre, France, he headed up the resulting Société Industrielle de Mécanique et Carrosserie Automobile (SIMCA). Fiat ties faded postwar, and by 1951 the Aronde (French for swallow, as in the bird) became Simca’s first non-Fiat-influenced design. Flamboyant founder Henri Pigozzi wanted a convertible and commissioned Figoni to build a show car for 1953, but its structural rigidity was hopeless. The 1954 acquisition of Ford of France gained the company access to coachbuilder Facel, which built this gorgeous Weekend prototype. It was presented to a 19-year-old Brigitte Bardot for promotional purposes, and she drove it for years, but no other examples were produced.\nGoliath GP700\nGoliath had been known as a purveyor of three-wheeled vans and cars when this technologically advanced GP700 appeared at the Geneva show in 1950. An early adopter of the ponton-fender look, it bristled with other innovations like a transverse engine mounted directly over the front transaxle to maximize passenger space within the wheelbase. Later innovations would include all synchromesh transmission and in 1952 Bosch mechanical direct-injection—the first in a gasoline engine, beating the 1954 Mercedes -Benz W196 F1 engine and the 1955 300SL to market. The Lane’s 1957 GP700 E (for Einspritzung) is believed to be one of only five GP700s outside of Europe. Production: 36,524 (all styles)\nSZD Invalid Car\nHere’s a whole class of car I never heard of. Invalid cars. Originally designed to provide mobility for Russia’s disabled war veterans, they could only be procured through the social care system, leased for up to five years. Built by motorcycle-makers Serpukhov Motor Works, early examples were open-top three-wheelers with a top speed of 12 mph, but these proved wildly impractical in the Russian weather. Four wheelers that could manage 25 mph were introduced in 1958, and they were available with two control setups—one for use with two arms, one for use with one arm and one leg. The Lane’s 1980 SZD model is a later, improved design with a 17.5-hp, air-cooled, two-stroke IZh-3 motorcycle engine that can do a whopping 30 mph. It was produced from 1970 to 1997, but the total production is unknown.\nShare this article in:"

                "The Sam Browne belt is a wide belt, usually leather, supported by a narrower strap passing diagonally over the right shoulder. It is most often a part of a military or police uniform.\n\nOrigins\n\nSam Browne VC was a British army officer serving in India in the 19th century. In those days officers always carried a sword into battle. It hung from a small metal clip on the waistbelt, called a 'frog'. However, the scabbard tended to slide around a lot when they charged the enemy, meaning that it had to be steadied with the left hand before being drawn. \n\nDuring the Indian Rebellion of 1857 in India, Captain Sam Browne was serving with the 2nd Punjab Irregular Cavalry. On 31 August 1858, Captain Browne was involved in the fighting near Seerporah.   As he charged a cannon being reloaded, he was attacked by one of its crew. Browne received two sword cuts, one on the left knee and one which severed his left arm at the shoulder.  He survived the injuries but, without a left hand, he found that he was now unable to control or draw his sword.\n\nBrowne came up with the idea of wearing a second belt which went over his right shoulder and held the scabbard in just the spot he wanted. This would hook into a heavy leather belt with D-rings for attaching accessories. It also securely carried a pistol in a flap-holster on his right hip and included a binocular case with a neck-strap. Other cavalry officers in the Indian Army began wearing a similar rig and soon it became part of the standard uniform. During the Boer War, the rig was copied by Imperial and Commonwealth troops and eventually became standard issue. \n\nInfantry officers wore a variant that used two suspender-like straps instead of the cross-belt. It was supposedly invented in 1878 by Lieutenant Sir Basil Templer Graham-Montgomery, 5th Baronet of the 60th Rifles while serving in India. There has been a great deal of discussion as to whether Browne modified Graham-Montgomery's design or vice versa. Since there were no patents issued for either design and both camps have accounts backing up their claims, it may never be decided.\n\nUsage\n\nDue to its former use as equipment for carrying a sword, it is traditionally only worn by those to whom a sword would historically have been issued, namely officers and Warrant Officers (senior NCOs). Throughout most of its modern history, however, its main function has been to carry a pistol, and it was found to be particularly useful with the heavy pistols typically used during the first part of the 20th century.\n\nFinland\n\nIn the Finnish Army (as well as in Finnish Air Force) the Sam Browne belt, officially known as a \"command belt\" or \"officer belt\", has been used by officers and senior NCOs as well as officer cadets when wearing service, dress or parade uniforms. Currently it is mainly used by high-ranking officers during parades and other ceremonies, as it's only worn with dress uniform M58 and service uniform M83; while most Army and Air Force personnel, excluding cadets studying in the National Defence College as well as soldiers on ceremonial duties, use the camouflage uniform M05 as their service uniform, and the use of the \"command belt\" with any camouflage uniform except M62 (already phased out of service) is strictly forbidden.\n\nAxis powers\n\nThe Sam Browne belt featured prominently in many uniforms used by the Nazi Party in Germany, again in imitation of earlier European uniforms. It was popular with Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazi officials.   \n\nUnited Kingdom and the Commonwealth\n\nIn the 20th century it was a mainstay in the British Army officers' corps, being adopted service-wide in 1900 during the Second Boer War after limited use in India, and later becoming popular with military forces throughout the Commonwealth. \n\nAfter World War II the Sam Browne belt saw a decline in use in the Commonwealth. It was dropped from the standard officer's uniform in 1943.  However, officers, and Warrant Officer Class 1 (but not WO2) of the British Army and Royal Marines still wear it in formal (No.2) dress and in some versions of full (No.1) dress.\n\nIt was phased out by the Canadian military beginning with the unification of the armed services in 1968. \n\nIn Australia all officers are entitled to wear the belt in ceremonial dress; Warrant Officers bearing the rank of WO1 (but not WO2) are also entitled to wear the belt.  Within the corps of the Australian Army there is some variation, with members of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps and Australian Army Aviation Corps wearing black Sam Browne belts. \n\nRifle belt\n\nA different arrangement from the traditional Sam Browne belt consists of a similar wide belt with two vertical supporting straps, one over each shoulder. The design put the burden of the gear, with its heavy ammo pouches on the belt and straps, on both shoulders.\n\nIt was worn by the officers of British and Commonwealth Rifle Regiments, who had to carry a rifle as their service arm rather than a pistol. It was also worn by big game hunters in Africa and India in the late-19th and mid-20th centuries. It is often seen worn in movies or TV shows as part of the costume of explorers or big game hunters.   \n\t \nIts invention is falsely attributed to Sam Browne. It was actually invented by Lieutenant Basil Templer Graham-Montgomery of the 60th Rifles while he was on service in India. Although a case of simultaneous development, Graham-Montgomery was seen as a plagiarist.\n\nUnited States \n\nDuring World War I, the Sam Browne Belt was approved by General Pershing, commander of the AEF, for wear by American officers as a rank distinction. However, the Army as a whole did not immediately approve its use. MPs were positioned at stateside docks who confiscated them from returning officers.   The United States Army mandated the Sam Browne belt for overseas soldiers in 1918 under the name \"Liberty belt\" and for all service members in 1921, this time under the internationally accepted name \"Sam Browne belt\".   It was a standard part of the uniform between World War I and World War II. It was limited in use in 1940 when the Army abandoned sabers  and replaced with a cloth waistbelt that was sewn to the officer's jacket.\n\nDuring World War I the Marine Corps adopted a brown leather Sam Browne Belt. It was later changed to black, the official color of Navy and Marine Corps leather gear. It is worn as part of the dress uniform by sword-bearing commissioned officers and enlisted non-commissioned officers (minus the shoulder strap) in the Corps today. Senior Drill Instructors wear a modified version (again sans the shoulder strap) as a sign of their office during Recruit Training.\n\nAfter the First World War, Sam Browne belts \"become almost universal among American police\".  The utility belts worn today by American police usually lack the cross-strap and the attachments for them. The belt fastens in the same way, with the bar of the buckle engaging a pair of hooks and the end of the belt retained by a post and keeper loop.  They are also frequently fully lined, as opposed to the old style half-linings, to support equipment the length of the belt.\n\nUse in police forces worldwide\n\nThe Sam Browne belt is largely obsolete in police and security use due to risk of strangulation by potential opponents. It has sometimes been referred to as a Suicide Belt by personnel.   It had enjoyed some popularity with civilian police agencies worldwide and was probably most widely worn in this context during the 1940s and 1950s. This use has gradually faded out due to field safety concerns. It is part of the ceremonial dress uniform of many agencies, most notably the Red Serge worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. \n\nIn Australia, a white Sam Browne belt and strap is worn by the Victoria Police Mounted Unit, the New South Wales Police Force VIP Cyclists, Protocol Inspector and Protocol Sergeant (during ceremonies only), NSW Police Academy Senior Protocol Officer (Senior Sergeant) and Parade Sergeant  wear a black coloured leather basketweave Sam Browne belt and strap with silver coloured fittings as a badge of office. The same Sam Browne belt is also worn by the Australian Federal Police Ceremonial Mounted Cadre and AFP Drill Instructors.\n\nIn Italy a black Sam Browne belt with red trim is still worn by Carabinieri Warrant Officers (always when in service) and Officers (only at times); a white Sam Browne belt is also worn by Italian Police enlisted personnel.\n\nIn Ireland, a black Sam Browne belt is worn by Garda Síochána officers of the rank of Inspector and above when the tunic is worn.\n\nIn the United States, New Jersey State Police troopers wear a black Sam Browne belt in their distinctive uniform, which most other U.S. agencies generally reserve for dress uniforms.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Sam Browne belt has been proposed as a solution to occupational safety and health concerns about injury due to the weight of equipment on police officers' belts.   However, others have expressed concern that the vertical design of the belt could enable criminals to gain physical control of law enforcement officers in an altercation.  \n\nCivilian use\n\nDuring the interwar period, the belt became fashionable among some American  and European  women.  Eleanor Roosevelt, the first lady of the United States at the time, openly spoke out against the practice.   The belts also became a symbol of civilian authority by \"everybody from bus drivers to volunteer schoolboy traffic cops\".   The belt's use by junior safety patrol members became iconic.  \n\nSince the 1970s, the use of Sam Browne Belts has increased in popularity within the Queer BDSM Leather subculture. \n\nReflective Sam Browne belts are a popular safety device among cyclists for increasing their visibility, and a bright orange version is often worn by school crossing guards in junior safety patrols."

                "Carat: It's different for gold and diamonds\nCarat: It's different for gold and diamonds\nCommodity Online  | April     29, 2008 18:06 IST\nNot many people may know that carats do not mean the same for diamonds and gold. For gold, it is a measure of purity, on the other hand, in diamonds it's a weight measure.\nThe size of a diamond has the biggest impact on its price. The metric carat, which equals 0.20 gram, is the standard unit of weight for diamonds and most other gems.\nIf other factors are equal, the more a stone weighs, the more valuable it will be. Gemological laboratories measure carat weight when the diamond is loose (unmounted).\nIn today's world if the diamond is over one carat in size it will usually come with a certificate from the laboratory specifying the inclusions, color and size. The carat itself is made of one hundred particular parts called points.\nWhile it is possible to estimate the weight of a mounted diamond, the lab uses ultrasensitive scales to achieve an exact weight, measured 3 decimal places, although the third decimal place is not usually mentioned at the retail level.\nHere are several ways to express 1 carat: 1 ct.\n200 milligrams\n100 points\n4 grainer (not often used in retail environment)\nThat's why a 2 carat diamond is more than double the price of a 1 carat diamond.\nThe Beauty of round diamond\nThe best cut will display the diamond's brilliance to the best effect. When looking at a stone you need to look from the top down, this way you can see all of the facets and you need to check to see if you can see any inclusions in the diamond.\nTeardrop diamond is known as pear and the emerald cut is an octagonal shape which is oblong, the marquise diamond is an oval and it has points at the end. But, the pavilion can be cut with 4, 6, or 8 pavilion main facets. There are so many different types of cuts, there is the round, square, pear and cushion. When a diamond is cut it is cut for brilliance and to let the light reflect off of the facets.\nThere are many shapes of stones, but the one shape that is most sought after is the round diamond, it has the greatest reflective power and brilliance. The brilliance is determined by the ability of the diamond to reflect light.\nThe transparent white colorless diamond is most popular variety, but diamond also occurs in colors. When color is prominent it is called a fancy diamond. There are many different factors that will create color in a diamond. One of those factors is carbon spots in the diamond itself which will through off the color.\nAny diamond ring can make a good anniversary present. The solitaire is another ring that people like to give as an anniversary present. Most people notice the engagement ring and not the wedding band. That's why most women will want a nice round diamond of at least 1 carat in size. It is usually the engagement ring that is admired, not her wedding ring. And the setting of the diamond solitaire is there really just to hold the diamond.\nPlatinum is fast becoming the favorite choice in diamond settings and bands. When platinum is used for jewelry it is sometimes used for its strength and high shine and the ability to resist scratching. Platinum is geared toward a more modern look, whereas gold is traditionally beautiful.\nCarat for gold\nThe carat (abbreviation ct or Kt) is a measure of the purity of gold alloys. In the United States and Canada, the spelling karat is used, while the spelling carat is used to refer to the measure of mass for gemstones).\nTherefore 24-carat gold is fine (99.9 per cent Au w/w), 18-carat gold is 75 per cent gold, 12-carat gold is 50 per cent gold, and so forth.\nHistorically, in England the carat was divisible into four grains, and the grain was divisible into four quarts.\nFor example, a gold alloy of fineness (that is, 99.2 per cent purity) could have been described as being 23-carat, 3-grain, 1-quart gold.\nThe carat system is increasingly being complemented or superseded by the millesimal fineness system in which the purity of precious metals is denoted by parts per thousand of pure metal in the alloy.\nThe most common carats used for gold in bullion, jewellery making and by goldsmiths are:\n24 carat (millesimal fineness 999)\n22 carat (millesimal fineness 916)\n20 carat (millesimal fineness 833)\n18 carat (millesimal fineness 750)\n15 carat (millesimal fineness 625)\n14 carat (millesimal fineness 585)\n10 carat (millesimal fineness 417)\n9 carat (millesimal fineness 375)\nWeight of gold is usually denoted in sovereigns, grams and ounce or even kilogramme.\nPowered by",
                "etymology - Do \"carat\" and \"karat\" have the same origin? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange\nup vote 5 down vote accepted\nThere's essentially one word, with two meanings and two spellings. Wikipedia has articles at Carat (purity) and Carat (mass) . As a unit of mass, one carat (used for gemstones) is 200 milligrams, and as a measure of purity, n-carat gold (n≤24) is n/24 gold by weight. (12-carat gold is 50% gold, etc.) The spellings carat and karat are spelling variants of the same term. In America, a convention has been adopted to use the spelling carat for mass, and karat for purity. While this is a very fine convention to avoid confusion between the two meanings, does this make them two different words?\nEtymologically, the Online Etymology Dictionary says\ncarat\nmid-15c., from M.Fr. carat \"measure of the fineness of gold\" (14c.), from It. carato, from Arabic qirat \"pod, husk, weight of 4 grains,\" from Gk. keration \"carob seed,\" lit. \"little horn\" dim. of keras \"horn.\" Carob beans were a standard for weighing small quantities. As a measure of diamond weight, from 1570s. The Gk. measure was the equivalent of the Roman siliqua, which was one-twentyfourth of a golden solidus of Constantine; hence the word took on a sense of \"a proportion of one twentyfourth\" and became a measure of gold purity (1550s). Eighteen carat gold is eighteen parts gold, six parts alloy. It is unlikely that the classical carat was ever a measure of weight for gold.\nand\nkarat\nvariant of carat (q.v.). In U.S., karat is used for \"proportion of fine gold in an alloy\" and carat for \"weight of a precious stone.\"\nSo both the weight meaning and the 1/24th meaning come from Greco-Roman times (via Arabic, Italian, Middle French, in that order).\nThe Wikipedia sections Carat (purity)#Derivation and Carat (mass)#Etymology agree: once upon a time, carob seeds, because of their reputation for uniform weight, were used as measures of weight. This measure was roughly 1/24th of another unit, so the purity measure arose of it. There was no confusion because as weight, carat was probably never used for gold (and is today only used for diamonds, pearls, other gemstones).\nWiktionary defines:\nEtymology:\nCarat: Middle French carat, from Italian carato, from Arabic قيراط (qirāṭ, “husk”), from Ancient Greek κεράτιον (keration, “carob seed”), diminutive form of κέρας (keras, “horn”).\nKarat: From Middle English, from Middle French carat, from Medieval Latin carratus.\nSo I think they both have the same word origin, but I couldn't find a source to report the word origin is from Italy. ldoce lists the same origin for both. Is it Greek or Arabic?\nAccording to dehkhoda (the most reliable Persian dictionary) the word qirāṭ was borrowed by Greeks (keration) from Arabic and it's been reported by another book of that time (نقودالعربیه) the same way. It has been used long before in many parts of the Arab territories.\nThere are some Persian poems (and for sure some Arabic) using the original form of word, back in 1000 years ago.\nNote: ldoce defines karat an American Spelling of carat and makes no differences in meaning."

                "The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and streaming. To be eligible for the chart, a single is currently defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence.  The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in 2014. \n\nThe full chart is a Top 200 (previously a Top 250), though the OCC website contains the Top 100 only. Some media outlets only list the Top 40 (such as the BBC) or the Top 75 (such as Music Week magazine) of this list. Around 6,500 British retail outlets contribute sales data, as well as most UK online digital-download stores. Unlike charts in the United States, no airplay statistics are used for the official UK Singles Chart. The chart week runs from 00:01 Friday to midnight Thursday,  with most UK physical and digital singles being released on Fridays. From 3 August 1969 until 5 July 2015, the chart week ran from 00:01 Sunday to midnight Saturday. \n\nThe Top 40 chart is first issued on Friday afternoons by BBC Radio 1 as The Official Chart from 16:00 to 17:45, before the full Official Singles Chart Top 100 is posted on the Official Charts Company's website.  A rival chart show, The Vodafone Big Top 40, is based on downloads and commercial radio airplay and is broadcast Sunday afternoons from 16:00 to 19:00 across 140 local commercial radio stations around the United Kingdom. \n\nThe UK Singles Chart began to be compiled in 1952. According to the Official Charts Company's statistics, as of 1 July 2012, 1,200 singles have topped the UK Singles Chart.  The precise number of chart-toppers is debatable due to the profusion of competing charts from the 1950s to the 1980s, but the usual list used is that endorsed by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles and subsequently adopted by the Official Charts Company. The company regards a selected period of the New Musical Express chart (only from 1952 to 1960) and the Record Retailer chart from 1960 to 1969 as predecessors for the period prior to 11 February 1969, where multiples of competing charts (none official) coexisted side by side. For example, the BBC compiled its own chart based on an average of the music papers of the time; many songs announced as having reached number one on BBC Radio and Top of the Pops prior to 1969 are not listed as chart-toppers according to the legacy criteria of the Charts Company.\n\nHistory \n\nEarly charts \n\nBefore the compilation of sales of records, the music market measured a song's popularity by sales of sheet music. The idea of compiling a chart based on sales originated in the United States, where the music-trade paper Billboard compiled the first chart incorporating sales figures on 20 July 1940. Record charts in the UK began in 1952, when Percy Dickins of the New Musical Express (NME) gathered a pool of 52 stores willing to report sales figures.  For the first British chart Dickins telephoned approximately 20 shops, asking for a list of the 10 best-selling songs. These results were then aggregated into a Top 12 chart published in NME on 14 November 1952, with Al Martino's \"Here in My Heart\" awarded the number-one position. The chart became a successful feature of the periodical; it expanded into a Top 20 format on 1 October 1954, and rival publications began compiling their own charts in 1955. Record Mirror compiled its own Top 10 chart for 22 January 1955; it was based on postal returns from record stores (which were financed by the newspaper). The NME chart was based on a telephone poll.  Both charts expanded in size, with Mirrors becoming a Top 20 in October 1955 and NMEs becoming a Top 30 in April 1956.  Another rival publication, Melody Maker, began compiling its own chart; it telephoned 19 stores to produce a Top 20 for 7 April 1956. It was also the first chart to include Northern Ireland in its sample.\nRecord Mirror began running a Top 5 album chart in July 1956; from November 1958 onwards it was run by NME. In March 1960, Record Retailer began compiling an EP (album) chart and had a Top 50 singles chart. Although NME had the largest circulation of charts in the 1960s and was widely followed, in March 1962 Record Mirror stopped compiling its own chart and published Record Retailers instead. Retailer began independent auditing in January 1963, and has been used by the UK Singles Chart as the source for number-ones since the week ending 12 March 1960. The choice of Record Retailer as the source has been criticised; however, the chart was unique in listing close to 50 positions for the whole decade. With available lists of which record shops were sampled to compile the charts some shops were subjected to \"hyping\" but, with Record Retailer being less widely followed than some charts, it was subject to less hyping. Additionally, Retailer was set up by independent record shops and had no funding or affiliation with record companies. However, it had a significantly smaller sample size than some rival charts.\n\nBefore February 1969 (when the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) chart was established), there was no official chart or universally accepted source.  Readers followed the charts in various periodicals and, during this time, the BBC used aggregated results of charts from the NME, Melody Maker, Disc and (later) Record Mirror to compile the Pick of the Pops chart. The Official Charts Company and Guinness' British Hit Singles & Albums, use as sources for the unofficial period, the NME before 10 March 1960 and Record Retailer until 1969. \nHowever, until 1969 the Record Retailer chart was only seen by people working in the industry. The most widely circulated chart was the NME one, as used by Radio Luxembourg's legendary Sunday night Top 20 show, as well as by ABC TV's Thank Your Lucky Stars, which had an audience of up to 6 million on ITV.\n\nOfficial chart \n\nBefore 1969 there was no official singles chart. Record Retailer and the BBC commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to compile charts, beginning 15 February 1969. The BMRB compiled its first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops. The sampling cost approximately £52,000; shops were randomly chosen from a pool of approximately 6,000, and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. The sales diaries were translated into punch cards so the data could be interpreted by a computer. A computer then compiled the chart on Monday, and the BBC were informed of the Top 50 on Tuesday in time for it to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show. The charts were also published in Record Retailer (rebranded Record & Tape Retailer in 1971 and Music Week in 1972) and Record Mirror. However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The 1971 postal strike meant data had to be collected by telephone, but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart; by 1973, the BMRB was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures. In May 1978, the singles chart was expanded from a Top 50 to a Top 75. A World in Action documentary exposé in 1980 revealed corruption within the industry; stores' chart-returns dealers would frequently be offered bribes to falsify sales logs. \n\nElectronic-age charts \n\nFrom 1983 to 1990, the chart was financed by BPI (50 percent), Music Week (38 percent) and the BBC (12 percent). On 4 January 1983 the chart compilation was assumed by the Gallup Organization, which expanded the chart with a \"Next 25\" in addition to the Top 75 and began the introduction of computerised compilers, automating the data-collection process. In July 1987, Gallup signed a new agreement with BPI, increasing the sample size to approximately 500 stores and introducing barcode scanners to read data.  The chart was based entirely on sales of vinyl single records from retail outlets and announced on Tuesday until October 1987, when the Top 40 was revealed each Sunday (due to the new, automated process).\n\nThe 1980s also saw the introduction of the cassette single (or \"cassingle\") alongside the 7-inch and 12-inch record formats; in 1987, major record labels developed a common format for the compact disc single.  In May 1989, chart regulations kept Kylie Minogue's song \"Hand on Your Heart\" from entering at number one because sales from cassette singles were not included (they were sold for £1.99 – cheaper than allowed at the time). Following this, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) reduced the minimum price for cassette singles to influence sales figures.  In September 1989, W H Smith began to send sales data to Gallup directly through electronic point of sale (EPoS) terminals.\n\nIn January 1990, the BPI gave notice to Gallup, BBC and Music Week; on 30 June 1990, it terminated its contract with them because it \"could no longer afford the £600,000 a year cost\".   From 1 July 1990, the Chart Information Network (CIN) was formed by Spotlight Publications (publisher of Music Week), in cooperation with the BBC and the British Association of Record Dealers (BARD) – representing retailers, including W H Smith, Woolworths, HMV and Virgin – who agreed to exclusively supply sales data to the CIN.  A Chart Supervisory Committee (CSC) represented the BBC, CIN and retailers. The BPI were reluctant to join and \"consider[ed] the option of launching a rival chart\" but in September an agreement was reached, and it joined the CSC.  For this period, the chart was produced by Gallup and owned by CIN and Music Week (who would then sell it to the BBC and BPI).\n\nIn January 1991 the CIN became a joint venture between Link House Magazines (formerly Spotlight Publications, later Miller Freeman, Inc.)  and the BPI; they shared the revenue and costs (reportedly between £750,000 and £1 million).  During this time, other retailers (such as Woolworths and John Menzies) began submitting data using EpOS terminals. In late 1991 the sample consisted of 500 stores scanning barcodes of all record sales into an Epson PX-4 computer, and 650 other stores providing sales data through their own EPoS computerised tills. These computers were to be telephoned six times a week, providing the data to Gallup.  In June 1991, the BPI reduced the number of eligible formats from five to four.\n\nIn November 1990, the \"Next 25\" section of the UK singles chart (positions 76–100, with special rules) ceased to be printed in the trade magazine Music Week. In April 1991, Record Mirror ceased publication, along with the \"Next 25\".    Virgin installed JDA EPoS terminals in September 1993, and began providing sales data to Gallup. \n\nIn February 1993 the research contract for the chart was put out to tender, with a new four-year contract beginning 1 February 1994 offered. Millward Brown, Research International and Nielsen Market Research were approached, and Gallup were invited to re-apply.  In May, it was announced that Millward Brown had been accepted as the next chart compilers, signing a £1-million-a-year contract. Millward Brown took over compiling the charts on 1 February 1994, increasing the sample size; by the end of the month each shop sampled used a barcode scanner linking via an Epson terminal with a modem to a central computer (called \"Eric\"), which logged data from more than 2,500 stores.  Gallup attempted to block Millward Brown's new chart by complaining to the Office of Fair Trading about the contractual clause in which BARD retailers exclusively supplied sales data to the CIN, but the interim order was rejected.  In June 1995 the case was dropped, after the clause allowing BARD retailers to supply sales information to other chart compilers was deleted; because CIN retained the copyright, other compilers could not use (or sell) the information. \n\nOn 2 April 1995, the number of eligible formats was reduced from four to three.  The decision came after nine months of negotiations with BARD, which objected that it would adversely affect the vinyl record industry.  Although record labels were not prohibited from releasing singles in more than three formats, they were required to identify the three eligible formats. This resulted in a reduction in the number of singles released in 7-inch format; the most common three formats were 12-inch single, cassette and CD, or a cassette and two CD versions.  The ruling resulted in the Oasis single \"Some Might Say\" charting twice in one week – at number 1 with sales from the three eligible formats, and at number 71 from sales in a fourth (12-inch) format. \n\nSubsequently, CIN sought to develop new marketing opportunities and sponsorship deals; these included premium-rate fax and telephone services and the chart newsletters Charts+Plus (published from May 1991 to November 1994) and Hit Music (published from September 1992 to May 2001). Beginning in May 1991 Charts+Plus featured singles charts with positions 76–200 (plus artist albums positions 76–150, Top 50 compilations, and several genre and format charts). In September 1992, a second newsletter was created: Hit Music, a sister publication of Music Week featuring (among other charts) the singles Top 75 and a revived \"Next 25\". In November 1994, Charts+Plus ceased publication; Hit Music expanded its chart coverage to an uncompressed (without special rules) Top 200 Singles, Top 150 Artists Albums and Top 50 Compilations. In November 1996, the Artist Albums chart extended to a Top 200. Hit Music ceased publication in May 2001 with issue number 439. \n\nIn February 1997, CIN and BARD agreed to a new 18-month deal for the charts.  In 1998 the CSC agreed to new rules reducing the number of tracks on a single from four to three, playing time from 25 minutes to 20 and the compact disc single minimum dealer price to £1.79. \nOn 1 July 1998, BARD and BPI took over management of the chart from the CIN (a Miller Freeman and BPI venture) with new company Music Industry Chart Services (Mics);  however, in August they decided to return to compiling the charts under the name CIN. \n\nIn 1999, Millward Brown began \"re-chipping\" some retailers' machines, in anticipation of the millennium bug.  However, some independent retailers lost access to the record-label-funded Electronic Record Ordering System (Eros); it was \"too costly to make it Year 2000 compliant\".  Towards the end of the 1990s companies anticipated distributing singles over the Internet, following the example of Beggars Banquet and Liquid Audio (who made 2,000 tracks available for digital download in the US). \nIn November 2001, Chart Information Network (CIN) changed its name to \"The Official UK Charts Company\".\n\nBy September 2001, chart enthusiast Herman Verkade entered a licensing agreement with CIN and created an independent chart publication: ChartsPlus, covering the Top 75 Singles chart (and compressed positions 76–200), Top 200 artist albums chart, Top 50 compilations and other format and genre charts.\n\nInternet era \n\nIn January 2004, MyCokeMusic launched as the \"first significant download retailer\".Click or hover mouse on the picture of the laptop in January 2004 Legal downloading was initially small, with MyCokeMusic selling over 100,000 downloads during its first three months. In June the iTunes Store was launched in the UK, and more than 450,000 songs were downloaded during the first week.  In early September the UK Official Download Chart was launched, and a new live recording of Westlife's \"Flying Without Wings\" was the first number-one. \n\nIn 2005, Wes Butters presented the final UK Top 40, concluding his tenure at Radio 1. The chart show was then rebranded for the chart week ending 16 April, and the first singles chart combining physical-release sales with legal downloads began. Several test charts (and a download-sales chart) were published in 2004; this combination (within the official singles chart) reflected a changing era in which sales of actual singles fell and download sales rose. On 17 April 2005, hosts JK and Joel commented during their BBC Radio 1 broadcast that the incorporation of download sales resulted in an approximate doubling of singles sales for the week. For the first week's combined chart the impact of this doubling was not readily apparent at the top of the chart, although a few singles in the middle positions benefited.\n\nInitially, the British Association of Record Dealers was concerned that the popularity of downloading would siphon business from the High Street. It also complained that including singles not available physically would confuse customers and create gaps in stores' sale racks. However, it agreed to the new rules provided that digital sales were only included to a single's sales tally if there was a physical equivalent sold in shops at the time. Since there was no rule governing a minimum number of pressings, Gorillaz released only 300 vinyl copies of their single \"Feel Good Inc.\" on 12 April 2005 (a month before its general release). This allowed it to debut in the chart at number 22 (eventually reaching number 2), and remain in the Top 40 for a longer period.\n\nAfter pressure from elsewhere in the music industry a second compromise was reached in 2006, which now allowed singles to chart on downloads the week before their physical release. The first song to make the Top 40 on downloads alone was \"Pump It\" by The Black Eyed Peas, which charted at number 16 on 12 March 2006. Three weeks later, \"Crazy\" by Gnarls Barkley became the first song to top the charts on download sales alone. As part of the revised rules, singles would now be removed from the chart two weeks after the deletion of their physical formats; \"Crazy\" left the chart 11 weeks later from number 5 and a subsequent chart-topper, Nelly Furtado's \"Maneater\", disappeared from number 10. This was in addition to the existing rule that to be eligible for the chart, the physical single had to have been released within the last twelve months, supporting the general view that the chart reflects the top-selling \"current\" releases.\nOver the coming months digital sales continued to increase whilst physical sales continued to fall; more artists entered the top 40 early, and fewer singles entered the chart directly at number 1. Whilst initially the proportion of digital sales to physical sales in the combined tally was relatively low, a majority of singles as of 2012 see more than 50 percent of their sales coming from online. Sales through mobile phones are also counted.\n\nOn 1 January 2007 the integration of downloaded music into the charts became complete when all downloads – with or without a physical equivalent – became eligible to chart, bringing an end to the UK singles chart by turning it into a \"songs\" chart. This saw a few singles gain publicity: \"Crazy\" and \"Maneater\" (still selling strongly on downloads some time after their physical equivalents had been withdrawn) returned to the chart with several others which had been removed in the preceding months. \"Chasing Cars\" by Snow Patrol returned at a Top 10 position (number 9, just three places below the peak it had reached the previous September), while \"Honey to the Bee\" by Billie Piper (following a tongue-in-cheek promotional push by Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles to test the new chart rules) reappeared at number 17 (nearly eight years after its original appearance on the charts).\n\nThe second song to return to the Top 40 several years after its first hit run was \"I'll Be Missing You\" by Puff Daddy and Faith Evans, which reappeared at number 32 a decade after it originally topped the chart. The impetus this time was Puff Daddy's recent performance of a new version of the track at the Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium. Two months later Luciano Pavarotti's \"Nessun Dorma\" returned to the chart at number 24 during the week following his death (17 years after it was first a hit), climbing to number 12. A drumming gorilla in a Dairy Milk television advertisement helped \"In the Air Tonight\" by Phil Collins to climb to number 14, 26 years after it was first a hit and 19 years since its last chart appearance as a remix. None of these songs had been officially re-issued.\n\n\"Blag, Steal and Borrow\" by Koopa became the first song to chart without being released physically (and the first by an unsigned band to do so). Later they would do it again twice, with \"One Off Song for the Summer\" and \"The Crash\" reaching No. 21 and No. 16 respectively (while the band remained unsigned until the following year).\n\nFollowing the cancellation of its physical release, \"Say It Right\" by Nelly Furtado was the first Top 10 hit to pass through its chart career without a single copy appearing in a shop. \"Lord Don't Slow Me Down\" by Oasis became the second, \"Violet Hill\" by Coldplay the third, and \"Disturbia\" by Rihanna the fourth; \"Candyman\" by Christina Aguilera had a chart run that took it into the Top 20 (number 17) entirely on downloads.\n\nThe first number-one hit never released physically was Run by Leona Lewis, the 11th song in total to reach number one on downloads alone. Unlike the previous 10, it did not receive a physical release in subsequent weeks (although it was released physically overseas, notably in Germany).\n\nThe second occurrence was on 20 December 2009, when \"Killing in the Name\" by Rage Against the Machine became the first song that was not a new release to reach No. 1 on downloads alone. This was the result of a Facebook campaign urging people to download the song in a bid to prevent The X Factor winning song from becoming the Christmas No. 1 single again after four consecutive years. The song originally peaked at No. 25 in 1992.\n\nNew rules were added to the chart on 16 September 2007 to include one-track CD singles (with a limit of 15 minutes) and to retail at a minimum of 40p per one-track CD single.\n\nA notable effect of the new chart rules is to demonstrate the enduring appeal of many downloads, especially if a physical copy is no longer (or never has been) available. Despite a seven-week gap in its chart run in late 2006 while ineligible under the old rules, Snow Patrol's \"Chasing Cars\" clocked 108 weeks on the chart, a record bettered by only one single in chart history (\"My Way\" by Frank Sinatra with 124 weeks). Numerous other hits are on for more than 40 weeks.\n\nJeff Buckley's 1994 cover of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" charted at number 2 on 21 December 2008 on downloads alone, following the formation of a 110,000-strong protest group on Facebook to get it above (winner of The X Factor 2008) Alexandra Burke's version for the Christmas number one.\n\nAnother consequence of the chart rules (that was expected but has not materialised) is that in the event of a new album release by a well-known artist, all (or most) of its tracks could appear on the singles chart due to buyers downloading individual songs rather than the complete album. There was no significant example of this until early October 2007, with the cast of High School Musical 2 placing six of its songs in the Top 75 (although these were credited to their individual performers) and a further four just outside. A month later, Leona Lewis placed five tracks from her album Spirit simultaneously on the singles chart. Another example was anticipated with the arrival of The Beatles' catalogue online, with forecasters predicting the entire top 10 being taken up by Beatles songs.   This chart domination never occurred; only four Beatles songs re-entered the Top 75, the highest-placed being \"Let It Be\" at number 38.\n\nYet another effect of the new rules was the reappearance in the chart of a number of seasonal favourites during Christmas 2007. A total of 19 achieved this without being officially re-issued (on downloads alone). Two of these (by Mariah Carey and The Pogues), reached the Top 5. Eleven Christmas hits returned to the Top 75 for Christmas 2008, nine in 2009, eight in 2010 and twelve in 2011, with the Mariah Carey and Pogues songs faring best each year.\n\nThe first unsigned artist to break the top 5 was Alex Day, who reached number 4 with his single \"Forever Yours\" in the Christmas chart, beating Coldplay and Olly Murs,  following a large-scale social media campaign. In February 2013, unsigned artists Macklemore and Ryan Lewis topped the chart with \"Thrift Shop\". \n\nThe death of Michael Jackson on 25 June 2009 triggered a surge in sales of his recordings; this was the first time in the download era that the effect of a major star's death on the chart could be observed. During the week beginning 28 June, a total of 16 of his solo hits (plus 4 more by The Jackson 5) re-entered the chart. The following week, the momentum continued; 27 Jackson titles charted in the Top 75 (21 solo, one with his sister Janet and five by the Jacksons) with \"Man in the Mirror\" charting the highest, at number 2. The second chart invasion of the download era resulting from the death of a major artist was observed in late July 2011 following the death of Amy Winehouse, with seven former singles charting and one other song appearing for the first time.\n\nIt was announced in June 2014 that as of Sunday, 29 June, audio streams from services such as Spotify, Deezer, Napster, O2 Tracks, Xbox Music, Sony Unlimited and rara would be counted towards the Official Singles Chart, in order to reflect changing music consumption in the United Kingdom.  The final number one on the UK Singles Chart to be based on sales alone was \"Gecko (Overdrive)\" by Oliver Heldens featuring Becky Hill.  On Sunday 6 July 2014, the Official Charts Company announced that Ariana Grande had earned a place in UK chart history when her single \"Problem\", featuring Iggy Azalea becoming the first number-one single based on sales and streaming data. \n\nOn 7 December 2014, Ed Sheeran's \"Thinking Out Loud\" became the first single to reach number one as a direct result of streaming inclusion. Despite Union J's \"You Got It All\" topping the Sales Chart that week, \"Thinking Out Loud\" was streamed 1.6 million times in the same week, resulting in an overall lead of 13,000 chart sales. \n\nComparison of singles charts (1952–1969)\n\nWith no official chart before 1969, a number of periodicals compiled their own charts during the 1950s and 1960s. The five main charts (as used by BBC's Pick of the Pops) were:\n\n*New Musical Express (NME) (1952–1988): The first singles chart, a major source until March 1960, widely followed throughout the 1960s\n*Record Mirror (1955–1962): The second singles chart; compiled the first album chart, published Record Retailer chart from 1962. The Pick of the Pops average stopped using Record Mirror after 21 May 1960, due to the paper changing its weekly publication day\n*Melody Maker (1956–1988): The third singles chart, major source for album charts from 1958 onwards\n*Disc (1958–1967): The fourth singles chart\n*Record Retailer (1960–1969): The fifth singles chart; a trade paper, regarded as a major source from its inception; jointly formed BMRB chart in 1969. Not included in the Pick of the Pops average until 31 March 1962.\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nThe full regulations may be downloaded from the Official Charts Company website (see \"External links\", below).\n\nTo qualify for inclusion in the UK singles chart, a single must be available in one or more of the following eligible formats: \n*Digital audio download music track of up to 15 minutes\n*Digital audio stream music track of up to 15 minutes\n*Digital single bundle of up to four tracks with a maximum of 25 minutes playing time\n*CD with up to two tracks\n*CD, DVD or other digital memory device with up to four tracks with a maximum of 25 minutes playing time\n*7 inch vinyl with up to three tracks or 12 inch vinyl with up to four tracks, and up to 25 minutes playing time\n*One song and any number of remixes up to a maximum playing time of 40 minutes\n\nThere are minimum sales prices for all formats apart from on demand digital streams which may be from subscription or advertising funded providers and are counted at 100 streams equivalent to one paid download or physical sale.\n\nChart broadcasts\n\nThe BBC aired Pick of the Pops on its Light Programme radio station on 4 October 1955. Initially airing popular songs, it developed an aggregated chart in March 1958. Using the NME, Melody Maker, Disc and Record Mirror charts, the BBC averaged them by totalling points gained on the four charts (one point for a number one, two for a number two, etc.) to give a chart average; however, this method was prone to tied positions. Record Retailer was included in the average on 31 March 1962, after Record Mirror ceased compiling its chart. David Jacobs and Alan Freeman both had stints presenting the Pick of the Pops chart.  Freeman took Pick of the Pops to its regular Sunday afternoon slot in early 1962.  Freeman (along with Pete Murray, David Jacobs and Jimmy Savile) was one of the four original presenters on Top of the Pops, which first aired 1 January 1964 on BBC One (then known as BBC TV).  Top of the Pops, like Pick of the Pops, used a combination of predominant periodicals until the formation of the BMRB chart in 1969.\n\nFrom 30 September 1967 BBC Radio 1 was launched along with BBC Radio 2, succeeding the Light Programme,  and the Top-20 Pick of the Pops chart was simulcast on both stations.  Freeman continued to present the show until 1972, and was succeeded by Tom Browne.  Simon Bates took over from Browne, and under Bates it became a Top-40 show in 1978.  Bates was succeeded by Tony Blackburn, who presented the show for two-and-a-half years; Tommy Vance, who presented for two years, Bates returned in January 1984 and presented the show until September that year, then Richard Skinner for eighteen months.   Bruno Brookes took over in 1986 and, in October 1987, automated data collection allowed the countdown to be announced on the Sunday chart show (instead of on Tuesdays).\n\nIn 1990, Brookes was replaced as presenter by Mark Goodier, but returned 18 months later. Goodier took over from Brookes once more in 1995 and continued presenting the show until 2002.  In February 2003 Wes Butters hosted the chart show; two years later his contract was not renewed, and he was replaced by JK and Joel.  The duo were made redundant by Radio 1 in September 2007; Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates replaced them at the helm of the chart show.  Cotton left in September 2009, and until 2012 the chart show was hosted by Yates.  Yates left Radio 1 at the end of 2012, because he wanted to spend more time with his family, as well as focusing more on television. Jameela Jamil took over from him in January 2013, becoming the first woman to host, alone, the BBC Chart show  before being replaced by Clara Amfo. On 10 July 2015, Greg James took over from Amfo, who had become the show's shortest-serving principal presenter.\n\nMidweek chart updates\n\nFrom March 2010 Greg James hosted a half-hour show at 3:30 pm on Wednesdays, announcing a chart update based on midweek sales figures previously only available to the industry. The chairman of the Official Charts Company said it would provide \"insight into how the race for number one is shaping up\".  Scott Mills became the host of the Chart Update from April 2012, due to schedule changes which saw Mills host what was Greg's early afternoon show.   When the chart moved to Fridays in July 2015, the chart update moved to 5:30 pm on Mondays.  The show is once again hosted by Greg James and the top ten songs are quickly overviewed with the top three being played in full before Newsbeat at 5:45.\n\nSponsorship\n\nIn 1999, the chart was sponsored by worldpop.com with the company receiving name recognition during the BBC programme. However, the deal ended when the website went out of business in late 2001. As part of an agreement with Billboard to publish the UK chart in section of their magazine, Billboard required the chart to have a sponsor. In 2003, it was announced that Coca-Cola had signed a two-year contract with the Official Charts Company beginning 1 January 2004. Although the amount was not publicly disclosed, it was believed to be between £1.5 million and £2 million. Since advertising on the BBC is prohibited under the BBC Charter and the government was attempting to reduce childhood obesity, the decision was widely criticised. Coca-Cola was restricted to two on-air mentions during the chart show, with the BBC justifying the deal by saying it did not negotiate or benefit financially.  A few days into the contract, the BBC agreed to drop on-air mentions of the brand. \n\nRecords and statistics\n\nMost number-one singles\n\nThe artists credited as a named artist on the most UK number-one singles are: \n* 21 – Elvis Presley\n* 17 – The Beatles including 1 as The Beatles with Billy Preston\n* 14 – Cliff Richard including 1 with The Drifters, 6 with The Shadows and 1 with The Young Ones\n* 14 – Westlife including 1 with Mariah Carey\n* 13 – Madonna including 1 featuring Justin Timberlake and Timbaland\n* 12 – The Shadows including 7 with Cliff Richard (1 as The Drifters)\n* 12 – Take That including 1 featuring Lulu\n\nMost weeks at number one\n\nThe songs which spent the most weeks at number 1 are: \n\n* 18 – \"I Believe\" by Frankie Laine*\n* 16 – \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\" by Bryan Adams\n* 15 – \"Love Is All Around\" by Wet Wet Wet\n* 15 – \"One Dance\" by Drake featuring Wizkid and Kyla\n* 14 – \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen*\n* 11 – \"Rose Marie\" by Slim Whitman\n* 10 – \"Cara Mia\" by David Whitfield\n* 10 – \"I Will Always Love You\" by Whitney Houston\n* 10 – \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna featuring Jay Z\nNote: Songs denoted with an asterisk (*) spent non-consecutive weeks at number one\n\nBest-selling singles",
                "For the online collaborative production company, see hitRECord\nA hit record is an audio recording, usually in the form of a single or album, that sells a large number of copies or otherwise becomes broadly popular or well-known, through airplay, club play, inclusion in a film or stage play soundtrack, causing it to have \"hit\" (appeared on) one of the popular chart listings. Despite the current dominance of a few record companies worldwide, for reasons of cultural, political, and linguistic differences, few songs achieve broad international airplay and sales. Most hits are only so in the country of their release, or at most, in countries sharing a language, like English, Portuguese, or Modern Standard Arabic, and to a lesser extent, French and Spanish.

                "Hunting High and Low is the debut studio album by Norwegian new wave band A-ha. Released on 1 June 1985 by Warner Bros. Records, the album was a huge commercial success selling more than 7.8 million units worldwide,  peaking at number 15 on the US Billboard 200 and reaching high positions on charts worldwide. The album was recorded at Eel Pie Studios in Twickenham, produced by Tony Mansfield, John Ratcliff and Alan Tarney.\n\nIn all, five singles from the album were released, though not all were released internationally: \"Take On Me\", \"Love Is Reason\", \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\", \"Train of Thought\" and \"Hunting High and Low\". The group was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards in 1986, making A-ha the first Norwegian band to be nominated for a Grammy.\n\nAs part of a re-release of their first two albums, Hunting High and Low was expanded and remastered in 2010.\n\nMusic\n\n\"Take On Me\" was the first single released by the band. An early version was recorded and released in late 1984 with an early music video. The song became a #3 hit in A-ha's native Norway but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. The band went back into the studio to re-record the song for the Hunting High and Low album, but a second UK release in early 1985 was again ignored. Before releasing their single in the United States, the band undertook the production of a new music video for the song, working with director Steve Barron. Barron had previously created hit videos for Toto, Thomas Dolby, Culture Club and Michael Jackson, but the A-ha video was unlike any of his earlier work. A plot-driven amalgamation of live-action and rotoscope-style animation by husband-and-wife team Michael Patterson and Candace Reckinger, it drew inspiration from Patterson's animated film Commuter and the film Altered States. The innovative video for \"Take On Me\" was first broadcast on local Boston music video station V-66, and soon after given heavy rotation on MTV.\n\nThe single debuted in Billboard the week of 13 July 1985, and was heading into the U.S. top twenty when it was given an international release, including a second release in Norway and a third shot at the UK market. It hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, spending 27 weeks on the charts and becoming the tenth-biggest single of 1985,  and this time going to number two in the United Kingdom and number one in Norway. In all, the song reached number one in 36 countries, becoming one of the world's best-selling singles of all time with nearly 9 million copies sold.\n\nThe second single for most of the world was \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" (\"Love is Reason\" had failed to hit the Norwegian Top 40 earlier in the year), and the band followed its massively successful music video with another critically acclaimed clip for the song. Starting off as a sequel of sorts, Harket breaks away from his happy ending to join his band in performance amidst mannequins at a rural church, Saint Albans in Teddington, which has since become an art gallery. \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" improved upon the first single's success in the United Kingdom, hitting number one and remaining there for two weeks in January 1986.  It was a top-10 hit nearly everywhere it was released except in the United States, where it peaked at #20 and would be the band's last major hit to date in that country. The single sold 5 million copies around the world. The track was remixed as a dance version, which was a top-5 hit on the U.S. Dance chart, and B-side to the single and remix was the otherwise unreleased \"Driftwood.\"\n\n\"Train of Thought\" saw limited release as the third single in Europe. It was not released as a 7\" in the United States but received rock radio play and a set of remixes again made the dance charts. Waaktaar based the lyrics for this song on existentialist authors and poets Gunvor Hofmo, Knut Hamsun and Fyodor Dostoevsky, his favourites at the time. It was A-ha's third consecutive Top 10 single in the United Kingdom and Ireland, reaching #8 and #5 respectively, and charting well in Germany and Sweden. World sales hit 500,000 copies.\n\nThe last single from the album was \"Hunting High and Low\", released in June 1986. The single saw its highest chartings in France, where it peaked at number four,  and the United Kingdom, where it was number five.  The single was released in the United States but did not make the Hot 100. An extended version was available on 12\" vinyl, but the midtempo track did not see dance chart success.\n\nColdplay, a band influenced by A-ha, has been known to perform \"Hunting High and Low\" in concert.\n\nThe \"Take On Me\" video was nominated for eight 1986 MTV Video Music Awards, and at the third annual ceremony 5 September 1986, the video won six awards, including Best New Artist and Viewer's Choice.  \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" was nominated for an additional three awards, winning two, for a total of eight wins. Even as the total number of categories has nearly doubled, only one other artist to date has won as many MTV Awards in a single year. Peter Gabriel won nine the following year for \"Sledgehammer\" and \"Big Time,\" two videos which progressed further down the roads A-ha ventured in groundbreaking use of animation in music video.\n\nIn 2002, \"Take On Me\" was ranked at number eight on VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders, although this status is slightly misleading as it reflects A-ha's lack of mainstream success in the United States; the group was by no means a one-hit wonder elsewhere or in career terms. In 2006, \"Take On Me\"  was ranked number 24 on VH1's Greatest Songs of the 1980s. \n\nThe cover photograph was taken by Just Loomis and was nominated in 1986 for a Grammy as \"Album Cover of the Year.\"\n\nThe band released a live version of \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" in 2003.\n\nRelease and reception\n\nHunting High and Low was a-ha's breakout album. Upon its release in May 1985, Hunting High and Low peaked at number 15 on the Billboards Top 200 album chart. The album granted A-ha international recognition. Hunting High and Low got 3x platinum status in the UK and Platinum status in the United States and Germany, and Gold status in Brazil, and the Netherlands.The album reached #11 in the European top-100 albums sales chart.\n\nThe album peaked at 15 in the U.S., according to Billboard music charts and has sold about 1.8 million copies in the U.S. It peaked at 2 on the UK charts (re-enter at number 83 in 2015), and hit 1 in Norway. The album has been certified platinum in the United States and 3x platinum in UK.  On the Billboard 200, Hunting High and Low held the record for the highest-charting album by a Norwegian artist until Do It Again by Norwegian duo Röyksopp and Swedish singer Robyn (which peaked at number 14). \n\nBeginning with the single \"Take On Me\", A-ha's debut album sold more than eight million copies worldwide and spawned two number one hits. In the fall of 1986, \"Take On Me\" and \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" were nominated for 11 MTV Video Awards combined, and A-ha won eight of these. \n\nTim DiGravina of AllMusic Guide said \"It's a cohesive album with smart pace changeups, and it rarely fails to delight or satisfy a listener's need for a synth pop fix... One can't escape the feeling that Hunting High and Low is a product of the 1980s, but with highs like 'Take On Me' and 'The Sun Always Shines on TV,' and no lows in sight, A-ha's debut is a treat worth relishing.\"\n\nThe album has sold more than ten million copies worldwide. \n\nHunting High and Low Tour\n\nIn June 1986, A-ha began a world tour which went through to February 1987. The band had never played a single concert when \"Take On Me\" shot to #1 in America; soon it could boast a 16-country, 113-city tour under its belt along with countless interviews and television appearances.\n\nRemaster\n\nOn 6 May 2010, the band announced the remaster and re-release of the album. The two disc album will comprise the original album and four 12\" tracks on one disc, while the second will feature 19 rare demos and unreleased songs from this era.\n\nOn 6 July 2010 the albums Hunting High and Low and Scoundrel Days were released as deluxe editions in the United States through Rhino Records and both albums debuted in the Top 40 on the Billboard Top Internet Sales Chart; Hunting High and Low at #34 and Scoundrel Days at #36. \n\nHunting High and Low (remaster) charts: #39 Germany, #32 Norway, #27 Hungary, #165 UK\n\nScoundrel Days (remaster) charts: #52 Germany, #27 Norway, #190 UK\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll lyrics written by Pål Waaktaar; all music composed by Waaktaar except where noted.\n\n#\"Take On Me\" – 3:48 (Waaktaar/Furuholmen/Harket)\n#\"Train of Thought\" – 4:14\n#\"Hunting High and Low\" – 3:45\n#\"The Blue Sky\" – 2:36\n#\"Living a Boy's Adventure Tale\" – 5:00 (Waaktaar/Harket)\n#\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" – 5:08\n#\"And You Tell Me\" – 1:51\n#\"Love Is Reason\" – 3:04 (Waaktaar/Furuholmen)\n#\"I Dream Myself Alive\" – 3:06 (Waaktaar/Furuholmen)\n#\"Here I Stand and Face the Rain\" – 4:30\n\n2010 deluxe edition\n\n;Disc 1 bonus tracks  \n#\"Take On Me\" – 3:48 (Waaktaar/Furuholmen/Harket)\n#\"Train of Thought\" – 4:14\n#\"Hunting High and Low\" – 3:45\n#\"The Blue Sky\" – 2:36\n#\"Living a Boy's Adventure Tale\" – 5:00 (Waaktaar/Harket)\n#\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" – 5:08\n#\"And You Tell Me\" – 1:51\n#\"Love Is Reason\" – 3:04 (Waaktaar/Furuholmen)\n#\"I Dream Myself Alive\" – 3:06 (Waaktaar/Furuholmen)\n#\"Here I Stand and Face the Rain\" – 4:30\n# \"Take On Me\" (Original 1984 7\" Version)\n# \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" (Extended Mix)\n# \"Train of Thought\" (U.S. Mix)\n# \"Hunting High and Low\" (Extended Remix)\n\n;Disc 2\n#\"Take On Me\" (demo)\n#\"Train of Thought\" (demo)\n#\"Hunting High and Low\" (demo)\n#\"The Blue Sky\" (demo)\n#\"Living a Boy's Adventure Tale\" (early version)\n#\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" (demo)\n#\"And You Tell Me\" (demo)\n#\"Love Is Reason\" (demo)\n#\"I Dream Myself Alive\" (demo)\n#\"Here I Stand and Face the Rain\" (demo)\n#\"Stop!

                "The Curry House - Glossary of Indian Restaurant Curries\nGlossary of Indian Restaurant Curries\n \n \nbalti\nBalti is more a style of cooking than one particular curry. The word balti can be translated as \"bucket\" (i.e. a cooking pan) and some say the style of cooking is indigenous to an area of northern Pakistan known as Baltistan. A balti pan is basically a karahi which has the shape of a Chinese wok but with 2 small round handles on either side of the pan instead of one long handle. In specialist \"Balti Houses\" the balti is a meal in itself which contains both meat and vegetables and is eaten straight from the karahi using curled up pieces of nan bread. In standard Indian restaurants the balti is more of a stir-fried curry containing plenty of fried green peppers and fresh coriander (\ncilantro). Medium hot.\nbhuna\nBhuna is first and foremost a cooking process where spices are gently fried in plenty of oil to bring out their flavour. The dish \"bhuna\" is an extension of that process where meat is added to the spices and then cooked in its own juices which results in deep strong flavours but very little sauce. The restaurant bhuna is a well spiced curry with a thick sauce.  It is often garnished with fried green peppers (\nbell peppers) and shredded onions. Usually medium hot although I have had some pretty hot ones in my time.\nbiryani\nBiryani is not a curry at all but the curry connection comes from the mixed vegetable curry with which it is served in most Indian restaurants.\nBiryani originated in Persia and, at its simplest, was rice and meat baked together in the oven. The cooks to the Moghul emperors took the biryani and transformed it into a courtly delicacy by adding aromatic spices and other exotic ingredients. Traditionally, biryanis are baked in the oven for some time so the aromatic spices and juices from the meat permeate the rice. In the Indian restaurant, however, all the dishes are made to order and the poor chef has to find a way of preparing the biryani in double quick time.  So the restaurant biryani is often just pilau rice stir fried with chicken or lamb which has been cooked as an extra dry bhuna. The restaurant biryani is usually garnished with almonds and sultanas (\ngolden raisins) and is accompanied by a mixed vegetable curry to add a little juiciness to the rice. Mild.\ndhansak\nA famous Parsee dish. Interestingly the dhan part of the name means rice and a dhansak is traditionally served with a pulao of fried and spiced rice. An authentic dhansak will made with lamb and contain vegetables and many different types of dhal (the sak in the name). The curry house dhansak is often referred to as \"hot, sweet and sour with lentils\". The \"hot\" is chilli powder, the \"sweet\" is sugar and the \"sour\" is lemon juice. Curry houses commonly use masoor dhal (split red lentils) but some restaurants now use chana dhal to good effect. If it is done well the dhansak is an excellent curry with contrasting flavours and textures. But if the \"sweet\" in your restaurant dhansak is provided by the addition of pineapple then, in my opinion, you should order something else.\ndopiaza\nThe dopiaza is a classic Indian dish dating back at least to Moghul times. The name dopiaza broadly translates as \"2  onions\" or \"double onions\". Some traditional versions of the dopiaza use twice the weight of onions compared to the weight of meat but a classic Indian dopiaza is more likely to use the onions in 2 different ways, fried and boiled, at different stages of the cooking. The restaurant version has small fried pieces of onion in the sauce and then larger chunks of lightly cooked onion are added towards the end of the cooking. Medium hot.\njalfrezi\nJalfrezi is not a traditional Indian dish as such but, like the bhuna, is actually a method of cooking. It literally means \"hot-fry\" but is probably better translated as \"stir-fry\". The term jalfrezi entered the English language at the time of the British Raj in India. Colonial households employed Indian cooks who would use the jalfrezi method of cooking to heat up cold roasted meat and potatoes. But the restaurant jalfrezi is not a version of the Anglo-Indian dish. Oh no. The Indian restaurant chef uses the jalfrezi method to stir-fry green peppers, onions and plenty of green chillies as the basis for a curry with just a little sauce. The chillies make the jalfrezi taste very fresh but also make it one of the hotter curries on the restaurant menu.\nkorai\nMany Indian restaurants had a balti-style curry on their menu long before the rise in popularity of balti cooking in the UK. They did not call the curry a balti but rather a korai or karahi and many restaurants still carry one on their menu. Both the balti and korai contain stir fried meat and vegetables and both take their name from the utensil in which they are cooked. Because korai is a style of cooking rather than a traditional recipe the curry house versions can vary considerably from restaurant to restaurant. It can be medium or hot and will usually contain green peppers, tomatoes and onions.\nkorma\nA traditional korma will have a long slow cooking. In fact, korma is not one particular dish but rather a method of cooking similar to braising. Because korma is a cooking method there are a wide variety of dishes that could be described as \"korma\". Many kormas call for the meat to be marinated in yoghurt and then the meat plus marinade are braised on a very low heat until all the juices condense down into a thick sauce. The restaurant chef has to cook to order so doesn't have time for long, slow cooking. The korma you find in Indian restaurants usually contains ground almonds, coconut and thick cream. It is often described on restaurant menus as being \"very mild\" but a good korma should not be bland.\nMadras\nThe curry house Madras is a restaurant invention which started life as simply a hotted up version of the standard restaurant curry. Because it is a restaurant invention rather than a traditional recipe the Madras can vary considerably from one restaurant to another. The restaurant Madras can be hot or very hot, red or brown, a hotter version of a plain curry or quite rich in tomatoes. Mostly though it comes with plenty of sauce and is strongly spiced . It is the standard restaurant hot curry.\nMoghul masala\nThe Moghul dynasty ruled much of the Asian sub-continent for 3 centuries and left behind a fabulous legacy not just in art and architecture but also in sumptuous cuisine. There is no one Moghul style but the usual restaurant interpretation is rich and creamy. The curry house Moghul masala contains plenty of ginger, ground almonds, yoghurt and cream. Some restaurants offer a Shahi Moghul dish which is garnished with a small omelette flavoured with chopped coriander leaves. Mild to medium.\npasanda\nDerived from a court dish of the Moghul emperors the pasanda is traditionally made with thinly sliced and marinated lamb fillets. It is sometimes called lamb badam pasanda because the dish contains ground almonds, the \"badam\" of the title. The restaurant pasanda is usually quite mild and contains ground almonds, cardamon pods, purÃ©ed tomatoes and cream.\npatia\nLike it's more famous cousin, dhansak, patia is a Parsee dish. A traditional Parsee patia is made with fish cooked in a dark vinegar sauce. The restaurant patia is hot, sweet and sour in equal measure. The restaurant patia grew popular as a starter using prawns (\nshrimps) as the main ingredient. Many restaurants now offer the patia as a main course as well and give you the choice of a prawn, chicken or lamb version. It is usually garnished with fried tomato pieces.\nrogan josh\nRogan josh is another all time favourite on the curry house menu. It was originally a Kashmiri dish but is equally at home in the Punjab. An authentic rogan josh will be made with lamb and may, at its most elaborate, contain dozens of spices. The Kashmiri and Punjabi versions do differ (the Kashmiri does not traditionally contain onions or garlic) but they are both highly spiced and share a deep red colour derived from the liberal use of dried red Kashmiri chillies. The curry house rogan is also red but the colour comes from red peppers and tomatoes rather than Kashmiri chillies. The restaurant rogan is characterised by its garnish of tomato pieces and fresh coriander. It is usually medium hot.\nsaag\nSaag gosht is a classic curry traditionally made with spinach and lamb. Saag is, strictly speaking, a general term for tender green leaves such as spinach, mustard greens and fresh fenugreek leaves. If you were talking about spinach on its own it would be called palak.  Many restaurants these days will offer a chicken or a prawn alternative to lamb and so the dish will show on the menu as just \"saag\" or \"palak\" omitting the gosht (lamb) from the name altogether. The saag is usually served medium hot and is made in the bhuna style.\ntikka masala\nTo my mind it is fruitless to enter the debate on the origins of the famous chicken tikka masala. If you want to remind yourself of the contending arguments then take a look at the essay on the subject \"Is it or isn't it? - the chicken tikka masala story\" by food historians Peter and Colleen Grove. Chicken tikka masala is the all time most popular dish on the Indian restaurant menu and what the restaurant diner really needs to know is whether the restaurant is providing a good example of the dish. And what is a good example? Well, the chicken tikka pieces should be aromatic and slightly smoky from the tandoor. The masala sauce should be well spiced but not hot, rich and creamy and have a hint of coconut.  Tikka masala usually has a deep red colour, gained from the use of artificial food colourings.\nvindaloo\nThe vindaloo was originally a Portuguese dish which took its name from the 2 main ingredients which were \"vinho\", wine/wine vinegar, and \"alhos\", garlic. Over time it was spiced up, hotted up and otherwise changed by the indigenous peoples of the ex-Portuguese colony of Goa. Not many restaurants produce an authentic Goan vindaloo not least because the pork used by Christian Goans in their recipe would not be acceptable to Muslim chefs. In some restaurants the vindaloo is just a pumped-up Madras i.e. the same recipe but with lots more chilli powder. Other restaurants have interpreted the \"aloo\" part of the name as meaning potato and introduced diced potato to a hot standard curry with added lemon juice for tartness and black pepper for extra pungency. Very hot.",
                "Goan Cuisine: 10 Dishes that Scream GOA!\n \nGoan Cuisine: 10 Dishes that Scream GOA!\nThe small Western State of Goa in India is ever famous for three things…the beaches, it’s easy-going nature and it’s FOOD..Goan Cuisine. The men of Goa with their pot bellies are evidence of the fact that Goans love their Food.\nThe Goan cuisine is an interesting mix of varied influences. The long period of Portuguese rule, besides that of the Muslim and Hindu kingdoms, has left an indelible influence on the original style of Goan cooking and this has led to an exotic mix of truly tasty and spicy cuisine. Most people who sample Goan cuisine, enjoy this different and unique style of food which has a distinct and unique combination of spicy flavours.\nWith over a hundred kilometers of coastline it’s no shocker that fish and seafood are staples here. A Goan meal is incomplete without Fish, Rice and Curry cooked with coconut. Apart from fish though Pork is Widely available and eaten mainly among the Christians. Beef is commonly available as well unlike the rest of India. Though there are some vegetarian dishes they are not widely known or associated with Goa. Goa really caters for non-vegetarian meat lovers.\nHere are the 10 Most Popular Dishes of Goa\n– Seafood\nGoa is famous for its seafood, the ‘classic’ dish being Goan fish curry and rice. Apart from a Curry preparation fish is also fried and sometimes picked. Kingfish is probably the most common item, on the menu, but pomfret, doumer, shark, tuna and mackerel are hot favourites as well. Among the excellent shellfish available are crabs, prawns, tiger prawns and lobster. Other seafood includes squid and mussels. Goa’s luscious coconut and fish based dishes draw in people from all over the world.\n1) Fish Curry\nA popular version of fish curry in Goa is the Ambot-Tik which literally translates to Sour-Spicy. The sour comes from the use of the petals of the tart ‘Kokum solam’. Known to be a cooling agent and honoured for its medicinal value, the red-coloured fruit of ‘Kokum’ is the real king of Goan cuisine.\nGrounded coconut is mixed with red chillies, peppercorns, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, turmeric powdre, garlic and ginger to make a fine paste. Sliced onions, tamarind juice and green chillies are added along with a cup of water and salt. The mixture is cooked and dried mango and kokum are added in process. Later, fish is added and is cooked till ready. The dish is a hot favourite of all seafood lovers.\n2) Fish Recheado\nRecheado means stuffed in Portuguese and in this recipe, a fresh whole fish, usually a mackerel or pomfret, is slit down the center and stuffed with a spicy red paste, after which it is shallow fried. Mackerel Recheado is one of Goa’s most famous dishes. Other fish can be used is well. The fiery-red Recheado masala made of kashmiri red chilies, garlic, cumin, peppercorns and tamarind is ground into a smooth but thick paste using vinegar. It is very versatile and can be used to prepare many other Goan seafood dishes. The Recheado masala can be made and stored in an airtight container for months as the vinegar in it acts as a preservative.\n3) Prawn Balchao\nPrawn Balchão is another Goan favourite. Brought to Goa by the Portuguese, Balchão originated in Macao, where it is called Balichao. Balchao is a method of cooking either fish or prawns in a dark red and tangy sauce. Balchao is almost like pickling and can be made days in advance without reheating. The traditional Balchao uses a paste made from dried shrimp known as ‘galmbo’ in Konkani spices and feni(see below. This paste is added to fresh prawns, onion, spices and oil to prepare a prawn balchao. Balchao is often bottled and eaten as an accompaniment in meals. But many people leave out the dried shrimp paste as this lends a fairly strong fishy flavour to the dish.\n– Pork\nPork is a popular meat available in Goa. Though the Hindu’s and Muslims of the state don’t eat pork because of religious constraints, it is widely popular among the Christian community and is in the main dishes of any festival or celebration. Vindaloo and Sorpotel are among the most famous pork dishes of Goa along with their spicy chourico sausages.\n4) Pork Vindaloo\nPork is a must for any festive occasion in Goa and the most famous preparation is the vindaloo. There are diverse interpretations of the etymology for this word one being ‘vinho’ for wine, ‘alhos’ for garlic (Portuguese), ‘viande’ and ‘aloo’ for meat and potato (French and Hindustani). It is a spicy concoction, lots of red chilies, garlic, cooked with chunks of pork, Goa vinegar, and hard palm jaggery and is best enjoyed with plain boiled rice.\n5) Sorpotel\nSorpotel is unarguably the essence of Goan Christian cuisine. Adapted from the Portuguese dish of Sarabulho, it is served traditionally at Christmas and on feast days. Sorpotel is one of those classic dishes that truly highlights the melange of Goan and Portuguese cultures in the cuisine of this state – Goan because of the generous use of spices; Portuguese because of the use of vinegar, which is hardly seen elsewhere.\nSorpotel is prepared from pork, liver, heart and kidney, all of which are diced and cooked in a thick and very spicy sauce favored with red chilies, cinnamon, cloves bathed in tangy toddy vinegar, which is needed to balance the strong taste of pig’s blood: another traditional ingredient of this revered dish. The Blood is not used in recent versions of the dish as it is not to eceryone’s taste. Sorpotel, like balchao, keeps for several days, and is actually considered to taste better if left for three to four days before being reheated.\n6) Chouricos (Spicy Goan Sausages)\nChouricos are spicy pork sausages, which owe more than a passing debt to Portuguese culinary traditions. Goan sausages are prepared used well salted and spiced cubes of pork. Once they have been made, the strings of sausages are dried in the sun and then hung above the fire where they are gradually smoked. Traditionally they are eaten during the monsoon, when fish is scarce. To prepare them, they are soaked in water and then usually fried and served with a hot sauce and rice.\n– Chicken\nChicken is popular as a meat all over India as well as in Goa. In Goa it is prepared in different sauces or dry fried with spices.\n7) Chicken Cafreal\nA Goan dish of tribal origin is cafreal. It was named after the African soldiers or Kaffirs who brought it to Goa centuries ago. Today, the dish is made by marinating pieces of chicken in a paste made of spices, chilies, garlic and ginger and lemon juice and then deep-fried or shallow fries till dry. The result is rather dry, but spicy dish. This is the equivalent of Portuguese-style grilled chicken and the sauce it is marinated in tastes a lot like the famous Portuguese Peri-peri sauce.\n8) Chicken Xacuti\nThis one will be loved by those who prefer a spicy preparation tremendously. Xacuti (pronounced as sha-coo-ti), makes use of plenty of spices like nutmeg, coriander leaves, red and green chillies, ginger and cloves. Additionally tamarind and lemon juice make for a pungent curry. The recipe can also be made with mutton, lamb or fish.\n– Sweets\nOffering an impeccable blend of European extravagance and simplicity of Konkan cooking, the sweetmeats of Goa are a must try for every holidayer. Although, the desserts are kept simple in Konkan, it takes a lot of effort to create those culinary magic dishes. Many of Goa’s most popular cakes, including the rich ‘Bebinca’, were developed in Goa’s convents and monasteries, where time was never in short supply. Their sweets usually have the same core ingredients of rice flour, coconut milk, palm jaggery, semolina and eggs, from which a formidable array of sweets and savouries are created.\n9) Bebinca\nThe most famous Goa’s sweetmeats is bebinca also known as bibik.It is a wonderful concoction made from layer upon layer of coconut pancakes. The extract of coconut milk is added to flour, sugar,eggs and ghee and other delectable ingredients are used to make this delicacy. Each scrumptious layer has to be baked before the next one is added, traditionally it has 16 layers but can be made with less or more. The dessert is baked in a specially-made clay oven, with hot coal as a source of heat, placed above. Though the process of making bebinca is tedious process the dessert is a mouth-melting dream.\n10) Dodol\nDodol is another famous Goan sweet, traditionally eaten at Christmas time, and made with rice flour, coconut milk, jaggery and cashew nuts. It is usually cooled in a flat pan and served in slices, and is very sweet.\nAnd to wash that all down…the Local Drink Feni!\nAn accompaniment to wash down all Goan food is the locally brewed feni. The Goans probably first distilled this from the fermented sap of the coconut flower-stalk, but later they also made it from the fruit of the cashew tree which the Portuguese had brought to the state with them. Though other forms of liquor are readily available across the state, the Goans are as emotional about their feni as they are about their food.\nThere are two types of feni, both of which are made from local ingredients. Coconut or palm feni is made from the sap drawn from the severed shoots on a coconut tree. In Goa this is known as toddy, and the men who collect it are toddy taper’s. Cashew or caju feni, on the other hand, can only be made during the cashew season in late March and early April.\nUndoubtedly Goa’s most famous triple, double distilled perfectly clear and fearfully potent (has an alcoholic strength of around 30% yo 35% proof), this is a drink which deserves respect. Goans are keen to offer advice not to drink it on an empty stomach and mix with other spirits and certainly don’t swim after a couple of fenis. But the best you will hear is ‘you don’t realise how strong it is until you get up’.",

Cooked with fresh tomatoes, garlic, ginger and garnished with fresh\ncoriander and selected spices.\nBalti is more a style of cooking than one particular curry, developed in Birmingham\ntwenty or thirty years ago. There are a number of theories on the origin of the term\nBalti, some say Balti describes the cooking pot and others say it refers to a style of\ncooking that evolved in Baltistan, somewhere on the North West frontier.\nThe word balti can be translated as \"bucket\". A balti pan is basically a karahi which\nhas the shape of a Chinese wok but with 2 small round handles on either side of the\npan instead of one long handle. In specialist \"Balti Houses\" the balti is a meal in itself\nwhich contains both meat and vegetables and is eaten straight from the karahi using\nNans, Chapatis and Parathas. In standard Indian restaurants the balti is more of a stir-\nfried curry containing plenty of fried green peppers and fresh coriander.\nMILD TO MEDIUM. The main item of these dishes is fried in oil together with\nspecially cooked basmati rice, flavoured with saffron and served with a vegetable curry\nsauce.\nBiryani is not a curry at all but the curry connection comes from the mixed vegetable\ncurry with which it is served in most Indian restaurants.\nBiryani originated in Persia and, at its simplest, was rice and meat baked together in\nthe oven. The meat and vegetables are pre-cooked and then mixed with the pillau rice.\nThe cooks to the Mogul emperors took the biryani and transformed it into a courtly\ndelicacy by adding aromatic spices and other exotic ingredients. Traditionally, biryanis\nare baked in the oven for some time so the aromatic spices and juices from the meat\npermeate the rice. In the Indian restaurant, however, all the dishes are made to order\nand the poor chef has to find a way of preparing the biryani in double quick time. So\nthe restaurant biryani is often just pilau rice stir fried with chicken or lamb which has\nbeen cooked as an extra dry bhuna. The restaurant biryani is usually garnished with\nalmonds and sultanas and is accompanied by a mixed vegetable curry to add a little\njuiciness to the rice.\nSWEET AND SOUR. A beautiful combination of spices with pineapple, lentils and\ngarlic.\nA famous Parsee dish. Interestingly the dhan part of the name means rice and a\ndhansak is traditionally served with a pulao of fried and spiced rice. An authentic\ndhansak will be made with lamb and contain vegetables and many different types of\ndhal (the sak in the name). The curry house dhansak is often referred to as \"hot, sweet\nand sour with lentils\". The \"hot\" is chilli powder, the \"sweet\" is sugar and the \"sour\" is\nlemon juice. Curry houses commonly use masoor dhal (split red lentils) but some\nrestaurants now use chana dhal to good effect. If it is done well the dhansak is an\nexcellent curry with contrasting flavours and textures.\nThe serving varies from restaurant to restaurant, but often expect a pineapple ring to\nbe included in the curry for added sweetness and contrast. The strength depends on\nthe chef .\nMEDIUM. A maximum quantity of onions, seasoned and fresh to produce a taste of\nmedium to hot.\nTypically this is a fairly basic Indian restaurant curry, prepared as a Bhuna or Bhoona\nbut with the addition of extra onions probably both in the cooking and as a garnish. It\nis also the same strength as a Bhuna which is medium, so not in the Madras league.\nThe dopiaza is a classic Indian dish dating back at least to Mogul times. The name\ndopiaza broadly translates as \"2 onions\" or \"double onions\". Some traditional versions\nof the dopiaza use twice the weight of onions compared to the weight of meat but a\nclassic Indian dopiaza is more likely to use the onions in 2 different ways, fried and\nboiled, at different stages of the cooking. The restaurant version has small fried pieces\nof onion in the sauce and then larger chunks of lightly cooked onion are added\ntowards the end of the cooking. Medium hot.\nJalfrezi\nFAIRLY HOT. Cooked with onions, tomato, green chillies, pepper and coriander.\nJalfrezi is not a traditional Indian dish as such but, like the bhuna, is actually a method\nof cooking. It literally means \"hot-fry\" but is probably better translated as \"stir-fry\".\nThe term jalfrezi entered the English language at the time of the British Raj in India.\nColonial households employed Indian cooks who would use the jalfrezi method of\ncooking to heat up cold roasted meat and potatoes. But the restaurant jalfrezi is not a\nversion of the Anglo-Indian dish. The Indian restaurant chef uses the jalfrezi method\nto stir-fry green peppers, onions and plenty of green chillies as the basis for a curry\nwith just a little sauce. The chillies make the jalfrezi taste very fresh but also make it\none of the hotter curries on the restaurant menu.\nMEDIUM. Small pieces of lamb or chicken cooked with onions, garlic, ginger,\npeppers, green chillies and fresh tomatoes.\nMany Indian restaurants had a balti-style curry on their menu long before the rise in\npopularity of balti cooking in the UK. They did not call the curry a balti but rather a\nkorai or karahi and many restaurants still carry one on their menu. Both the balti and\nkorai contain stir fried meat and vegetables and both take their name from the utensil\nin which they are cooked. Because korai is a style of cooking rather than a traditional\nrecipe the curry house versions can vary considerably from restaurant to restaurant. It\ncan be medium or hot and will usually contain green peppers, tomatoes and onions.\nVERY MILD. A delicious partnership of yoghurt, coconut cream and spices producing\na very mild but creamy texture.\nKorma is the definitive mild curry on the Indian restaurant menu. It is typically\nprepared with butter and thickened with single cream and coconut milk to give a very,\nvery mild creamy sauce. Spicing would be more subtle, and there would be more use\nof aromatic spices such as cardamom, clove and cinnamon rather than the more robust\nspices such as chilli, cumin, black pepper etc.\nA traditional korma will have a long slow cooking. In fact, korma is not one particular\ndish but rather a method of cooking similar to braising. Because korma is a cooking\nmethod there are a wide variety of dishes that could be described as \"korma\". Many\nkormas call for the meat to be marinated in yoghurt and then the meat plus marinade\nare braised on a very low heat until all the juices condense down into a thick sauce.\nThe restaurant chef has to cook to order so doesn't have time for long, slow cooking.\nThe korma you find in Indian restaurants usually contains ground almonds, coconut\nand thick cream. It is often described on restaurant menus as being \"very mild\" but a\ngood korma should not be bland.\nFAIRLY HOT. A south Indian version of curry dishes having a greater proportion of\ntomato purée and spices which lend a fiery taste to its richness.\nThe curry house Madras is a restaurant invention which started life as simply a hotted\nup version of the standard restaurant curry. Because it is a restaurant invention rather\nthan a traditional recipe the Madras can vary considerably from one restaurant to\nanother. The restaurant Madras can be hot or very hot, red or brown, a hotter version\nof a plain curry or quite rich in tomatoes. Mostly though it comes with plenty of sauce\nand is strongly spiced. It is the standard restaurant hot curry.\nThe Mogul dynasty ruled much of the Asian sub-continent for 3 centuries and left\nbehind a fabulous legacy not just in art and architecture but also in sumptuous cuisine.\nThere is no one Mogul style but the usual restaurant interpretation is rich and creamy.\nThe curry house Moghlai contains plenty of ginger, ground almonds, yoghurt and\ncream. Some restaurants offer a Shahi Mogul dish which is garnished with a small\nomelette flavoured with chopped coriander leaves. Mild to medium.\nPassanda\nDerived from a court dish of the Mogul emperors the pasanda is traditionally made\nwith thinly sliced and marinated lamb fillets. It is sometimes called lamb badam\npasanda because the dish contains ground almonds, the \"badam\" of the title. The\nrestaurant pasanda is usually quite mild and contains ground almonds, cardamom\npods, puréed tomatoes and cream.\nSOUR AND HOT. Extensive use of garlic, tomato purée red chilli and black pepper. A\ngood alternative to one who likes madras or vindaloo.\nLike it's more famous cousin, dhansak, patia is a Parsee dish. A traditional Parsee patia\nis made with fish cooked in a dark vinegar sauce. The restaurant patia is hot, sweet\nand sour in equal measure. The restaurant patia grew popular as a starter using prawns\nas the main ingredient. Many restaurants now offer the patia as a main course as well\nand give you the choice of a prawn, chicken or lamb version. It is usually garnished\nwith fried tomato pieces.\nRogan Josh\nMEDIUM. A special preparation of pimento, garlic and garnished with tomatoes.\nRogan josh is another all time favourite on the curry house menu. It was originally a\nKashmiri dish but is equally at home in the Punjab. An authentic rogan josh will be\nmade with lamb and may, at its most elaborate, contain dozens of spices. The\nKashmiri and Punjabi versions do differ (the Kashmiri does not traditionally contain\nonions or garlic) but they are both highly spiced and share a deep red colour derived\nfrom the liberal use of dried red Kashmiri chillies. The curry house rogan is also red\nbut the colour comes from red peppers and tomatoes rather than Kashmiri chillies. The\nrestaurant rogan is characterised by its garnish of tomato pieces and fresh coriander.\nSaag gosht is a classic curry traditionally made with spinach and lamb. Saag is, strictly\nspeaking, a general term for tender green leaves such as spinach, mustard greens and\nfresh fenugreek leaves. If you were talking about spinach on its own it would be\ncalled palak. Many restaurants these days will offer a chicken or a prawn alternative to\nlamb and so the dish will show on the menu as just \"saag\" or \"palak\" omitting the\ngosht (lamb) from the name altogether. The saag is usually served medium hot and is\nmade in the bhuna style.\nRestaurant Style Recipe\nTikka\nTikka is prepared in a similar way to a Tandoori dish. However it is usually a piece of\nfillet meat, chicken or fish that is cooked on a skewer, whereas Tandoori dishes are\nusually a whole portion of meat such as a Chicken quarter or half.\nTikka Masala\nMEDIUM. Onion, peppers, fresh tomatoes, coriander fried together with selected\nspices and herbs to produce a dry dish.\nChicken tikka masala is the all time most popular dish on the Indian restaurant menu\nand what the restaurant diner really needs to know is whether the restaurant is\nproviding a good example of the dish. And what is a good example? Well, the chicken\ntikka pieces should be aromatic and slightly smoky from the tandoor. The masala\nsauce should be well spiced but not hot, rich and creamy and have a hint of coconut.\nTikka masala usually has a deep red colour, gained from the use of artificial food\ncolourings.\nThe Tikka Massala curry is made with Tikka meat. That is, meat that has been\nmarinated and cooked on skewers in a Tandoor before being used in the curry\npreparation. The Massala is the curry sauce that the Tikka is served in. It is a creamy\nmild and colourful dish, often appearing day-glow red due to the addition of the red\nfood colouring (not recommended) either in the Tikka process or in the Massala or\nboth. It is prepared in the same way as a basic curry dish but with the addition of\npossibly yoghurt and just before serving, single cream.\nVERY HOT. A south Indian dish widely known for its rich hot taste. Black pepper,\nlemon, garlic and red chilli and a few strong spices.\nThe vindaloo was originally a Portuguese dish which took its name from the 2 main\ningredients which were \"vinho\", wine/wine vinegar, and \"alhos\", garlic. Over time it\nwas spiced up, hotted up and otherwise changed by the indigenous peoples of the ex-\nPortuguese colony of Goa. Not many restaurants produce an authentic Goan vindaloo\nnot least because the pork used by Christian Goans in their recipe would not be\nacceptable to Muslim chefs. In some restaurants the vindaloo is just a pumped-up\nMadras i.e. the same recipe but with lots more chilli powder. Other restaurants have\ninterpreted the \"aloo\" part of the name as meaning potato and introduced diced potato\nto a hot standard curry with added lemon juice for tartness and black pepper for extra\npungency.",
                "curry | The Domestic Man\nThe Domestic Man\nGluten-free & Paleo-friendly recipes, inspired by traditional & international cuisines.  New recipes every Tuesday.\nConnect\nBeef Rendang\nI’m often asked what is my favorite dish to prepare; it basically comes with the territory in this line of work.  While it’s hard to choose a favorite, Beef Rendang often comes to mind – there’s truly no taste like it.\nRendang is a dry curry that originated among the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra and later spread throughout Indonesia and Malaysia. Its age is unknown, but historians have traced its origin as far back as 500 years.  There are three recognized forms of rendang in Minangkabau culture, each depending on the cooking time: a pale, lightly cooked curry known as gulai; a browned but still liquid curry called kalio; and a rich, dry, dark brown dish called rendang, the version prepared in this recipe. In other countries, most notably Malaysia and the Netherlands, the rendang most often served is closer to kalio.  While its extended cooking time can be a test of patience, it’s well worth the wait; the aroma and overwhelming richness of rendang are unforgettable.\nI first published a rendang recipe nearly four years ago, and it’s made some slight but significant changes since then.  Earlier this year I made a batch, and took the photo you see above – it quickly became one of my favorite photos of the year, and so I figured it was a good excuse to share the updated recipe.  For the past year or two, this has been the version we’ve been making at home, as it has fewer steps and comes together very quickly.\nCurrywurst\nCurrywurst is a popular German dish, and a staple of fast-food eating in the country.  Its influence is so far-reaching that the dish is even served at McDonald’s, and is almost always accompanied by its own iconic fork (I used a spork in my photo, a fair alternative).\nCurrywurst was first served in the 1950s, in Berlin, as an object of Western influence; ketchup was introduced from the UK following World War II, and later paired with sausages, fries, and curry powder – the basic elements of Currywurst.\nFor today’s recipe, we’ll make a quick tomato sauce, subtly spiced, and serve it with your choice of sausage — anything from bratwurst to hot dogs will work.  Before we build the sauce, be sure to get some potatoes in the oven, as they’re the most time-consuming element of this dead-simple recipe.\nChicken Korma\nIn my new office here in Pensacola Florida, we have an interesting combination of Navy families.  Two of my co-workers have spouses they met while stationed in England, and another met his wife while serving in Canada.  I’ll often ask them what new dishes they’d like for me to bring into work, as they typically (and unknowingly) are my tasting judges.  The question inevitably gets passed to their spouses, and all too often I hear complaints that there are “no good curries” to be found in our town.  This Chicken Korma recipe is the result of those conversations.\n“Korma” comes from the Urdu word ḳormā, which means to braise.  This dish, as with other braised dishes like Rogan Josh , is characteristic of Moghul cuisine, which was first introduced to Northern India by the Mughal Empire in the 16th Century; the Mughal were a predominantly Muslim people of Turko-Mongol descent (some claimed to be direct descendants of Genghis Khan).\nThere is a lot of variation to kormas, but the underlying theme includes a slow braise in a rich, mildly-spicy curry sauce, often flavored with yogurt or heavy cream.  For this recipe in particular, I kept it relatively dairy-free (what’s a recipe without butter or ghee?) and used a bit of lemon juice to impart the tanginess you’d expect from using yogurt.\nLamb Vindaloo\nVindaloo is a curry dish originating in the Goa region of West India.  It is actually the Indian interpretation of the Portuguese dish Carne de Vinha D’Alhos (Meat with Wine and Garlic), borrowed from the Portuguese colony in Goa.  The original dish is seasoned with vinegar, and that slightly sour taste remains in most Indian interpretations today.\nWhile you’ll find potatoes in Vindaloos at many Indian restaurants worldwide, Vindaloo purists will argue that the dish shouldn’t have potatoes; what’s interesting is that the original Portuguese dish does indeed feature potatoes.  So they were lost at some point, only to find their way back again.  The Indian dish does stray from its source, though: Carne de Vinha D’Alhos is usually made with pork, and the Vindaloos you’ll find in Indian restaurants is most often made with lamb.  Likewise, the Indian dish is moderately spicy, unlike its Portuguese counterpart.  For this recipe, I kept the heat fairly mild; to spice it up, simply add more chili powder.\nAfter such a warm reception to my pressure-cooker Instant Stew recipe from a couple weeks ago, I decided to make this dish using my Instant Pot electric pressure cooker as well.  For those of you without a pressure cooker, fear not: stovetop instructions are included.  At its essence, the recipes are the same; the pressure cooker just cuts down the cooking time considerably.\nMoroccan Goat Curry (Tagine Makfoul)\nTagine Makfoul is a traditional Moroccan curry made with goat or lamb.  When my friends Brent and Heather of Virginia is for Hunter-Gatherers recently invited us over for dinner, promising some goat shoulder to accompany their excellent company, I knew that this recipe was the perfect choice; goat becomes tender after extended cooking, and serving it with makfoul (caramelized onion and tomatoes) adds a deliciously sweet and fresh dynamic to an already tasty dish.\nThis post is actually the second of a joint collaboration with Brent and Heather – be sure to check out another dish that we made on that same day, Tom Kha Gai , which is hosted on their wonderful site.\nThai Green Chicken Curry\nI’m a big fan of Thai curries, and Green Curry is one of my favorites.  It’s been a couple years since I tackled my last Thai curry ( Panang Curry ), so I thought it was time to share another recipe.  Like in my Panang Curry recipe, this recipe is a template for you to adjust as you see fit; directions on how to change the protein or add vegetables are provided below the recipe.\nThe Thai word for Green Curry (แกงเขียวหวาน) actually translates to “Sweet Green Curry”, but that doesn’t imply that this dish is sweet.  Instead, “sweet green” means “light green” in Thai.\nWhile the idea of making curry from scratch may be initially daunting, nothing could be further from the truth.  My curry paste has quite a few ingredients, but all you do is basically throw them all together and purée; the paste will keep for a month in the fridge (or several months in the freezer) and there’s enough paste to make three curries.  Making the actual curry is even easier – it’s a 20-minute meal, if not less.\nMas Riha (Maldivian Fish Curry)\nBaltimore/DC friends: Come join me for a cooking demo and holiday social this Sunday!  $10 entry to cover grocery costs, space limited to 30 guests.  Click here for more info.  See you there!\nMas Riha is a fish curry from Maldives, the small group of islands to the Southwest of the Indian subcontinent (it’s officially the smallest country in Asia).  The dish is very representative of Maldivian cuisine, which is based on three main staples: fish, coconut, and starch.\nWhile many people associate curries with hot, humid weather, I prefer them in the cold of winter; to me, the contrast of bitter cold weather and tropical food tends to embolden the curry’s flavors.  This week is our first real glimpse of winter on the East Coast (there’s snow on the ground as I type this), so it seems like the perfect time to share this recipe.  Fish curry is just about perfect, since it needs so little time to cook; you can easily throw together this entire delicious meal in less than 30 minutes.\nChicken Panang Curry\nNOTE: An updated version of this recipe appears in my cookbook, The Ancestral Table .\nLike I had mentioned in my Panang curry paste recipe , Panang (also spelled พะแนง, Penang and Phanaeng) curry is a mild Thai curry that gets its name from the Malaysian island of Penang. It is similar to Thai red curry but is richer and creamier, and typically uses crushed peanuts as a major part of the dish (I personally use cashews). It is often served with beef, pork, chicken or shrimp in Thai restaurants in the United States, although beef is the traditional meat used in this dish.  We love to make this curry with all of these meats, but typically we use chicken for its taste and texture.\nPanang (พะแนง) Curry Paste\nNOTE: An updated version of this recipe appears in my cookbook, The Ancestral Table .\nPanang (also spelled Penang and Phanaeng) curry is a mild Thai curry that gets its name from the Malaysian island of Penang.  It is similar to Thai red curry but is richer and creamier, and typically uses crushed peanuts as a major part of the dish (I personally use cashews).  It is often served with beef, pork, chicken or shrimp in Thai restaurants in the United States, although beef is the traditional meat used in this dish.\nWhile the pre-made Panang curry pastes from Maesri and Mae Ploy are both excellent, they are more spicy than I would like.  Reducing the amount of paste used or adding extra coconut milk just makes for a bland meal, so I decided to develop a mild Panang curry paste of my own that could then be adjusted for spiciness.  As an added bonus, my recipe is also free of added sugar, unlike the pre-made pastes!\nClick here to see this paste in action, in my Chicken Panang recipe.\nRogan Josh (Kashmiri Lamb Curry)\nNOTE: An updated version of this recipe appears in my cookbook, The Ancestral Table .\nRogan Josh is a popular Kashmiri dish that is believed to have originated in Persia before making its way to Northern India and beyond (in Persian, “rogan” means clarified butter and “josh” means hot or passionate).  Its signature red color is historically the result of mild red Kashmiri chiles which were used in making this dish.  Over the years, many restaurants started using tomatoes in the dish to bring about that red color easily.  My recipe follows the more modern interpretation of the dish, mostly because you and I don’t have the money to travel to Kashmir for some chiles!  Well, maybe you do, but I most certainly do not.\nAn excellent cut of lamb for this dish was the other half of Lava Lake Lamb’s beautiful lamb shoulder (the other half was used to make shashlik ).  This slightly-fatty cut imparted a ton of flavor into the dish, which just tasted better and better the longer it simmered.\nI’m also happy to announce that this is my first recipe that features a printer-friendly version !  I’ll be sure to do this with every recipe from now on, and as I get the spare time I will go back and make printer-friendly versions of all my recipes.",
                "Food in Goa by Reshma Rodrigues - issuu\nissuu\nIssuu on Google+\nFOOD IN GOA BY ROMMEL FERNANDES\nThe small state of Goa in India is famous for its food. A Goan meal is incomplete without fish, rice and curry cooked with coconut. Apart from fish, pork, beef and chicken are widely consumed. Some of the popular non vegetarian dishes made in Goa are: Goan curry rice Goan curry rice (pronounced as 'Xitt Codi' in Konkani) is the staple diet of a Goan anywhere in the world. Goans in Goa have fish curry along with rice every day. Chicken / Pork Vindaloo \"Vindaloo\" is a fiery-hot \"sweet and sour\" style curry. The name Vindaloo is derived from the Portuguese dish \"Carne de Vinha d' Alhos\", which is a dish of meat, usually pork, with wine and garlic. The dish was originally modified in Mumbai by the substitution of vinegar for the wine, and the addition of red chillies. The dish evolved into the vindaloo curry dish in Goa, with the addition of a lot of traditional spices and using palm vinegar instead of red wine. Alternate terms are vindalho or vindallo. Chicken Xacuti Xacuti is pronounced as shakuti or shacooti. This is a unique dish that is made with poppy seeds, sliced/grated coconut and red chillies. Chicken Cafreal This is Portuguese-style grilled chicken and the sauce it is marinated in tastes a lot like the famous Portuguese peri-peri sauce. The preparation originated from the Portuguese colonies in the African continent. It was introduced to Goan cuisine by the Portuguese. The preparation involves onions, garlic, ginger, cinnamon, pepper, chillies, and fresh coriander leaves. Sorpatel Sorpatel (sometimes spelt Soropatel) is a dish made with the shoulders, neck, kidneys, liver and ears of the pig. The word \"sorpotel\" is derived from the Konkani word \"soro\" which means alcohol/liquor. The flavour of sorpatel improves with age so it should be prepared upto a week in advance before it is consumed. It is often eaten with \"sanna\" - a spongy, white, and slightly sweet steamed rice and coconut bread. It can also be enjoyed with \"pao\" (the Konkani word for bread) or rice. Chourisaan Chourisaan are spicy pork sausages. Goan sausages are prepared using salted and spiced cubes of pork. Once they have been made, the strings of sausages are dried in the sun and then hung above fire where they are gradually smoked. They are usually eaten by boiling them in water or are fried and served with rice.\nFish Rechad Fish rechad is fish stuffed with a red spice paste. Rechado means \"stuffed\" in Portuguese. Rechad is a very aromatic, flavorful and quite hot Goan masala that can be used for marinating. Goans normally use Mackerel but you can also find cooks using Pomfret or Kingfish in restaurants. Fish / Prawn Balchao Balchao is fish or prawn pickle. Brought to Goa by the Portuguese, Balch達o originated in Macao, where it is called Balichao.

                "Food in Goa by Peter Fernandes - issuu\nissuu\nIssuu on Google+\nFOOD IN GOA BY ROMMEL FERNANDES\nThe small state of Goa in India is famous for its food. A Goan meal is incomplete without fish, rice and curry cooked with coconut. Apart from fish, pork, beef and chicken are widely consumed. Some of the popular non vegetarian dishes made in Goa are: Goan curry rice Goan curry rice (pronounced as 'Xitt Codi' in Konkani) is the staple diet of a Goan anywhere in the world. Goans in Goa have fish curry along with rice every day. Chicken / Pork Vindaloo \"Vindaloo\" is a fiery-hot \"sweet and sour\" style curry. The name Vindaloo is derived from the Portuguese dish \"Carne de Vinha d' Alhos\", which is a dish of meat, usually pork, with wine and garlic. The dish was originally modified in Mumbai by the substitution of vinegar for the wine, and the addition of red chillies. The dish evolved into the vindaloo curry dish in Goa, with the addition of a lot of traditional spices and using palm vinegar instead of red wine. Alternate terms are vindalho or vindallo. Chicken Xacuti Xacuti is pronounced as shakuti or shacooti. This is a unique dish that is made with poppy seeds, sliced/grated coconut and red chillies. Chicken Cafreal This is Portuguese-style grilled chicken and the sauce it is marinated in tastes a lot like the famous Portuguese peri-peri sauce. The preparation originated from the Portuguese colonies in the African continent. It was introduced to Goan cuisine by the Portuguese. The preparation involves onions, garlic, ginger, cinnamon, pepper, chillies, and fresh coriander leaves. Sorpatel Sorpatel (sometimes spelt Soropatel) is a dish made with the shoulders, neck, kidneys, liver and ears of the pig. The word \"sorpotel\" is derived from the Konkani word \"soro\" which means alcohol/liquor. The flavour of sorpatel improves with age so it should be prepared upto a week in advance before it is consumed. It is often eaten with \"sanna\" - a spongy, white, and slightly sweet steamed rice and coconut bread. It can also be enjoyed with \"pao\" (the Konkani word for bread) or rice. Chourisaan Chourisaan are spicy pork sausages. Goan sausages are prepared using salted and spiced cubes of pork. Once they have been made, the strings of sausages are dried in the sun and then hung above fire where they are gradually smoked. They are usually eaten by boiling them in water or are fried and served with rice.\nFish Rechad Fish rechad is fish stuffed with a red spice paste. Rechado means \"stuffed\" in Portuguese. Rechad is a very aromatic, flavorful and quite hot Goan masala that can be used for marinating. Goans normally use Mackerel but you can also find cooks using Pomfret or Kingfish in restaurants. Fish / Prawn Balchao Balchao is fish or prawn pickle. Brought to Goa by the Portuguese, Balch達o originated in Macao, where it is called Balichao. Balchao is a method of cooking either fish or prawns in a dark red and tangy sauce.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT The author referred to various sources while compiling this piece and wants to thank the people who wrote the original stuff.

                "Lamb vindaloo,Lamb Vindaloo Recipe,How To Make Lamb Vindaloo  | Vahrehvah article\nEvery thing about Lamb vindaloo,Lamb Vindaloo Recipe,How To Make Lamb Vindaloo  | Vahrehvah :\n \n \nThe term Vindaloo derives from the Portugues popular dish “Carne de Vinha d’Alhos”, a meat preparation usually made of pork with wine and garlic. The dish evolved into the Vindaloo curry family when it received the treatment from the Goan cuisine of adding plentiful amounts of traditional spices and using malt vinegar instead of red wine. Now Vindaloo or Vindalu (in Konkani) is a dish originated in Goa. Often in restaurants, the recipe of the traditional vindaloo is mistaken and prepared with chicken or lamb mixed with potatoes. Traditional Vindaloos do not include potatoes , the discrepancy arising because the word “aloo” means potato in hindi.\n \nLamb Vindaloo traditionally is a spicy hot dish made with coconut, vinegar and lots of hot red chilli peppers. Chili pepper was introduced by Portuguese traders during 16th century and with this came the development of Vindaloo dishes in Goa.  Vindaloo is believed to be the oldest dish using chili pepper in India. Vindaloo is a popular dish in many parts of India.\n \nThe dish has gained popularity in Britain, Germany, the Middle East, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, where it is almost universally featured on Indian restaurant menus. As most of the Indians do not prefer the pork meat we shall use the lamb meat for preparing the Lamb Vindaloo.\n \nWash lamb well and apply salt and keep it a side for 1 hr. (Optional raw papaya blend in a blender and add to the lamb to cook fast or tender. Raw papaya paste is use as an tenderizer only). Soak all the red chilli , pepper corns, garlic , ginger, cloves, cinnamon , cumin seeds, mustard and sugar in vinegar and coconut milk  for 30min. Then blend till fine paste.\n \nThis would be the spicy masala for the vindaloo. After one hour take the lamb add all the spice mixture mix well and keep a side for 4 hours. After 4 hours take a pan add oil, lamb masala cook for 5min then add chopped onions. Cover the pan with a lid by adding some water and cook in a low flame. Cook till the lamb is tender or oil oozes out and turn into a red hot spicy sauce releasing the flavors of the freshly ground spices.  An awesome traditional spicy dish served with steaming hot rice. Wow! That’s a wonderful experience tasting the authentic age old recipe from the Goan cuisine.\n \nIn eastern states of India like the Orissa and West Bengal the same dish is prepared in marriage parties and also cooked during occasions (but not referred as Vindaloo). The idea behind adding potatoes in lamb curry is that lamb meat is costlier than chicken in India (three times costlier than chicken), hence people add potatoes to have more quantity and to make the curry thicker and tastier.\n \nAccording to folklore, a cook by mistake added more salt to the lamb curry. To balance the salt quantity in the curry he added some boiled potatoes. Since then it has become a practice to add potatoes to goat curry or lamb curry in Orissa and West Bengal. The popularity of the dish inspired the song “ Vindaloo \", the unofficial anthem of the England football team for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\n \nThe lamb vindaloo is simply scrumptious and continues its quest to redefine Indian cuisine – bringing the flavor of the lamb and spices to the foreground. This recipe is equally good substituting pork or beef for the lamb . Traditionally it calls for jaggery , a type of sugar, but an equal amount of dark-brown sugar can be substituted."

                "\"Jack and Jill\" (sometimes \"Jack and Gill\", particularly in earlier versions) is a traditional English nursery rhyme. The Roud Folk Song Index classifies this tune and its variations as number 10266. The rhyme dates back at least to the 18th century and exists with different numbers of verses each with a number of variations. Several theories have been advanced to explain its origins and to suggest meanings for the lyrics.\n\nLyrics and structure\n\nThe first and most commonly repeated verse is:\n\nJack and Jill went up the hill\nTo fetch a pail of water.\nJack fell down and broke his crown,\nAnd Jill came tumbling after.\n\nMany verses have been added to the rhyme, including a version with a total of 15 stanzas in a chapbook of the 19th century. The second verse, probably added as part of these extensionsP. Opie and I. Opie,The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), ISBN 0-19-869111-4, pp. 224–6. has become a standard part of the nursery rhyme.  Early versions took the form:\n\nUp Jack got, and home did trot,\nAs fast as he could caper;\nTo old Dame Dob, who patched his nob\nWith vinegar and brown paper.\n\nBy the early 20th century this had been modified in some collections, such as L. E. Walter's, Mother Goose's Nursery Rhymes (London, 1919) to:\n\nUp Jack got and home did trot,\nAs fast as he could caper;\nAnd went to bed and bound his head\nWith vinegar and brown paper.L. E. Walter, Mother Goose's Nursery Rhymes (1919, 1923, Forgotten Books), ISBN 1-4400-7293-0, p. 8.\n\nA third verse, sometimes added to the rhyme, was first recorded in a 19th-century chapbook and took the form:\n\nThen Jill came in, and she did grin,\nTo see Jack's paper plaster;\nHer mother whipt her, across her knee,\nFor laughing at Jack's disaster.\n\nTwentieth-century versions of this verse include:\n\nWhen Jill came in how she did grin\nTo see Jack's paper plaster;\nMother vexed did whip her next\nFor causing Jack's disaster.\n\nThe rhyme is made up of quatrains, with a rhyming scheme of abcb (with occasional internal rhymes), using falling rhymes (where the rhyming sound is on a relatively unstressed syllable: de-emphasising the rhyme) and a trochaic rhythm (with the stress falling on the first of a pair of syllables), known as a ballad form, which is common in nursery rhymes.  The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by the composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs (1870).  The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 10266. \n\nMeaning and origins\n\nThe rhyme has traditionally been seen as a nonsense verse, particularly as the couple go up a hill to find water, which is often thought to be found at the bottom of hills. Vinegar and brown paper were a home cure used as a method to draw out bruises on the body.C. Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: the Reason Behind the Rhyme (Colchester: Granta, 2nd edn., 2004), ISBN 1-86207-765-7, pp. 137–40. The phrase \"Jack and Jill\", indicating a boy and a girl, was in use in England as early as the 16th century. A comedy was performed at the Elizabethan court in 1567-8 with the title Jack and Jill and the phrase was used twice by Shakespeare: in A Midsummer Night's Dream, which contains the line: \"Jack shall have Jill; Nought shall go ill\" (III:ii:460-2) and in Love's Labour's Lost, which has the lines: \"Our wooing doth not end like an old play; Jack hath not Jill\" (V:ii:874–5), suggesting that it was a phrase that indicated a romantically attached couple, as in the proverb \"A good Jack makes a good Jill\".\n\nJack is the most common name used in English language nursery rhymes and by the 18th century represented an archetypal Everyman hero,  while by the end of the Middle Ages Jill or Gill had come to mean a young girl or a sweetheart.  However, the woodcut that accompanied the first recorded version of the rhyme showed two boys (not a boy and a girl), and used the spelling Gill not Jill. This earliest printed version comes from a reprint of John Newbery's Mother Goose's Melody, thought to have been first published in London around 1765.  The rhyming of \"water\" with \"after\", was taken by Iona and Peter Opie to suggest that the first verse may date from the first half of the 17th century.\n\nInterpretation\n\nWhile the true origins of the rhyme are unknown there are several theories. As is common with nursery rhyme exegesis, complicated metaphors are often said to exist within the lyrics of Jack and Jill. Most explanations post-date the first publication of the rhyme and have no corroborating evidence. These include the suggestion by S. Baring-Gould in the 19th century that the events were a version of the story told in the 13th-century Prose Edda Gylfaginning written by Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, who stated that in Norse mythology, Hjúki and Bil, brother and sister (respectively), were taken up from the earth by the moon (personified as the god Máni) as they were fetching water from the well called Byrgir, bearing on their shoulders the cask called Saegr and the pole called Simul. Around 1835 John Bellenden Ker suggested that Jack and Jill were two priests, and this was enlarged by Katherine Elwes in 1930 to indicate that Jack represented Cardinal Wolsey (c.1471–1530); and Jill was Bishop Tarbes, who negotiated the marriage of Mary Tudor to the French king in 1514. \n\nIt has also been suggested that the rhyme records the attempt by King Charles I to reform the taxes on liquid measures. He was blocked by Parliament, so subsequently ordered that the volume of a Jack (1/2 pint) be reduced, but the tax remained the same. This meant that he still received more tax, despite Parliament's veto. Hence \"Jack fell down and broke his crown\" (many pint glasses in the UK still have a line marking the 1/2 pint level with a crown above it) \"and Jill came tumbling after\". The reference to \"Jill\" (actually a \"gill\", or 1/4 pint) is said to reflect that the gill dropped in volume as a consequence.\n\nThe suggestion has also been made that Jack and Jill represent Louis XVI of France, who was deposed and beheaded in 1793 (lost his crown), and his Queen, Marie Antoinette (who came tumbling after), a theory made difficult by the fact that the earliest printing of the rhyme pre-dates those events.A. Jack, Pop Goes the Weasel: The Secret Meanings of Nursery Rhymes (London: Penguin, 2008), ISBN 0-14-190930-7. There is also a local belief that the rhyme records events in the village of Kilmersdon in Somerset in 1697. When a local spinster became pregnant, the putative father is said to have died from a rock fall and the woman died in childbirth soon after.\n\nNotes"

                "Reef Madness 11: Darwin’s First Theory of Evolution | WIRED\nReef Madness 11: Darwin’s First Theory of Evolution\nA coral reef's evolution: fringing reef (top); barrier; atoll.\nThis is the 11th installment of an abridged version of my book Reef Madness: Alexander Agassiz, Charles Darwin, and the Meaning of Coral .  (Earlier installments are listed at bottom.) Here Darwin hatches the theory of coral reef formation that will start a decades-long argument with Alexander Agassiz — and create a template for his species theory.\n© David Dobbs, 2011. All rights reserved.\n____________\nEven as he was composing his Chile notes, Darwin was turning his mind west, for the Beagle, having finished its laborious survey of the South American coast, was making ready to sail. Examining charts of the route ahead, Darwin contemplated the oddity that is the Pacific: a broad pan, immensely deep, with arcs and ovals and doglegs of coral isles rising, as he put it, from its “profoundest parts.” Several of these archipelagos — the Galapagos, the Tuamotus, French Polynesia, the Fijis and the Friendlys — lay along the Beagle‘s route. In the 60 years since Captain James Cook had mapped them, these islands had commanded much interest among geologists and naturalists. They were intrigued by the great depths from which they rose; by their volcanic nature; by their ordered but irregular arrangements, like pearl necklaces tossed to the floor; and by the islands’ distinctive annularity.\nSomeone excited sleepless by geology wasn’t likely to resist such shapes. Darwin’s Andean wanderings and ruminations had fired what would prove an insatiable appetite for discovering patterns spanning space and time. These ringed islands presented precisely such a pattern.\nThe puzzle seemed ripe for solution. Though coral islands and reefs had intrigued Europe’s scientists and public for almost a century (an interest greatly boosted by the descriptions Cook brought back of the South Pacific archipelagos in the 1770s), no one had plausibly explained how they came to be. They were initially appreciated mainly for the sheer wonder of their existence, apparently climbing from the sea’s depths to create new landscapes. In the eighteenth-century fascination with the idea of a Great Chain of Being, corals held a special place for seeming to bridge the gap between plant and animal, and after Jean-Andre Peyssonnel showed them to be animals in 1753, for creating with their calcified skeletons the huge structures that joined the organic and the inorganic worlds as well as sea and land. In the early nineteenth century, some saw in coral reefs a welcome antidote to the erosion that Huttonian geology saw as erasing humankind’s terrestrial platform. “Whatever destroying tendencies … exist on the earth,” wrote one prominent geologist in 1818, “these renovating powers compensate for them.”\nSuch speculations rose naturally when geology was so young, the reefs so many, and scientific visits to them so few and brief. Naturalists on the Cook and other expeditions of the late 1700s, however, began to fill in the blanks. They established that the reefs were formed by the accumulating skeletons of huge colonies of tiny, tube-shaped animals known as coral polyps. These polyps, which would later be found to be tiny, hard-bodied cousins of sea anenomes, were also variously referred to as insects, “molluscus worms,” insects, or even “animalcules.” They seemed to live only in warm tropical waters, generally no further than 25 or 30 degrees of the equator. The polyps apparently built their great works extremely slowly. No one who lived in coral regions described discernible growth, and while nineteenth-century European visitors comparing the reefs to descriptions and charts made the previous century found some reef areas apparently torn up by storms, they could not find measurable expansion. At first it was thought that the reefs might build themselves up from seabottom as deep as several hundred or even several thousand feet. But by 1820 it had been established that corals grew only in water no more than 100 or 200 feet deep.\nThese observations presented two critical mysteries. One was how shallow-water animals came to grow on platforms that rose from the Pacific’s greatest depths. Did they just happen to find these plateaus, or did they somehow build them? The other puzzle was the distinctive annularity of reefs surrounding islands, of many coral islands themselves, and even of the vast coral atolls, or groups of islands, that were strung around the Pacific. The reefs surrounding islands followed their contours, often ringing them with a calm lagoon between reef and shore. Other reefs surrounded lagoons only, with no island in the lagoon’s center. And the Pacific’s many atolls – collections of smaller coral islands — often took ringlike or looplike forms themselves. With so many reefs and atolls taking circular and ovoid forms, it seemed unlikely that reefs just happened to grow on convenient platforms. Some dynamic relationship between the reefs and their foundations seemed to shape them.\nThe first coral reef theories, offered in the late 1700s and early 1800s, gave fairly simplistic or teleological answers to these questions. For instance, J.R. Forster, the naturalist on Cook’s second voyage in the mid-1770s, proposed that corals simply knew they needed to build a circular structure to give themselves a sheltered environment. Another early theory, that of the naturalist and vulcanist Christian Leopold von Buch (1774-1853), had coral reefs growing on the rims of “elevation craters” that had formed when huge, gaseous blisters — quite distinct from volcanoes — raised the sea bottom and then popped and collapsed. This theory, which ignored the fact that every major known reef area lay in volcanic areas, was a strange one coming from von Buch, for he was a noted vulcanist, having firmly established, early in the 1800s, that lava formed new rock. Von Buch’s discovery of the volcanic nature of rock greatly advanced uniformitarianism, for catastrophist theory had maintained that all the earth’s rocks and land had long before precipitated from a primordial ocean. Yet this pioneering vulcanist overlooked the seemingly obvious connection between coral reefs and volcanoes. A few other reef scientists, citing what seemed plain in Caribbean and Atlantic reefs, which rose from shallower depths, offered that most reef platforms consist of current-deposited sediment.\nThe first theory to get wide acceptance, however, was that of Johann Eschscholtz, who visited the Marshall Islands on an 1815-1818 Russian voyage led by Otto von Kotzebue. Eschscholtz hypothesized that corals grow faster to seaward, responding ot the influx of oxygen and food, and so that as they rise on existing platforms (as he saw it), they slowly create a bulwark that increasingly grows faster on its sea-facing side. They grow from the center outward, in other words. This, he explained, creates a tendency toward annularity that, along with the shape of the platforms they grew on, accounts for each reef’s form. Though Eschscholtz overextended this idea to unlikely deeps because the depth limit of coral growth wasn’t established until just after he offered his theory, his hypothesis seemed to account for many reef forms and helped to explain lagoons.\nEschscholtz experienced mixed luck with this theory. While his reef-building model exerted immense influence, it was incorrectly attributed for 75 years (50 years beyond Eschscholtz’s death) to his colleague on Kotzebue’s voyage, a poet-naturalist named Chamisso. In any event, the Chamisso-Eschscholtz hypothesis, especially its assertion that coral reefs grow faster to the seaward, shaped thinking about reefs for a century, giving rise to many other theories.\nForemost among these other theories, and the one that came closest to enjoying a consensus in the early 1800s, was what might be called an elevated-volcano theory. This held that most of the world’s coral reefs grew on volcanic mountaintops that had risen close to the surface, presumably lifted by mountain-building surfaces similar to those on land,, and then expired, leaving the round ring of the volcano’s mouth near the surface. The round shape of many islands and atolls supported this idea, as did existence of old coral on some islands lifted well out of the water. For how would those corals have reached terrestrial mountaintops if the mountains hadn’t been pushed from below the surface?\nThis raised-volcano hypothesis, as it happens, was the one backed by Lyell and presented in Principles of Geology as the most authoritative explanation. This theory held weaknesses too, however, and Darwin, pondering the charts in Chile, found them conclusively damning. Yes, he recognized, many isles had risen well above the surface, suggesting elevation. But the charts showed that those taller islands were vastly outnumbered by the thousands of coral isles and atolls, including archipelagos hundreds of miles long, that barely cleared the water. The above-water portions of these low structures were clearly created by coral debris and sand being tossed atop subsurface reefs. Was he to accept that the foundations of all these isles had conveniently risen to within a couple hundred feet of waterline and then stopped growing so that coral could complete the trip? Hardly. As he put it in the Voyage of the Beagle,\nIt is [highly] improbable that the elevatory forces should have uplifted throughout … vast areas, innumerable great rocky banks within 20 to 30 fathoms … of the surface of the sea, and not one single point above that level; for where on the whole surface of the globe can we find a single chain of mountains, even a few hundred miles in length, with their many summits rising within a few feet of a given level, and not one pinnacle above it?\nBesides, he noted, the span of many atolls, some of them rough circles dozens of miles in diameter, others oblongs 30 miles by 6 or 50 by 20, could hardly mark the rims of volcanoes, for where had ever been volcanic craters so large or oddly shaped?\nHe didn’t care either for the second most popular hypothesis then around, which was that reef platforms accumulated through sedimentation.\nIt is improbable in the highest degree that broad, lofty, isolated steep-sided banks of sediment, arranged in groups and lines hundreds of leagues in length, could have been deposited in the central and profoundest parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, at an immense distance from any continent, and where the water is perfectly limpid.\nBut what could explain these huge chains and rings of coral? Some of these island groups stretched hundreds of miles. At least one pair of Pacific archipelagoes, the Low and the Radack, together had hundreds of low, coral isles spread along a line over 4000 miles long, and a similar formation 1500 miles long curved across the Indian Ocean. All of these isles grew atop shallow platforms showed falling away steeply to immense depths. What could have created such long curves and circles of shallow platforms rising from deep water?\nDarwin, having pondered for weeks the image of South America rising next to a falling Pacific, saw what now seemed to him obvious: The Pacific’s coral islands did not form on rising mountains; they formed on islands and the high points of large land masses — possibly even continents — that were slowly sinking.\nThe thought, he said later, came to him in a flash while he was still on the coast pondering charts. Indeed, his notes and correspondence show that he first saw the Pacific reefs not so much as something to be explained, but as evidence of a Pacific subsidence that balanced the rise of the Andes. In his Autobiography (not too many pages before claiming he developed his evolutionary theory through “strict Baconian methods”), he confesses of the coral reef theory that “No other work of mine was begun in so deductive a spirit as this, for the whole theory was thought out on the west coast of South America, before I had seen a true coral reef.”\nThis was enough to make a Baconian inductivist quake. Yet Darwin could hardly reject his notion of falling islands, for it seemed to explain everything about reefs. In particular, the man who would later ponder variations in finch beaks found it particularly compelling that this idea explained why coral islands, reefs, and atolls took so many variations of ringlike or looping forms. The different reef and atoll forms reflected different stages in the subsidence of the islands on which they took root.\nTake a volcanic island, proposed Darwin. Corals would naturally form on the shallows surrounding it. At first this reef, which he called a “fringing reef,” would be thin, and would be directly against the islands shores. But if the island slowly dropped, these corals growing in its surrounding shallows would slowly grow upward, ever thickening but never breaking the surface, to provide a platform for yet more coral. The fringing reef would thicken and broaden, reaching further out to sea.\nThe fringing reef would soon change, however. Since corals grow more quickly toward the open ocean than toward protected water, the reef would grow faster toward the sea than it would toward the sinking island. As the shore sank, a lagoon would thus form between the reef and the land. The fringing reef would now be a barrier reef — that is, a reef with a lagoon or channel between it and the land it grew around. As time took the island ever further down, the reef would continue to thicken to stay near the surface, and it would continue to grow outward toward the sea.  Eventually the island would sink sank beneath the lagoon. Then the barrier reef would become an atoll — a ring of coral matching the former outlines of the island, but now surrounding only a calm lagoon. In the meantime or soon after, the waves might throw enough coral debris and sand atop the reefs to create some of the narrow, strip-shaped islands so common to the Pacific’s coral archipelagos.\nTo Darwin, this theory not only explained all three types of reefs — fringing, barrier, and atoll; it seemed to be the only theory that satisfactorily explained barrier reefs and atolls reefs at all. Fringing reefs could be explained simply by the fact that corals grew in shallow water. But barrier and atoll reefs required some other explanation, and no other explanation accounted for both of them. Even if you bought that circular atolls had grown on submerged volcanic rims, that idea didn’t explain barrier reefs or more oddly shaped or huge atolls, and it of course asked you to believe that in some areas thousands of these dead volcanoes reached to within 100 fathoms of the surface while none reached above. The other explanations either ignored common reef forms and features or asked us to believe the unbelievable. It was absurd to assert that thousands of mountains all came close to the surface without breaking it; only subsidence could explain these strings of low islands. And only subsidence could plausibly explain barrier reefs and atolls. The logical link was so strong, Darwin believed, that the barrier reefs and atolls in turn provided evidence of subsidence.\nThis was all from the west coast of South America. When he hopscotched across the Pacific and finally visited atolls and barrier reefs in Tahiti and at the Indian Ocean’s Cocos-Keeling islands, the sight of the formations — particularly the Tahitian island of Moorea, which sat surrounded by its lagoon and barrier reef like an engraving by its matt and frame, as he put it — confirmed to Darwin his vision’s accuracy. “I glad we have visited these islands,” he wrote in his diary, for the coral reefs “rank high amongst the wonderful objects in the world…. [They are] a wonder which does not at first strike the eye of the body, but, after reflection, the eye of reason.” As lovely as the reefs were in pure aesthetic terms (and Darwin keenly appreciated their beauty), they provided for him the even deeper thrill of embodying a deep, time-based pattern apparent only to the imaginative intellect.\nThis subsidence theory was an audacious idea for a 26-year-old. Conceptually ambitious and blatantly deductive, it begged trouble from all quarters. While challenging the coral-formation theory favored by the new leader of British geology — Lyell — it also aggressively pushed Lyell’s controversial gradualism and speculative method into new territory. As the Beagle rounded Africa and made for England in early 1836, Darwin worried how the senior colleagues be admired, particularly Henslow and Lyell, would receive it.\nHe was elated when, on his return in fall of 1836, the scientists most important to him, starting with Lyell, found it as thrilling as he did. When he told Lyell of the theory at a lunch at Lyell’s house soon after returning, Lyell became so excited he leapt around the room shouting and laughing, and he immediately dropped his own idea that reefs grew atop mountains that had risen. This idea, he agreed, was far more powerful and beautifully concise. Reefs were not caps atop mountains that had fallen short. They were, as Lyell put it in a letter telling Herschel, “the last efforts of drowning continents to lift their heads above water.”\nLyell immediately arranged to have Darwin read an abstract of the theory at the Geological Society. He warned Darwin that others might not share his own excitement. “Do not flatter yourself that you will be believed till you are growing bald like me, with hard work and vexation at the incredulity of the world.”  Yet to Darwin’s delight, he was believed almost immediately. The positive reception began as soon as he read his paper before the Geological Society, in July 1837. Herschel liked it, and Whewell did, too, despite its non-Baconian birth, for the thing worked. Darwin soon won over a wider circle with his presentation of the theory in the Voyage in 1839 and more fully in the 1842 Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs. Meanwhile, Lyell incorporated Darwin’s subsidence theory into his 1840 edition of Principles, making it quite literally the textbook explanation. Pacific investigations in the 1840s by the British researcher J.B. Jukes and a young James Dwight Dana seemed to confirm the theory. Jukes, having looked extensively at Pacific reefs, said Darwin’s explanation “rises beyond a mere hypothesis into the true theory of coral-reefs.”\nDoubters lurked. Some geologists found it difficult to envisage the tectonic movements of which Darwin said subsidence was part. One reviewer called such movements “bold and startling …  even to the most hardy of our geologists.” Another scientific reviewer hoped “to find the boldness of [Darwin’s] theories a little modified; and … resting upon a more solid foundation than the supposed undulations of subterranean fluid.” A few people found these objections quite damning. John Cluines Ross, in fact, the owner of Cocos-Keeling atoll, where Darwin saw the atolls that confirmed for him his theory, called it “palaver” and dismissed it out of hand.\nThese arguments worried Darwin only slightly, for he recognized they came from people who simply didn’t buy the Herschel-Lyell need to speculate. They were fair objections regarding rightly debatable conceptual issues. Of more concern was the way the existing empirical evidence often contradicted his theory and offered it little direct support. As skeptics noted, most of the coral isles studied so far showed much evidence of elevation and no sign of subsidence. Explorers had found corals and other marine fossils atop the taller islands, for instance, but no corresponding terrestrial fossils or structures beneath the surface. And though many (including Darwin) had observed contemporary elevation in action, no one had observed ongoing subsidence. Darwin’s defense — that the recent elevations were cycles amid an overall pattern of marine subsidence, the evidence for which had not been observed because it was hidden under water — couldn’t be backed by anything tangible.\nEven more troubling to Darwin was the lack of any discovered deep thickness of continuous coral in the world’s expanding catalogue of examined strata. Geologists had found many thick layers of marine sandstone and sedimentary limestone above ground; why no great thicknesses of coral? When Darwin and Lyell couldn’t resolve this one despite extensive discussion, Darwin had to admit it a “weighty and perplexing” objection.\nThese and other objections, however, scarcely slowed the theory’s acceptance. By 1850, Darwin’s theory, backed by Lyell and his own expanding base of supporters, became the single most widely accepted theory of coral reef formation. Meanwhile he moved on from it and other geology to work on barnacles and, quietly in the background, his transmutation theory. Even as he did so, the reef theory consolidated its hold. By the time he wrote his Autobiography, in 1876, he could accurately say of The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs that it was “thought highly of by scientific men, and the theory therein given is, I think, now well established.” He still got a kick out of its simple power and success; he said it gave him more pleasure than any other theory he’d ever come up with.\nFor good reason. It’s hard to overstate how vital Darwin’s coral reef theory was in developing his career and thinking. It paved the way, conceptually and methodologically, for everything to come — particularly his transmutation theory.  The likenesses startle. Like the transmutation theory, the coral reef theory described how small, virtually unnoticeable changes could create differences of essential type in seemingly immutable forms — and in doing so, account for broad patterns of development and difference.\nThematically, formally, and even psychologically, then, Darwin’s coral reef theory served almost as direct progenitor of his species theory. As perhaps nothing else could have, it prepared him for the conceptually similar but more difficult work on evolution and natural selection. He seems to have needed this dry run — a theoretical foray into the relatively tame territory of rocks and reefs — before pursuing a similar  argument on the more perilous species question. He barely thought about the species issue, in fact, until he had finished developing his coral concept. Though the raw zoological data and specimens he collected on the Beagle proved key to his evolution work, they did so only later. His expedition notebooks contain no real contemplation of evolution or variation until he was in Australia, well after his Galapagos visit and when he had just finished recording in his notebook, on the sail from Tahiti to Sydney, the first full abstract of his reef theory. With the abstract sketched out, he made in Australia a few brief notes on species variation, then resumed expanding his reef abstract on the Indian Ocean leg. Returning to London six months later, he told and wrote not of species variation, but of coral reef variation. It was only the following summer that Darwin, who always started a new, subject-specific notebook when he began thinking in earnest on some problem, started his first notebook on “transmutation of species.” That was in July 1837, the same month he had successfully presented his coral reef paper to the Geological Society and begun drafting its full explication in The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs. The one theory seemed almost to spring from the other.\nThe coral reef theory’s subsequent success doubtless helped sustain Darwin during the two decades that he agonized over his transmutation theory. But as he surely recognized  (and probably would have liked to forget), another early theory of his also shared the reef theory’s conceptual hallmarks: Glen Roy. His botched explanation of that valley’s parallel roads, published two years after his initial coral reef presentation, also sought to explain a geologic mystery by proposing a series of changes over long periods. It too sprang from a vision of rising and falling land masses. Yet in the decade after he published it, his Glen Roy theory fell to Louis Agassiz and became Darwin’s most painful humiliation. (“Eheu! Eheu!”) If his reef theory’s success buoyed him in his evolution work, the Glen Roy debacle served a sober warning. Indeed, the Glen Roy reversal gave ample reason to doubt his coral reef theory. He had erred at Glen Roy both by overlooking contradictory evidence (the streams that he missed but Agassiz found) and by downplaying the lack of direct confirming evidence, such as the missing marine fossils, as a type of evidence that was simply unlikely to be found. In his coral reef theory he chose to overlook the common signs of elevation and dismiss the absence of direct evidence of subsidence. Might these prove to be errors as fatal as those he made at Glen Roy? Darwin seemed to set aside such questions as the decades passed. But they were right there for anyone else to pick up.\n_______",

Understand what makes these Islands so  special with our range of interesting information and trivia.\nLearn about the amazing and unique animals, birds and creatures that live in the islands, where the Galapagos Islands are, how Charles Darwin's visit to the islands helped evolutionary thought and much more.\n \nThe Galapagos are an archipelago of  volcanic islands that span across the equator line.\nThe Galapagos Islands are located in  the Pacific Ocean, 926 km (575 mi) west of Ecuador,  South America, and are an offshore territory   of Ecuador.\nThe islands are home to over 25,000  people clustered in small towns, the capital is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno.\nThe Archipelago group consists of  7,880 km² (3,040 mi²) of land spread over 45,000 km² (17,000 mi²) of ocean.\nThe group consists of 18 main  islands, 3 smaller islands, and 107 islets or rocks. The largest of the islands  is Isabela which makes up nearly three-quarters of the total land area of the Galapagos islands at 5,827 km² (2,250 mi²).\nThe highest point in the Galapagos Islands is Volcán Wolf on Isabela which is 1,707  m (5,600 ft) above sea level.\nThe islands sit above the Galapagos  hotspot where the Earth's crust is being melted from below by a mantle plume,  which creates volcanoes . The oldest of the islands, more then 4 million years  old, are slowly disappearing back below sea level. The youngest islands Isabela  and Fernandina are still in the process of being formed with 13 volcanic  eruptions in the archipelago over the last 100 years.\nFive ocean currents converge at the Galapagos islands. The Equatorial, Cromwell, Humboldt,  and Panama  currents create variable water temperatures and unpredictable tides in the area  resulting in a unique marine ecology.\nThe Galapagos   islands became a national park in 1959. The islands were declared  a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978. In 1986, the surrounding ocean was  declared a biological marine reserve and in 1990 the area became a whale sanctuary.\nCharles Darwin famously visited the Galapagos islands for 5 weeks in 1835 on the ship HMS  Beagle. During his observations and collections he noted that mockingbirds, Darwin finches and  tortoises differed over the various islands. These facts contributed to the development  of Darwin's  theory of evolution by natural selection presented in his book 'The Origin of  Species'.\nDue to the uniqueness of the islands  and ocean waters there are vast numbers of endemic species including: Galapagos  land iguanas, marine iguana (the only iguana that feed in the sea), sea  cucumbers, flightless cormorant, blue-footed booby, Galapagos mockingbirds,  Galapagos Penguin, Galapagos sea lions, Galapagos hawk, great Frigatebird, waved  Albatross, and over 50  species of fish.\nThe most famous of the endemic Galapagos  creatures are the tortoises that the islands were named after. The giant  tortoises have slightly differing physical features depending on which island  they come from.\nUnfortunately, whalers and fur-seal  traders in the 18th-19th centuries killed and captured thousands of the  Galapagos tortoises to extract their fat. Because they can survive for months  without food or water the tortoises could be kept on board ships as a means of  providing of fresh protein . Some entire species of tortoises were lost to this  practise and others were on the verge of extinction.\nThe most famous resident of the Galapagos islands was Lonesome  George, who was the only surviving giant Pinta Island  tortoise left on Earth. He was known as the rarest creature in the world and  served as a symbol for conservation. Lonesome George died on the 24th June 2012  at the age of 100.",
                "Charles Robert Darwin facts, information, pictures | Encyclopedia.com articles about Charles Robert Darwin\nComplete Dictionary of Scientific Biography\nCOPYRIGHT 2008 Charles Scribner's Sons\nDarwin, Charles Robert\n(b. The Mount, Shrewsbury, England, 9 February 1809; d. Down House, Downe, Kent, England, 19 April 1882)\nnatural history, geology, evolution.\nDarwin was the fifth child and second son of Robert Waring Darwin, a successful and respected physician practicing in Shrewsbury, and Susannah Wedgwood, daughter of the potter Josiah Wedgwood I. The Darwin family was characterized by the high intellectual quality of its members, prosperity, industriousness, professional ability, and wide cultural interests.\nDarwin’s education was begun by his elder sisters after the premature death of his mother. In 1817 he was sent to a day school at Shrewsbury, where he was found to be slow at learning. In 1818 he was entered at Shrewsbury School under Dr. Samuel Butler (grandfather of the author of Erewhon). He afterwards complained he was taught nothing but classics, a little ancient history, and geography. “The school as a means of education to me was simply a blank.” This statement is perhaps unfair in that his grounding in the classics probably helped him afterwards to think so devastatingly straight. But his headmaster rebuked him publicly for wasting his time on chemical experiments, and his father upbraided him with the remark, “You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and ratcatching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.” He was removed from Shrewsbury School in 1825 and sent to Edinburgh University to study medicine.\nDarwin stayed at Edinburgh until 1827, attending courses of lectures on materia medica, pharmacy, chemistry, and anatomy, which he found unbearably dull. But worst of all were his experiences attending operations, performed perforce without anesthetics. These repelled him to such an extent that he rushed out and vowed that medicine was no career for him. The chief advantages that he gained from his stay at Edinburgh were his friendship with Robert Grant, zoologist, who accepted Lamarck’s teachings on evolution; geological excursions with Robert Jameson; and expeditions onto the Firth of Forth to collect marine animals.\nConfronted with the necessity of starting his son on a new line of endeavor, Darwin’s father sent him to Cambridge as a preparation for entering the Church of England as a clergyman. At that time, he accepted the Articles of Faith, and perfunctorily attended lectures, but his three years at Cambridge he thought “wasted as far as the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at Edinburgh and at school.” But he there made the acquaintance of Adam Sedgwick, who interested him in geology, and, most important of all, John Stevens Henslow, who fired him with a passionate interest in natural history and inspired him with a friendship that gave him confidence in himself, after his discouragement in his own family, at school, and at Edinburgh. Henslow acted as a second father to young Darwin during this critical, formative period in his life, which was climaxed by the voyage of the Beagle.\nAfter taking a poor degree at Cambridge in 1831, Darwin was at home when he received an invitation, instigated by Henslow, to join the Admiralty survey ship H. M. S. Beagle, under the command of Robert FitzRoy, as unpaid naturalist on a voyage to survey the coasts of Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, Chile, and Peru; to visit some Pacific islands; and to carry a chain of chronometrical stations around the world. Darwin wished to accept at once, but his father objected. Darwin’s uncle, Josiah Wedgwood II, thought the objection unreasonable and persuaded his brother-in-law to withdraw it. Darwin sailed on the Beagle on 27 December 1831.\nThe five years of the voyage were the most important event in Darwin’s intellectual life and in the history of biological science. Darwin sailed with no formal scientific training. He returned a hard-headed man of science, knowing the importance of evidence, almost convinced that species had not always been as they were since the creation but had undergone change. He also developed doubts of the value of the Scriptures as a trustworthy guide to the history of the earth and of man, with the result that he gradually became an agnostic. The experiences of his five years in the Beagle, how he dealt with them, and what they led to, built up into a process of epoch-making importance in the history of thought.\nOn 29 January 1839, Darwin married his first cousin, Emma Wedgwood, daughter of the Josiah Wedgwood who had saved his place in the Beagle. At first the young couple lived in London, but ill health began to attack Darwin shortly after his marriage. He found himself increasingly handicapped by great lassitude, nausea, and intestinal discomfort, which made it impossible for him to lead a normal life with social and academic contacts. The Darwins therefore moved to the country, fifteen miles from London, to Down House, in the village of Downe, in Kent. There Darwin had a garden, a small estate about which he could walk, spare rooms for the few friends who were occasionally invited to stay, a study where he could work, and peace and quiet.\nHis ill health gradually restricted him to a routine of four hours’ work a day, walks in the garden, visits to the greenhouses, occasional walks in the neighborhood or rides on a pony, interspersed with periods of rest on a sofa while reading a novel. Dinner was followed by listening to the piano and then early bed.\nAs his physicians could not discover any organic cause for Darwin’s ill health, the idea gained ground that he was a hypochondriac, and in recent years some psychiatrists have attempted to show that he was of a neurotic disposition, but the evidence is not wholly satisfactory. Following the suggestion of Saul Adler, a pathologist expert on South American infections, other commentators note that Darwin was heavily bitten in the Argentine by the Benchuca, the “black bug of the pampas,” Triatoma infestans, 70 percent of which are now reckoned to be vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas’ disease. As this trypanosome was not discovered until 1909, Darwin’s doctors would have been unable to find an organic cause for his trouble; but the clinical picture found in sufferers from Chagas’ disease matches Darwin’s symptoms in detail. The parasite invades the muscle of the heart causing lassitude; it also invades the nerve cells of Auerbach’s plexus in the wall of the intestine, upsetting peristalsis; and it invades the auricular-ventricular bundle of the heart, interference with which may cause heart block. It has unpredictable periods of latency, after which it can be recovered from blood of patients infected many years before. Darwin suffered heart attacks and died from one. Whether in addition Darwin showed neurotic tendencies, accepting the overcare which his wife bestowed on him and taking advantage of his semi-invalidism to protect himself from the distractions of society and amusement, will never be known.\nDarwin and his wife had ten children, of whom three died in infancy or childhood. The healths of the survivors (all of whom lived to ripe ages), and their launching in life, gave him anxiety. He once wrote that his chief worries were the discovery of gold in California and in Australia, “beggaring me by making my money on mortgage worthless”; the French coming by the Westerham and Sevenoaks roads, and, therefore, enclosing Down; and, third, “professions for my boys.” His fears were groundless. His investments were very profitable, Napoleon III did not invade England, and his sons made careers for themselves of which any father could be proud: Sir George Darwin, mathematician and astronomer; Sir Francis Darwin, botanist; Leonard Darwin, engineer and promoter of eugenics; and Sir Horace Darwin, scientific engineer and founder of the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co. These men, their children and grandchildren, like their father and ancestors, provide material for Galton’s theory of the inheritability of intellectual eminence.\nDarwin’s contributions to science fall into three main groups: geology, evolution and natural selection, and botany.\nDarwin as Geologist. When Darwin sailed in the Beagle, the most commonly accepted theory in geology was that of catastrophism, which held that the forces which had produced change during the past history of the earth had been on a far greater scale than any which are active today. When geologists had concluded that stratified rocks had originated as beds of sediment laid down beneath the sea, they had then been obliged to explain how the sedimentary strata had been raised up from the sea bottom to form hills and mountains, and how they had been shifted from the horizontal position, in which they must originally have been deposited, to the inclined or even vertical positions in which they are now so often found. There were two possible explanations: (1) that the sea had formerly stood at a higher level and had in fact extended over the whole earth’s surface, or (2) that the strata had been upraised and disturbed. By 1831 most geologists had rejected the idea that the sea had formerly covered the whole earth, but when they tried to imagine forces capable of raising rock strata from the bottom of the sea to form hills or ranges of mountains, it seemed to them that such changes would necessarily involve tremendous convulsions of the earth’s surface. Furthermore, they saw a link between periods of convulsion and upheaval in the history of the earth and changes in animal life. They concluded, naturally, that a convulsion of the earth’s surface tended to destroy many species of animals and that when the convulsion had subsided new species were created to replace those that had been lost.\nIn the view of the catastrophists, there had been in the history of the earth a succession of creations of animal and plant life. Each creation had survived during a period of relative tranquillity of the earth’s surface, but had later been destroyed in a catastrophic disturbance and upheaval. The history of the earth therefore included periods of tranquillity interrupted by catastrophes, and each catastrophe was followed by a new creation. The catastrophic theory of geological history was reconciled to the account of creation in the Bible by supposing that the most recent catastrophe had been the flood of Noah. Many fossil animals were therefore characterized as antediluvian, or from before the flood. Geologists also supposed that the successive creations were of a progressively higher order which culminated finally in the creation of man.\nSince the time of the flood the surface of the earth had been fixed, stable, and unchanging and the whole system of nature tranquil and orderly. The modern order of nature, catastrophists thought, was so very different from that which had existed throughout most of the history of the earth that little could be inferred of past events from present conditions.\nThe catastrophist viewpoint, firmly held by such English geologists as William Buckland, William Daniel Conybeare, and Adam Sedgwick, was challenged in 1830 by Charles Lyell in his Principles of Geology. Lyell had concluded that strata could be elevated from the bottom of the sea by the repeated action of earthquakes continued over long periods of time. In Italy and Sicily he had found recently elevated strata in the neighborhood of active volcanoes and in an area where severe earthquakes had occurred frequently throughout historic time. He showed to his own satisfaction that the strata had been elevated very gradually over an immense period of time, instead of by a single convulsion, and then went on to investigate how far the phenomena of geology might be explained by the various forces observable on the earth’s surface today. With great success he showed that the ordinary action of rain, running water, and the waves of the sea was sufficient to explain the wearing down of land and deposition of sediments, whereas the ordinary, long-continued action of volcanoes and earthquakes was sufficient to elevate continents and mountain ranges.\nWhen Darwin sailed in the Beagle, he had with him the first volume of Lyell’s Principles of Geology (1830), which he had been advised to read but on no account to believe. That is, however, exactly what Darwin did, because he satisfied himself that Lyell’s views accorded with the facts: the first step in the making of a man of science possessed of critical judgment.\nSantiago in the Cape Verde Islands provided Darwin’s first material for geological study. By applying Lyell’s principles, he quickly unraveled the history of the island. From the clear exposure of the rocks on the coast he saw that the oldest were crystalline and volcanic. Overlying them was a bed of limestone containing shells of marine organisms of Tertiary date, sixty feet above sea level and twenty feet thick. This bed, Darwin reasoned, had been deposited in a shallow sea and had since been raised to its present height; the island had undergone subsidence and then elevation. Above the limestone was more recent volcanic rock which had altered the uppermost limestone and baked it; evidence of metamorphism in situ.\nSt. Paul’s Rocks in mid-Atlantic enabled him to make acquaintance with an island which he correctly recognized as being of neither volcanic nor coralline origin; it is regarded today as an exposed portion of the mantle of the earth. But it was South America that presented itself as a model for his observational and interpretative skill. By comparing lavas of undoubted volcanic origin with igneous rocks of the Andes, he saw that they were closely related. He found that minerals in granites and in lavas were in all respects similar, and he showed a perfect graded series between crystalline granites and glasslike lavas. By observing the direction of strike and the angle of dip of strata, he found that the planes of foliation in schists and gneisses and the planes of cleavage in slates remained constant over areas stretching hundreds of miles, while their planes of inclination could vary greatly. Foliation planes and cleavage planes were parallel to the direction of the great axes along which elevation of the land had taken place. This was directly contrary to the then accepted views put forward by Sedgwick and by Lyell, and Darwin was able to prove that foliation and cleavage are not original phenomena dependent on the deposition of the strata, but had been subsequently superimposed on the beds by pressure, resulting in recrystallization in the case of foliation. He observed clay slate passing over into gneiss as it approached granite, which showed how homogeneous rocks could develop foliation by metamorphosis. Darwin’s demonstration of the origin of metamorphic rocks by deformation and of the distinction between cleavage and sedimentary bedding was a major contribution to geology.\nThe west coast of South America was an equally fruitful geological laboratory for Darwin. He was a witness to the earthquake that devastated Concepción and saw that it had resulted in an elevation of the land by several feet. He was further able to make out a connection between elevation of the land and neighboring volcanic activity because at the time when the land rose near Concepción a number of volcanoes in the Andes renewed their activity, and a new volcano beneath the sea erupted near Juan Fernandez. All these facts were shortly to be woven into an unexpected pattern.\nBy observing that the shells in beds raised to heights of as much as 1,300 feet belonged to species still living, and in proportions of species similar to those in the ocean, Darwin was able to prove, as Lyell had in Sicily, that such elevation was recent. In the Andes, at a height of 7,000 feet, he found a fossil forest of trees in situ (i. e., not drifted from elsewhere) because their trunks projected several feet perpendicularly from the stratum in which they were embedded, which was itself overlaid by thousands of feet of sedimentary deposits alternating with volcanic lavas. This showed that the trees had been buried thousands of feet beneath sea level as the deposits accumulated, and had since been raised to their present height. Here was proof of extensive subsidence as well as elevation.\nBeds containing shells that had been raised up were far fewer and much less extensive than low-lying beds, and Darwin found that this was due to the erosion that constantly attacks land surfaces and destroys deposits. This fact had a bearing on estimations of the age of the earth, because while the time taken for a deposit to be formed can be roughly gauged, it is impossible to tell how long an interval of time has gone by while the beds were eroded. This means that the nonconformities between geological formations may represent much longer periods of time than the formation of the beds themselves, and that the age of the earth must be vastly greater than was then imagined.\nFrom these findings, Darwin was led to consider what are the most favorable conditions for the accumulation of beds many thousands of feet thick containing fossils, such as are found elsewhere. He concluded that it could only have been when a slow subsidence continually lowered the bottom of a shallow sea, so that the depth of that sea below sea level remained fairly constant. These conditions further imply that such a sea was near to continental land, from which erosion brought down the material spread out in the deposits. Proof of this was obtained in observation of beds south of Valparaiso, 800 feet thick, containing shells of animals which when alive lived in shallow water, not more than 100 feet deep. The lowest beds of the deposit must have lain 700 feet higher than at present when the first shells became embedded, and as subsidence started the deposits continued and kept pace with the drop of 700 feet. Another bed showed evidence of the same process involving a subsidence and deposits of 6,000 feet. The various conditions required for such accumulations of fossils can only have been met occasionally and at particular localities in the history of the earth, from which it follows that the fossil record must be expected to be erratic and incomplete.\nAnother line of study to which Darwin was led by his expeditions in the Andes was the change in climate which regions must have undergone, both in geological time and during the life of man. This followed from observation of deserted houses, abandoned by Indians, up to the snowline in places now quite uninhabitable because of lack of water and fertility. This connection between geological phenomena and life was further developed in his studies of coral reefs.\nWhile in South American waters, Darwin had never seen a coral reef, but he knew that atolls in their myriads all over the oceans are about at sea level, and that the coral polyps which build them can live only in waters less than 120 feet deep and at temperatures above 20°C. The theory of the origin of atolls, or lagoon islands, developed by Lyell, was that they were formed on the rims of submarine volcanic craters. Darwin quickly saw that such a hypothesis was untenable, and he put forward his own deductively. There must have been a foundation for the corals at a depth not exceeding 120 feet. It cannot be imagined that there were innumerable submarine mountain ranges with their summits all exactly at this height; therefore, they must have been brought to the required level by subsidence, and he found evidence for it in drowned villages in the Caroline Islands. This has since been confirmed by deep borings at Funafuti, at Bikini, and at Eniwetok, where evidence has been found of over 4,600 feet of coral rock produced by shallow-water organisms during prolonged subsidence.\nIn addition to atolls or lagoon-islands, there are also barrier reefs, like the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, which is known to have been erected by coral polyps on the down-faulted coastal edge of northeast Australia. Darwin observed a third type of coral reef, the fringing reefs or shore-reefs that surround an island which projects high above the sea, and these reefs are often found lifted above sea level. Fringing reefs are therefore the result of coral action on platforms that are either stationary or have undergone elevation. With all this evidence, Darwin drew a map. He found that large zones of the Pacific Ocean have atolls and barrier reefs and have undergone subsidence, while other zones, parallel to these, have fringing reefs and have undergone elevation. Now the most extraordinary correlation with these facts, bearing in mind Darwin’s observations of the connection between land elevation and volcanic activity, was the distribution of active volcanoes in the Pacific: all of them are situated in the zone of fringing reefs, not one of them in the zone of atolls or barrier reefs. Darwin’s book on Coral Reefs, published in 1842, still remains the accepted explanation, except for a slight addition in the form of R. A. Daly’s glacial control theory. This is based on the fact that during the recent Ice Ages, the amount of water immobilized in icecaps reduced the level of the oceans by 150 feet, which would have exposed the atolls to the air and cut down their height by wave-action. But when the Ice Age came to an end and the sea level rose again, the platforms were there for coral polyps to make new atolls.\nThe evidence which Darwin obtained in South America and in atolls for changes of sea level was later responsible for leading him into error. In 1838 in attempting to explain the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy in Scotland, Darwin imagined that the land had sunk by over 1,000 feet and that the so-called roads were marine beaches. In 1862 it was shown by T. F. Jamieson that the glaciers of Ben Nevis had dammed back the waters of a lake, the level of which dropped twice as outlets were formed, and that the roads were lake beaches. Darwin admitted defeat in words which have an important message for all scientific research workers: “How rash it is in science to argue because any case is not one thing, it must be some second thing, which happens to be known to the writer…. My error has been a good lesson to me never to trust in science to the principle of exclusion”.\nDarwin’s trilogy of geological books was completed by the publication in 1844 of Volcanic Island, and at the end of 1846 by Geological Observations on South America. The supremacy of the position which geology occupied in Darwin’s mind shortly after his return from the voyage of the Beagle is shown by the order of subjects in the title of the first edition, published in August 1839, of his Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the Various Countries Visited by H. M. S. Beagle. In the second edition, published in August 1845, natural history and geology have changed places. The reason for this is to be found in the progressive orientation of Darwin’s mind toward the problem of evolution.\nEvolution and Natural Selection. When Darwin sailed in the Beagle, he had no reason to call in question the accepted view that the species of plants and animals alive on earth were as they had always been since the creation. It was only gradually that doubts began. They arose from four kinds of evidence. The first was that in some areas species had become extinct. Darwin himself had found gigantic fossil armadillos (and other forms) in South America; but armadillos of similar but not identical form also live in South America. This meant that “extinct animals have a close relation in form with extinct species.” Why was this?\nSecond, in adjacent areas of South America, Darwin found one species replaced by different, although very similar, species. On the pampas he observed and collected specimens of the South American ostrich (rhea), but when he went farther south into Patagonia, he found a very similar but smaller species (Rhea darwinii). But why were the two species of rheas built on the same plan, different from that of the African ostriches? Why were the agoutis and vizcachas of South America built on the same plan as other South American rodents and not on that of North American or European hares and rabbits?\nThe third doubt was evoked by the fact that inhabitants of oceanic islands tended to resemble species found in the neighboring continents; African-like species in the Cape Verde Islands, South American-like species in the Galápagos archipelago. At the same time, although the geological and physical features of the Cape Verde and Galápagos Islands are very similar, their faunas are quite different. Why was this?\nFinally, the different Galápagos islands, identical in climate and physical features, and very close to each other, might be expected to have identical species, but they had not. On different islands he observed that the finches characteristic of the Galápagos group differed in structure and food habits. Some ate insects, others ate seeds, and their sizes and their bills differed in relation to their diets and mode of life. Darwin suspected that they were only varieties of a single species. The local inhabitants could also tell at sight from which island any of the giant tortoises had come. Was all this arbitrary and meaningless or could a pattern of meaning be discerned?\nThe answer gradually came to Darwin: All these questions, and many more, could be rationally answered if species did not remain immutable but changed into other species, and diverged, so that one species could have given rise to two or more. It is because they had a common ancestor in South America that fossil armadillos resemble living armadillos, that agoutis resemble capybaras, and that the Galápagos birds resemble South American birds, while the Cape Verde birds resemble African birds with which in each case they had a common ancestor. But why did the finches and other birds of each Galápagos island differ from one another? “One might really fancy that, from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends,” Darwin wrote. These “ends” are very important; they fit the animals for their mode of life, they are adaptations; and the isolation of each species on each island plays an important part.\nGradually, only a few months after his return to England, these ideas began to crystallize in Darwin’s mind: “Animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all netted together.”\nIn July 1837 Darwin started writing down his ideas at random in his Notebook on Transmutation of Species. He soon found that if change of species had occurred, there was a ready explanation for a number of otherwise arbitrary and inexplicable facts. Why are the bones of the arm of a man, the foreleg of a dog and a horse, the wing of a bat, and the flipper of a seal built on the same general plan, with the different bones corresponding, each to each? Why are young embryos of lizards, chicks, and rabbits so similar to each other, while their adults are so distinct? Why do some animals have useless rudiments of organs? Why do particular regions of the earth have their characteristic plants and animals? Why do organisms fall into groups, namely, species, that may be arranged in larger groups, namely, genera, that in turn may be arranged in still larger groups, namely, families, and so on? Why is there this apparent relationship of species instead of a random distribution of forms across the whole field of possibilities? Why do more or less similar organisms behave in similar ways? For instance, why do both horses and men yawn; why do both orangutans and men show emotional distress by weeping? Why do fossils in early geological formations differ greatly from those living today, while those from more recent formations differ only slightly?\nAll these questions could be meaningfully answered if species were related by descent from common ancesters, but not otherwise. It is important to note Darwin’s form of argument. He never claimed to demonstrate the change of one species into another, and in his letters constantly repeated that he was tired of impressing this fact on his readers and critics; all that he claimed was that if evolution has occurred, it explains a host of otherwise inexplicable facts. But after he had satisfied himself that evolution had occurred, he kept his views to himself because he saw the great obstacles that lay ahead. Evolution he already saw as the change that species undergo in relation to their adaptation to their environment. A woodpecker differs from other birds in that it has two claws of its feet directed backward, with which it secures a firm grasp on the trunk of a tree, stiff tail feathers with which it supports itself against the tree, a stout bill with which it chisels a hole in the bark, and a very long tongue which it projects through the chiseled hole to extract the grubs beneath the bark. The woodpecker must have evolved these adaptations. How?\nIn considering this question of how evolution might have occurred, Darwin noticed that the cultivation of plants and the domestication and breeding of animals, both of which man has practiced since the Neolithic period, were the result of selection. Man deliberately chose the parents of the next generation of his plants and animals, to perpetuate and improve the qualities in them which he required. But how did, or could, selection operate in nature, where there had been no man to direct it, since the beginning of life on earth? Darwin had already observed that some species are better adapted than others to life in particular environments, and thus are likely to leave more descendants, while the less well adapted may diminish and become extinct (Notebook 1, MS. p. 37, notebook finished in February 1838). In other words, he had already grasped the principle of natural selection before he saw how it was enforced in nature.\nThe solution to this problem came to him on 28 September 1838 when he read Thomas Robert Malthus’ Essay on the Principle of Population. Malthus, whose whole line of thought was tinged with opposition to the principles of egalitarianism displayed by the French Revolution, argued that since the potential rate of increase in man was geometrical, and that his population could double in twenty-five years, while the increase of available foodstuffs could not increase so fast, there was bound to be misery, poverty, starvation, and death among the poor unless the rate of population increase in man was checked by war, famine, disease, or voluntary restraint (which would diminish the incentive to work among the poor).\nMalthus, therefore, demonstrated the relentless pressure which human populations, by their boundless tendency to grow, maintain on their requirements for life whatever the level of their resources may be. If the food supply and other requirements for life can be increased, a population will tend to grow until its growth presses against the limits of the enlarged supply of food. Malthus also observed that in many countries the population did not grow and much of his book is taken up with a study of the means by which the numbers of people were limited in different countries. These ranged from exposure of infants, infanticide, and the intermittent reduction of the population by famine in China, to delayed marriage and strict sexual morality in Norway. But Malthus was able to show that in every country the tendency of a human population to grow was under some form of severe and continued restraint.\nDarwin pounced on the argument and applied it, not to man, but to plants and animals in nature, and saw that they are in no position to increase their food supplies, but must die if they outstrip them by their own numbers. Here were the sanctions that made natural selection work.\nLike most flashes of genius, it was very simple, and T. H. Huxley said later, “How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.” It marked a turning point, not only in the history of science, but in the history of ideas in general, for there is no field of human intellectual endeavor that has not been influenced by the thought and fact of evolution. By good fortune, the note that Darwin scribbled down immediately when the flash struck him has been preserved. It is of such importance that it deserves quotation:\n28th [September 1838] We ought to be far from wondering of changes in numbers of species, from small changes in nature of locality. Even the energetic language of De Candolle does not convey the warring of species as inference from Malthus. Increase of brutes must be prevented solely by positive checks, excepting that famine may stop desire. In Nature production does not increase, whilst no check prevail, but the positive check of famine and consequently death. I do not doubt every one till he thinks deeply has assumed that increase of animals exactly proportionate to the number that can live.\nPopulation is increase at geometrical ratio in FAR SHORTER time than 25 years, yet until the one sentence of Malthus no one clearly perceived the great check amongst men. There is [a] spring, like food used for other purposes as wheat for making brandy. Even a few years plenty makes population in man increase and an ordinun crop causes a dearth. Take Europe, on an average every species must have same number killed year with year by hawks, by cold etc. even one species of hawk decreasing in number must affect instantaneously all the rest. The final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, and adapt it to changes, to do that for form which Malthus shows is the final effect (by means however of volition) of this populousness on the energy of man. One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying to force every kind of adapted structure into the gaps in the oeconomy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones.\nThis passage, in which Darwin’s thought penetrates through a jungle of ideas, following on his reading of Candolle’s description of the war of nature and Malthus’ book, is remarkable for a number of reasons. In the first place it pinpoints the notion that evolution does not take place in a vacuum, but each individual, if it is lucky, lodges in its fortified position in the economy of nature, in what is now called its ecological niche, in dynamic equilibrium not only with the physical factors of the environment, but with the other living organisms of the habitat. It is because Darwin recognized this fact so clearly that he can be reckoned as the founder of the science of ecology.\nSecond, this passage shows that evolution is not a process that goes on in single individuals, or even in Paris, but which proceeds in populations and consists of some individuals becoming better adapted, under the pressure of natural selection, which is the third lesson of this passage. Ernst Mayr has pointed out that one of the most important recent advances in biology has been the realization that the real units are populations, which have objective existence, and not types (which are only imaginary abstractions), and that Darwin was more responsible than anyone else for the substitution of “population-thinking” for “typological thinking.” The change to a different species is nothing but a by-product of the process of a species becoming better adapted, after a certain point of divergence has been reached. The explanation of the fact of divergence itself is foreshadowed in the passage. As Darwin later wrote, “The more diversified the descendants of any one species become in structure, constitution and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature.” Again, it is the ecological niches which supply the key to the problem.\nDarwin’s argument can be formulated as follows: (1) The numbers of individuals in species in nature remain more or less constant. (2) There is an enormous overproduction of pollen, seeds, eggs, larvae. (3) Therefore, there must be high mortality. (4) All individuals in a species are not identical, but show variation and differ from one another in innumerable anatomical, physiological, and behavioristic respects. (5) Therefore, some will be better adapted than others to their conditions of life and to the ecological niches which they could occupy, will survive more frequently in the competition for existence, will leave more off-spring, and will contribute most of the parents that will produce the next generation. (6) Hereditary resemblance between parents and offspring is a fact. (7) Therefore, successive generations will not only maintain but improve their degree of adaptation to their modes of life, i.e., to the conditions of their environments, and as these conditions vary in different places, successive generations will not only come to differ from their parents, but also from each other and give rise to divergent stocks issuing from common ancestors.\nThis is the formal theory of evolution by natural selection, which recent observation and controlled experiment have proved to be correct in all cases. What modern biology has done is to provide answers to the two questions which, in the state of knowledge of his time, Darwin could not answer: what is the nature of hereditary transmission between parents (and grandparents, and so forth) and offspring? And what is the nature of the origin of heritable variation? Without heritable variation, natural selection could achieve nothing. In Darwin’s day, no clear distinction was made between what was heritable and what was not, and few doubted the inheritance of characters acquired by a parent during its own life.\nThe problem was completely solved (unknown to Darwin, or to the world before 1900) by Gregor Mendel, who proved that the basis of inheritance takes the form of particulate characters, distributed between parents and offspring in accordance with a simple law (since proved by cytology and the behavior of chromosomes) known as Mendel’s law of segregation. The inception of a heritable novelty was a sport, now known as a mutation, a random, nonadaptive change in the chemical structure of a particular character, now known as a gene. The application of Mendelian genetics to Darwinian selection was effected by the work of J. B. S. Haldane and Sir Ronald Fisher by 1930. Since then the synthetic theory of evolution by natural selection has been generally accepted by biologists. It is remarkable that even without the knowledge that these advances represent, to say nothing of those achieved in comparative biochemistry, serology, parasitology, and cytogenetics, Darwin was nevertheless able to construct a coherent theory which made general acceptance of evolution possible—and a mechanism to account for it, namely, natural selection. Although long considered inadequate, natural selection is now proved to be the basis for biological change and for the production of all the diverse structures and functions of living organisms.\nShortly before Darwin died, his son Leonard asked him how long he thought that it would be before positive evidence of natural selection would be forthcoming. Darwin replied, about fifty years. It was a remarkably accurate forecast, for it was in the 1930’s that Sir Ronald Fisher showed how expression of a gene, in the form of the bodily character that it controls, is itself the effect of selection. Shortly afterward, E. B. Ford demonstrated that mimetic resemblance in butterflies is adaptive, confers survival value, and originates from heritable variation. The researches of H. B. D. Kettlewell on industrial melanism in moths, P. M. Sheppard and A. J. Cain in snails, T. Dobzhansky on geographical races of fruit flies, and A. C. Allison on sickle cell in man have provided experimental evidence not only of natural selection but of the pressure at which it works, and have permitted actuarial estimates of the longevity of different genetic types. This follows the mathematical studies of Sir Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright, and J. B. S. Haldane on the effects of selection at different intensities on the composition of populations.\nStudies on what B. Rensch has called “ring-races” has shown species in the act of splitting into new species, in gulls, tits, and salamanders, when geographical isolation of portions of populations enables them to evolve independently of each other, so that they become adapted in different directions and eventually no longer interbreed. This speciation is what T. H. Huxley regarded as necessary for the final confirmation of Darwin’s views.\nPaleontology has been a trap for biologists and others who have neglected David Hume’s warning that the existence of a state of affairs does not in itself justify conclusions on how it came about.\nDarwin claimed that the fossil record, as known to him, was compatible with evolution; but that if fossils ever provided any evidence contrary to his theory, such, for instance, as to prove that the Cambrian fossils were the first organisms that ever lived, or that a mammal was “created” later than those earliest known mammals of the Stonesfield Slate of the Jurassic period, his theory of evolution must be abandoned. However, he never adduced any evidence from fossils to bear on the problem of the principle of natural selection.\nAlthough the recognition of fossils as former living beings goes back four centuries, it is only recently that paleontology has come into its own as a science, largely as a result of the researches of George G. Simpson. Fully aware that the mechanism of evolution can be interpreted only in terms of genetics, ecology, selection, and population studies, Simpson has shown that evolutionary sequences previously claimed as “straight” are not straight at all. For example, the evolutionary history of the horse has followed a zigzag course, first in the direction of many-toed browsers on leaves, then in that of many-toed grazers on grass, and finally in that of one-toed grazers on grass. In general the horse increased in size, but some species became smaller. Each lap of the course can be correlated with the environmental conditions of the period: soft or hard ground, leafy or grassy (siliceous) vegetation. At all times the trend has been toward favorable adaptations, to ecological niches which paleontologists are now in a position to describe; in other words, it has been compatible with the requirements of natural selection and has been opportunistic and devoid of any predetermined program. Furthermore, the rate of evolution, now measurable by radioactive dating, is not correlated with variability, nor with fertility (years per generation). In this manner, Simpson has been able to show that natural selection under changing environmental conditions accounts for evolution, and explains why in terrestrial forms evolution has generally been rapid, while in marine forms it has been slow or stationary.\nIt is regrettable that Darwin in later years allowed himself to be persuaded to accept Herbert Spencer’s inappropriate expression “survival of the fittest.” This stresses survival when the important thing is the greater fecundity of the better adapted; it emphasizes a superlative “fittest” when it is the slightest comparative superiority of adaptation that confers advantage. It lays the subject open to the taunt of tautology: Who survive? The fittest. Which are the fittest? Those who survive. This is a form of argument which neglects entirely the fundamental fact that forms better adapted to their environment leave more offspring. Finally, the phrase conveys no inkling that the automatic choice exerted by nature in ramming the better adapted variants into their ecological niches is the efficient cause of adaptation. It was not the first (or last) time that so-called philosophers of science have encumbered scientists with their help.\nAfter Darwin had developed his new theory of the origin of species by natural selection in 1838, he did not publish it, or even discuss it with his friends. In 1842 he drew up a rough sketch of his argument, which in 1844 he expanded into an essay but never published. In 1845 when he had finished preparing for publication the results of his geological work on the Beagle voyage, he put the species question aside and started on eight tedious years’ study of the structure and classification of living and fossil barnacles. In the course of this work he acquired firsthand knowledge of the amount of variation that is found in nature, and he also made a striking discovery, that of complemental males, small parasitic males found under the mantle of larger hermaphrodite or female individuals.\nAfter his return to England in 1836 Darwin became close friends with Charles Lyell and Joseph Dalton Hooker. They did not accept evolution, which was known to them only in the form of Lamarck’s exposition. Lamarck’s views were in many ways similar to those of Erasmus Darwin, who posited that there was a “natural tendency” to perfection, and the “inner a feelings” of an animal caused it to provide the organs required to meet its needs. In 1844 Robert Chambers published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, which only brought the subject into disrepute by its amateurish ignorance.\nIn April 1856 Darwin described his theory of natural selection to Lyell, who urged him to write a book describing his views on species. He began the work in the summer of 1856. On 18 June 1858 Darwin received a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace containing a perfect summary of the views which he had worked out during the preceding twenty years. Thanks to Lyell and to Hooker, Darwin’s and Wallace’s papers were read together before the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858 and published on 20 August of that year.\nDarwin then set about writing an “abstract” of his larger work, and On the Origin of Species was published on 24 November 1859. The fat was then in the fire. Old-fashioned biologists protested that Darwin indulged in hypotheses that he could not prove (and he did not pretend to prove them). Theologians were aghast at two consequences of Darwin’s work; the first was that man and the apes must have had a common ancestor, which dislodged man from his privileged position as created by God in his own image. The second arose from the consideration that if Darwin’s views on the origins of plants and animals, including man, by natural selection were true, then much of the argument for the existence of God based on the presence of design in nature was destroyed. The theologian William Paley had argued that highly specialized and coordinated adaptations, such as the tongue, beak, claws, and tail of the woodpecker, or the human hand, manifested a complex design which required one to postulate the presence of a designer in nature. If, however, these same adaptations could be accounted for by natural selection acting on random variations, a designer was no longer needed. Since natural theology, as represented by Paley, had enjoyed enormous influence in England, the destruction of its very foundations was greeted with dismay and outrage.\nMatters came to a head at the celebrated Oxford meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science on 30 June 1860, when the Reverend Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford (who knew little of natural history but was coached by the anatomist Richard Owen, who was jealous at what he felt already was Darwin’s ascendancy over himself), twitted Darwin’s friend Thomas Henry Huxley with the question whether it was through his father or his mother that he claimed descent from an ape. Huxley replied that he was not ashamed to be descended from an ape but he would be ashamed of an ancestor who used great gifts and eloquence in the service of falsehood. Wilberforce was annihilated by Huxley and Hooker, and Darwin’s views on evolution started their conquest of the world. In the United States, Darwin’s friend, the botanist Asa Gray, had already won a victory over the anatomist and paleontologist Louis Agassiz, who was never able to accept Darwin’s theory.\nAfter the Origin of Species, Darwin wrote three more books expanding different aspects of the work. The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication (1868) took up in detail that subject which had been confined to one chapter of the Origin. It contained his hypothesis of pangenesis, by means of which Darwin tried to frame an explanation of hereditary resemblance, inheritance of acquired characters, atavism, and regeneration. It was a brave attempt to account for a number of phenomena which were beyond the bounds of scientific knowledge in his day, such as fertilization by the union of sperm with egg, the mechanism of chromosomal inheritance, and the development of the embryo by successive cell division. His hypothesis of pangenesis could not therefore give a permanently acceptable account of the multitude of phenomena it was designed to explain. It was, however, a point of departure for particulate theories of inheritance in the later nineteenth century.\nDarwin’s next book, The Descent of Man (1871), filled in what was only adumbrated in the Origin. T. H. Huxley and W. H. Flower had shown already that the body of man differs less from that of an ape than the latter does from that of a monkey. It is important to remember that Darwin never claimed that man was descended from apes, but that man’s ancestor, if alive today, would be classified among the Primates, and would be even lower in the scale than the apes. Man and apes are subject to similar psychological and physiological processes in courtship, reproduction, menstruation, gestation, birth, lactation, and childhood. At early stages of embryonic development the human fetus has a tail, inherited from ancestors who not only had a tail as embryos but also as adults and were quadrupedal. Darwin wrote, “The time will before long come when it will be thought wonderful, that naturalists, who were well acquainted with the comparative structure and development of man and other animals, should have believed that each was the work of a separate act of creation.”\nHaving proved his point with man’s body, Darwin then turned to the most difficult aspect, man’s mind. Here he showed that the gap, however enormous between man and the highest animal, is not unbridgeable, by the principle of gradation. Man shares with animals the urge to self-preservation, sexual love, maternal affection, paternal protection, and the senses of pleasure, pain, courage, pride, shame, excitement, boredom, wonder, curiosity, imitation, attention, and memory. As for the moral sense, Darwin concluded that it, also, arose gradually, through evolution, and that any animal endowed with social instincts, which man’s ancestors undoubtedly possessed, would acquire a moral sense as soon as its intellectual powers had developed (by natural selection) to an extent comparable with those of man and was able to appreciate the survival value of collaboration and mutual affection. Borrowing from Marcus Aurelius the view that social instincts are the prime principles of man’s moral constitution, Darwin concluded that these, with the aid of intellectual powers and the effects of new tradition and habits, would lead naturally to the Golden Rule: “As ye would that men should do to you, do ye to them likewise.”\nIn this book Darwin added an essay on a related subject: sexual selection, the preferential chances of mating that some individuals of one sex (usually the male) have over their rivals because of special structures, colors, and types of behavior used in courtship displays, leading them to leave more offspring and accentuate their characters: for example, antlers in deer, trains in peacocks, feathers in birds of paradise, color in sticklebacks. There is no need to assume a power of aesthetic choice in either sex; the characters act as sexual stimulants, real aphrodisiacs, so that mating follows more quickly, occurs more often, and there are more progeny. In man, there can be no doubt that the differences between the sexes in respect of distribution of hair on face and body and of fat in local accumulations under the skin are the result of sexual selection.\nDarwin did not explain how the preference of females for particular structures, colors, and courtship displays was related to natural selection, although female preferences themselves must be subject to natural selection. Perhaps Darwin’s greatest contribution in this area was to show that secondary sexual characteristics had evolved in relation to a complex pattern of reproductive behavior, which must itself be the product of natural selection.\nThe last of Darwin’s books in this series, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), contains studies of facial muscles and means of expression in man and mammals, emission of sounds, erection of hair, and so forth, and their correlation with suffering, sobbing, anxiety, grief, despair, joy, love, devotion, reflection, meditation, sulking, hatred, anger, pride, disdain, shame, surprise, fear, horror, acceptance (affirmation), and rejection (negation). With this book Darwin founded the study of ethology (animal behavior) and conveyance of information (communication theory) and made a major contribution to psychology.\nBotanical Works. From the first Darwin interested himself in adaptations of plants to cross-pollination. He found that trees (with countless flowers) tend to have flowers of one sex, while small plants have hermaphrodite flowers, and he showed that the unisexuality of trees would tend to prevent self-pollination. He concluded that “flowers are adapted to be crossed, at least occasionally, by pollen from a different plant.” Here was a general principle which must have a wide meaning, and he set out to study it. His attention was first directed to orchids, which have elaborate adaptations for cross-pollination, making the bees that visit their flowers carry away the pollen sacs with them and pollinate the next flowers that they visit. His book on the Fertilization of Orchids (1862) showed that plants are in no way behind animals in the marvels of the adaptations that they show. Darwin further observed that flowers that are pollinated by wind have no colors; it is only those that are pollinated by insects that have bright colors in their petals and sweet-smelling nectaries.\nPresently Darwin noticed that in some species flowers differ by the lengths of their anthers and styles, like the primroses, which show two conditions, or loosestrife, which shows three. This is also an adaptation for cross-pollination, and these observations formed the basis of Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species (1877). The problem continued to fascinate him, and he raised two large beds of seedlings of Linaria vuglaris, the one cross-pollinated and the other self-pollinated, all from the same plant. “To my surprise, the crossed plants when fully grown were plainly taller and more vigorous than the self-fertilized ones.” Darwin had experimentally discovered and demonstrated the fact of hybrid vigor, or heterosis, which is completely explained by Mendelian genetics. These experiments, conducted over twelve years on fifty-seven species, led to the publication of Effects of Cross and Self Fertilization (1876). The demonstration of the advantage that accrues from cross-fertilization explains not only why sexual reproduction (as distinct from asexual budding) increases heritable variation (through recombination of genes), but also reveals the basis for the survival value conferred by the existence of different sexes in a species. This adaptation (for that is what it is) is a very old one, for it was inherited by plants and animals before they diverged from one another.\nDarwin’s interest in climbing plants was not that of a systematic botanist but an attempt to discover what adaptive value the habit of climbing has. He found that “climbing” is a result of the process of nutation; the apex of the plant’s stem bends to one side while it grows and the plane of the bend itself revolves, clockwise or counterclockwise, so that the apex describes circular sweeping movements. In the hop plant—in hot weather, during daylight hours—it takes a little over two hours for each revolution. If the growing stem hits nothing, it continues to circle; if it hits an object it wraps itself around it by twining, Twining thus enables a young and feeble plant, in one season, to raise its growing point and leaves much higher from the ground, with more exposure to sunlight and air, without expending time and energy in the synthesis of woody supporting tissues. There is a further delicate adaptation here; a twining plant will not twine around an object larger than approximately six inches in diameter. This adaptation prevents it from climbing up a large tree, where it would be deprived of air and sun by the tree’s own leaves.\nSome plants climb by a modification of this method and have stalks and leaves that clasp other objects, and intermediate forms show that leaf-climbers evolved from twiners. In others, such as the Virginia creeper, the leaf tendrils end in little discs full of resinous fluid which anchor the plant to its support. These researches were described in Climbing Plants (1875).\nThe behavior of climbing plants and the bending of their shoots led Darwin to investigate the mechanical cause of such bending. The fact that a stem bends toward the light because it grows faster on the unilluminated than on the illuminated side of the stem had been known for some time. By means of simple but ingenious experiments, Darwin showed that the tip of the shoot was sensitive to light and that the bending was caused by growth of the stem on the side away from the light but some way down from the apex. Furthermore, this growth was due to a substance that comes down from the apex, “some matter in the upper part which is acted upon by light, and which transmits its effects to the lower part.” From these researches and experiments (reported in Power of Movement in Plants, 1880) has sprung the whole science of growth hormones in plants.\nDarwin’s chance observation of the number of flies caught on the leaf of the common sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) was the starting point for a series of observations and experiments which showed not only how insects are caught, but how their bodies are digested and ingested, and what the significance of this carnivorous habit is for the life of the plant. By feeding one bed of sundew plants with meat and depriving another bed, he found that the fed plants had larger leaves, taller flowerstalks, and more numerous seed capsules. This remarkable adaptation, which insures survival of the plants, explains why sundew plants, which have very few roots, through which only small supplies of nitrogen can be obtained, can live on extremely poor soil. Darwin was particularly impressed by the fact that the living cells of plants possess a capacity for irritability and response similar to that of the nerve and muscle cells of animals. His work on Insectivorous Plants was published in 1875.\nDarwin’s last book connected with plants was The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms (1881). This was published only six months before his death but covers a subject that he had studied for more than fifty years. He showed the services performed by earthworms in eating leaves and grinding earth in their gizzards and turning it into fertile soil, which they constantly sift and turn over down to a depth of twenty inches from the surface, thereby aerating it. He calculated from the weight of worm-castings that on one acre in one year’s time eighteen tons of soil are brought up to the surface by worms. This was a pioneer study in quantitative ecology.\nDarwin was elected to fellowship of the Royal Society in 1839 at the age of twenty-nine; three foreign universities awarded him honorary doctorates; and fifty-seven leading foreign learned societies elected him to honorary or corresponding membership—the French Academy of Sciences only in 1878, for his views have never been really appreciated in France. The Prussian government awarded him the highly coveted Ordre pour le mérite, but from the British sovereign and the British government he never received any recognition. His demonstration of the fact of evolution, and of the automatic mechanism of natural selection which causes it, was unpalatable to the orthodox views of the Church of England. When he died, however, twenty members of Parliament asked the dean of Westminster to allow his burial in Westminster Abbey, an honor which was readily granted. Darwin himself would have been highly amused, for, with his genial sense of humor he once said, “Considering how fiercely I have been attacked by the orthodox, it seems ludicrous that I once intended to be a clergyman.” At his funeral there were present not only his friends Hooker, Huxley, and Wallace, but also James Russell Lowell, the American ambassador, as well as diplomats representing France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Russia.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nI.

For the original article on Darwin see DSB, vol. 3 (note error in date of birth given there).\nWhen Gavin de Beer wrote the article on Darwin in the original DSB there were only a handful of historical studies available, including his own biography. Over the next few decades there was an explosion of interest in the process by which Darwin developed his theory of evolution by natural selection, fueled by the publication of his notebooks, edited by de Beer himself. There have also been many studies of the impact of Darwin’s ideas, inspired in part by a recognition that earlier perceptions had been shaped by the success of the selection theory in the mid-twentieth century. Michael Ruse coined the term “Darwin industry” to denote the group of historians who devoted themselves to the study of his work. Many of Darwin’s papers have since been published, including a combined volume of the notebooks originally edited by de Beer. There are editions of his diaries, of the marginalia he scribbled in the books he read, and an ongoing project to publish his whole correspondence. Both the Origin of Species and the notebooks have been provided with a concordance. The flow of technical literature has slackened off, but the flood of biographical studies has continued unabated, those by Janet Browne and by Adrian Desmond and James Moore having attracted particular attention.\nThere have been important developments in the understanding of many aspects of Darwin’s work and its implications. Historians such as Jonathan Hodge have alerted scholars to the strong thread that runs through Darwin’s work based on a traditional view of heredity and reproduction. There have been major debates on the role of ideology in his thinking and new developments in the understanding of his changing religious views. De Beer’s effort to trace a straightforward link between Darwin’s original theory and modern Darwinism have come under suspicion as researchers have become more aware of the existence of alternative ideas about how evolution might work.\nDarwin’s Early Career . Darwin’s period of medical study at Edinburgh has traditionally been dismissed as of little significance. But he also worked on natural history there, and this has led Hodge and Phillip R. Sloan to challenge the impression given in his autobiography that these were wasted years. Darwin claimed to have been unimpressed by the Lamarckian anatomist Robert Grant, although it is now known that the two worked closely together, and that Darwin was impressed by Grant’s claim that the “zoophytes” (Hydrozoa and corals) serve as a bridge between the plant and animal kingdoms. Darwin’s early reading focused his attention on issues that would shape his later thinking, especially his ideas about generation or sexual reproduction. He became committed to the view that reproduction is a creative activity of the vital forces in the body, a position quite unlike the modern focus on the rigid transmission of genetic units. Here his thinking reflects the fascination with the creativity of sex that ran through his grandfather Erasmus Darwin’s theories.\nSandra Herbert has made a major study of Darwin’s geological work and has shown how he turned the methodology of Charles Lyell into a theoretical program for understanding all Earth movements. There have been important studies of Darwin’s biogeographical work on the Beagle voyage. Working on Darwin’s original notes, Frank Sulloway has undermined the myth of a “eureka” experience on the Galápagos Islands by showing that the finches there could not have played such a crucial role. Darwin’s own specimens were not even labeled to show which island they were collected on, and he had to rely on collections made by others on the ship to reconstruct the distribution. Only after his return to England, when the ornithologist John Gould informed him that the finches really did constitute a group of distinct but closely related species, did Darwin realize their full significance.\nHerbert and Martin Rudwick have made detailed studies of Darwin’s active role in the London geological community following his return, including his abortive theory on the parallel roads of Glen Roy. But behind the scenes he had begun to think hard about the question of transmutation. Sulloway argues that the insights that led Darwin to the idea of branching evolution were probably arrived at after the Beagle had returned to England in October 1836, although a few historians speculate that he may have accepted transmutation during the later part of the voyage. Ernst Mayr called this the first Darwinian revolution: The Galápagos results convinced him that new species are formed by the natural transformation of old ones, although as yet he had no idea what the process of change might be. Over the next few years he searched for a plausible mechanism, and his development of the theory of natural selection constitutes a second revolution.\nThe Discovery of Natural Selection . Howard Gruber has explored Darwin’s notebooks from this period to argue that the discovery of the selection theory can be seen as a major example of creative thinking. Darwin sometimes projected an image of himself as a patient observer, and his opponents have always accused him of being incapable of deep thought. But he also said that the Origin was “one long argument,” and Mayr among others has stressed that he was anything but a simple fact-gatherer. Ruse and Silvan Schweber focus on Darwin’s desire to appear a good scientist as defined by contemporary discussions of the scientific method by Sir John Frederick William Herschel and William Whewell. They argue that he developed natural selection by a creative process of synthesis and testing. David J. Depew and Bruce H. Weber see the selection theory as the product of a new statistical mode of explanation and also stress his innovative work in the area of methodology. Darwin wanted to create a theory based on natural law in the Newtonian tradition, but by the very nature of the problems he addressed he was forced to transform this program by introducing statistical and historical elements into his explanations. Robert J. Richards sees the historical element as derived from German idealist philosophy, but others, including Hodge, relate it to Lyell’s uniformitarian methodology.\nDarwin started from his knowledge of biogeography, and with a conviction that evolution must be a branching process in which one species is divided by geographical barriers and the separate populations then become transformed in different directions. He wondered if species might be “born” with a built-in lifespan, after which they become extinct. He soon realized, however, that some more active mechanism of change was needed and by July 1837 he was convinced that transmutation must come about by the accumulation of individual variations over many generations. He explored the direction already taken by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and Erasmus Darwin: Might a change in the environment produce modifications either by affecting the reproductive process or by changing the organisms’ habits? He soon decided that Lamarckism was inadequate. For a variety of reasons, he decided that although the environment might well be the stimulus, the majority of the changes it produced were not purposeful.\nStudies by Hodge, David Kohn, and Phillip Sloan have revealed the extent to which Darwin was influenced by his views on “generation” or reproduction. The key to transmutation was the creative power of sexual reproduction. The theory of heredity he later called “pangenesis” (published in 1868) was formulated at this early stage. Older studies lament Darwin’s “failure” to anticipate genetics, on the assumption that if he had developed the concept of the gene he would have avoided the problems that beset the selection theory in the late nineteenth century. Modern scholars accept that the foundations of his thought lie in a premodern concept of heredity.\nJames Secord and Peter J. Vorzimmer show how the C notebook shows Darwin studying work of animal breeders, where changes could actually be observed within a species. He later suggested that he observed the breeders applying a process of artificial selection and then saw how this model could be transferred to natural evolution. L. T. (Lloyd Thomas) Evans and Ruse have explored the analogy between artificial and natural selection because—as Darwin himself later realized—it offers such a neat model for how natural selection operates. But although the process of selection seems clearly illustrated in such cases, Darwin’s notebooks show that there was no direct borrowing of the selection model from the breeders. Throughout the C and D notebooks he remained convinced that adaptive variations must somehow be elicited automatically in a changed environment (Lamarckism), and did not see the breeders work as a useful analogy. Accounts of the discovery of the selection mechanism by Camille Limoges, Herbert, and Richard A. Richards have argued that he could not have been inspired by the model of artificial selection. Darwin became so used to citing the work of animal breeders as a model in his later accounts of the theory that he actually came to believe that this was how he was led to the idea of selection.\nAt this point he read Thomas Robert Malthus on population and realized the significance of the struggle for existence. Here the discussion enters the debate over the extent to which his thinking reflected the ideology of free-enterprise capitalism. Robert M. Young has been the most powerful advocate of the view that the selection theory does reflect the prevailing ideology of the time, a position backed up in the biography by Desmond and Moore. Schweber argues for an influence derived from the individualism of Adam Smith’s economics, while noting that scientific factors had already begun to make Darwin think in terms of individual variation within a population—the innovation that Mayr calls “population thinking”—the transition from seeing a species as based on an ideal type to seeing it as a population of distinct individuals. Depew and Weber see the rise of Darwinism as the creation of a statistical mode of explanation as opposed to the old Newtonian view of causation based on law. The claim for a direct input from Darwin’s social environment must be balanced against the evidence for a growing awareness that for science to tackle certain kinds of questions, a new type of explanation based on statistically modeled changes was needed.\nDe Beer’s account minimized the influence of Malthus, treating the population principle as only a catalyst helping Darwin to put together insights already gained from his observations of nature. The connection is certainly not as direct as is sometimes implied: Peter J. Bowler showed that Darwin’s concept of the struggle for existence does not appear in Malthus’s work, and in this sense he had to think creatively with the insight provided by the population principle. Malthus did not anticipate the logic of what became known as social Darwinism, and thus could not provide the whole model for the selection theory. Edward Manier and Schweber point to the breadth of Darwin’s reading, which reveals other ways in which the ideology of the time could have filtered into his thinking. He read Smith and also David Brewster’s review of Auguste Comte’s positivist philosophy, which argued for the need to base all theories on mathematical foundations—exactly what was provided by the arithmetical logic of the population principle. Looking for a way of measuring variation, he turned to the work of the Belgian anthropologist Lambert Quételet, who pioneered the application of statistics to the human population. Darwin’s theory was not a slavish copy of Malthus’s political philosophy, but it may nevertheless have been steeped in the ideology of the time. As Desmond and Moore stress, this was a time of social conflict in Britain, so Darwin could see on the streets the struggle that the political economists were trying to understand.\nStudies by Gruber and Herbert show the M and N notebooks revealing Darwin’s adoption of a materialist perspective, at least on how his theory would apply to humankind. These notes anticipate many of the topics later articulated in the Descent of Man. Darwin saw no room for the traditional notion of a soul existing on a purely spiritual plane: The mind was a product of the material activity of the brain, just as the phrenologists held. He suspected that much of human unconscious behavior may be instinctive, programmed into human brains by the effect of evolution on humanity’s ancestors. The ways in which individuals express their emotions reveal their animal ancestry, as in the case of snarling to express anger. He was convinced that evolution would throw light on moral values by showing how certain forms of social behavior have been programmed into humans by natural selection. Morality was merely a rationalization of these social instincts. Such ideas would undermine the whole traditional view of human nature.\nYet Darwin still felt that the laws of nature were instituted by a wise and perhaps even benevolent God. Far from recognizing the full horror of a worldview based on struggle, he stressed that the end result of evolution was to keep species well adapted to their environments in an ever-changing world. As Walter Cannon and Young argue, he transformed rather than destroyed the old natural\ntheology of William Paley (1743–1805). Even struggle and death had a positive value in the divine plan. Robert Richards argues that Darwin was also committed to the idea of progress. He suggests that historians influenced by modern Darwinism have failed to appreciate that Darwin still saw evolution as a steady pressure to mount the scale of organization. Selection was a force that would tend to raise the standard of organization whenever the circumstances were appropriate. But he was also aware that the advance could take place in a number of directions, not just along a single line leading toward humanity.\nDevelopment of the Theory . Over the next twenty years Darwin worked on his theory, soon moving to live in the countryside at Downe. He was not a complete recluse, however, and the vast extent of the correspondence network he built up (later published) provided him with sources of information on subjects relevant to his theorizing. As Manier argues, he was trying to build up a community of scientists who would speak the new language of evolution.\nDarwin’s work on barnacles provided him with many insights, including the importance of embryological characters for determining relationships. His thinking incorporated an element of what would later be called the recapitulation theory, although the extent to which he can be associated with the full-blown version of this theory is controversial. Richards has argued that Darwin adopted the “law of parallelism,” whose influence had been charted by Stephen Jay Gould. This form of recapitulation theory implies a linear model of evolution, with the lower animals being treated as immature versions of the more perfect human form. Many historians are suspicious of Richards’s effort to tie Darwin in with the developmental way of thinking so prevalent in Germany.\nAn important change took place in Darwin’s thinking in the 1850s. It has often been assumed that as soon as he formulated the selection theory, he must have recognized that it implied a much harsher vision of nature as a scene of unrelenting struggle and suffering. But Dov Ospovat argued that the early form of the theory still revealed its roots in Paley’s vision of natural theology. Only in the 1850s did he realize that a compromise could not be maintained. The principle of population implies that the struggle for existence continues even in a stable environment, so there can never be any escape from the relentless threat of death. As Frank Burch Brown, Kohn, and Neal Gillespie show, Darwin’s worldview thus became gradually more pessimistic. Moore notes how this move was encouraged by the death of his beloved daughter Anne in 1851.\nOspovat also notes that this growing recognition of the power of struggle allowed Darwin to explain the trends toward divergence and specialization being discovered by Richard Owen in the fossil record. Both Owen and William B. Carpenter recognized this trend by comparing the fossil sequences with the process of embryological specialization observed by Karl Ernst von Baer. In effect, Darwin applied the principle of the “division of labor” to explain why it was advantageous for species to diversify. Browne and Kohn note that biogeography also transformed Darwin’s thinking on this issue. His “principle of divergence” arose from a recognition that successful genera expand and diversify, wiping out the species that had previously occupied the territory. Here again Darwin came face to face with the relentless pressure of natural selection. Sulloway notes that by focusing on the pressure to specialize, Darwin was led to marginalize his early emphasis on the role of geographical isolation in speciation, as in the Galápagos. Nevertheless, by 1856 he had created a much more sophisticated theory and had amassed a vast amount of supportive evidence and had begun to write a “big book” on the topic, now published and edited by Robert Stauffer. This was the project interrupted by the arrival of Alfred Russel Wallace’s paper in 1858. There has been much debate over the degree of similarity between the two men’s theories of natural selection, summarized by Malcolm Kottler. Some scholars argue that there were significant differences between them, but no one disputes that Darwin recognized important parallels and began writing the Origin of Species.\nThe Reception of Darwin’s Theory . Surveying the recent work on the reception of the Origin of Species moves into broader realms of the interactions between Darwin and the scientific, cultural, and social developments of the time. A survey of the Darwinian revolution by Ruse provides a useful overview, as do the biographies of Darwin by Browne and Desmond and Moore. Recent studies of the early Darwinians such as Thomas Henry Huxley should also be consulted.\nFor the scientific debate, David Hull edited and commented on a collection of reviews of the Origin. Scholars such as Vorzimmer, Jean Gayon, and William Provine have traced the debates over natural selection from Darwin’s time into the era of modern genetics. The emergence of the so-called modern synthesis of Darwinism and genetics was the topic of an important collection of essays edited by Mayr and Provine. Here is a complex series of debates centered on challenges to the traditional assumption that Darwin’s “failure” to recognize the significance of Gregor Mendel’s laws of heredity left him vulnerable to attacks such as the one launched by Fleeming Jenkin in 1867. In the early 2000s, recognition of the role played by a pregenetical model of heredity and variation in Darwin’s thinking about selection makes it difficult to imagine how he could have appreciated the potential value of Mendelism. Nor is it clear that his theory of pangenesis necessarily undermined the credibility of the selection mechanism, although Jenkin’s attack did force him to question his longstanding assumption that favorable variations were very rare. The process by which the theory of natural selection was synthesized with genetics was long and complex because it involved the destruction of a developmental viewpoint in which the transmission of characters was thought to be inextricably connected with the mechanism by which those characters are generated in the embryo.\nMany modern historians would accept that it was the prevalence of this developmental model in late nineteenth-century biology, not a specific problem associated with “blending inheritance” that accounts for the widespread reluctance to take the theory of natural selection seriously during Darwin’s own lifetime. Peter Bowler has outlined several alternative theories of evolution developed in the late nineteenth-century “eclipse of Darwinism.” In particular he develops Gould’s account of the ways in which the recapitulation theory was used to imply that evolution must be directed along predefined channels, just like the development of the embryo. Bowler has also suggested that an appreciation of the extent to which Darwin’s own explanation of the process was rejected must force us to reconsider the reasons why the basic idea of evolution became popular at the time. Darwinism was translated into a theory of necessary progress, and the more radical implications of the selection theory remained dormant until the twentieth century. Along similar lines, Ruse has written a provocative book arguing that Darwinism succeeded only because the theory of evolution piggybacked on the rising tide of enthusiasm for the idea of progress.\nIn terms of the wider public response, Alvar Ellegard provided a detailed study of the reaction to Darwin in the British periodical press. Gillian Beer has pioneered the study of Darwin’s influence in the literary sphere. Moore has challenged the established view that evolutionism became sucked into a “war” between science and religion, noting the extent to which liberal Christians welcomed the theory because they saw it as a model for social progress in the modern world. The challenges posed by this vision to the more traditional Christian view of the origin of humanity were highlighted in Darwin’s own study of human origins, the Descent of Man. Richards has written a detailed account of the development of evolutionary explanations of the human mind, which compares Darwin’s ideas on the topic with those of other thinkers such as Herbert Spencer. He stresses the extent to which Darwin and Spencer saw themselves as providing morality with a new foundation, certainly not as destroying all traditional values. Darwin did, however, come to accept the prevailing view that the nonwhite races retain more traces of humanity’s ape ancestry, although initially he had adopted more liberal views on this issue.\nCuriously, however, there have been comparatively few attempts to integrate Darwin’s ideas on human origins with the history of paleoanthropology, although a survey by Bowler stresses the innovative nature of his belief that the development of an upright posture was the key breakthrough in the separation of the first hominids from the apes. Virtually all other commentators before the mid-twentieth century took it for granted that it was the expansion of the human brain that drove the separation— Darwin was the first to suggest that the initial step might have been triggered by an adaptive change necessitated by the hominids’ move onto the open plains.\nThere have been endless debates about the role played by Darwin’s theory in the promotion of “social Darwinism.” Historians such as Young, who stress the ideological input into Darwin’s own thinking, have naturally pointed to the use of Darwinian rhetoric to justify policies in which struggle is the driving force of progress. There have been many accounts of social Darwinism making the same point, from the classic study by Richard Hofstadter to more recent work by Mike Hawkins. But historians such as Robert Bannister and Bowler have urged caution, noting that some appeals to the metaphor of the struggle for existence did not depend on the application of the selection theory, even when Darwin’s name was invoked. Spencer’s enthusiasm for individual competition was linked to a Lamarckian mechanism of self-improvement, for all that he coined the term “survival of the fittest.”\nThere have been comparatively few accounts of the detailed biological investigations Darwin carried out in the later part of his life, apart from those contained in the biographies. Helena Cronin and Kottler have written on the theory of sexual selection, especially Darwin’s longstanding debate with Wallace on the topic (significantly in the context of the “eclipse” of Darwinism; few other biologists took that theory seriously until the mid-twentieth century). On a more personal level, Ralph Colp has written on Darwin’s illness. Moore has discredited the story, popular among modern creationists, that he underwent a deathbed conversion back to Christianity. Moore has also provided an analysis of the symbolism associated with the events surrounding his funeral. When he died in 1882 the scientific community was anxious to exploit his status as the most famous biologist of the century to obtain for him the honor of being buried in Westminster Abbey.\nSUPPLEMENTARY BIBLIOGRAPHY\nThere have been many modern editions of The Origin of Species, usually based on either the first or the sixth editions, and translations into most major languages.\nWORKS BY DARWIN\nCharles Darwin’s Natural Selection: Being the Second Part of His Big Species Book Written from 1856 to 1858.

Bowler\nEncyclopedia of Science and Religion\nCOPYRIGHT 2003 The Gale Group Inc.\nDarwin, Charles\nAuthor of the Origin of Species (1859) and the Descent of Man (1871), Charles Darwin (1809–1882) famously challenged the popular belief that every species had been separately and immediately created by divine fiat. His theory of evolution by natural selection was based on what he considered an empirical fact: the presence of variation among members of every species. Darwin's powerful argument was that, in competition for limited resources, those variants having characteristics that favored them in their struggle would tend to be preserved and produce more offspring than those less advantaged. Over many generations the gradual accumulation of advantageous variations would lead to the emergence of a new species markedly different from its progenitor. Applied to humankind the argument was particularly contentious for the continuity it affirmed between animals and humans, and because the idea of species transformation was often associated with political radicalism and materialism. Darwin himself recalled that admitting the mutability of species had been like confessing to murder.\nProviding a naturalistic account of species production and then of human evolution, Darwin risked offending the piety of those, including his own wife Emma Wedgwood, who wished to give the moral sense a transcendental significance. If humans had evolved from humbler species could humans be said to be made in the image of God ? Was it possible to speak of an immortal soul? What remained of the argument for design, which in Christian natural theology had often presupposed the perfect adaptation of organic structures to the needs of the organism that possessed them?\nDarwin was not the atheist vilified in ultraconservative religious literature, but he did become increasingly agnostic. Attacked in the name of religious orthodoxy, he found it \"ludicrous\" that he had once intended to become a clergyman. This was a reference to his Cambridge education, which had followed an abortive preparation in Edinburgh for a medical career. At Cambridge, the young Darwin encountered divines such as John Henslow and Adam Sedgwick who combined scientific enthusiasm with reverence for nature as a work of creation. In Edinburgh he had moved in free-thinking circles and had been introduced to the evolutionary theory of the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Darwin also knew that his grandfather Erasmus Darwin had proposed organic transformation, but Charles Darwin was not yet a convert to such ideas. On leaving Cambridge his destiny would be to find ways of explaining the appearance of design in such intricate mechanisms as the human eye without recourse to the divine \"Contriver\" celebrated by the theologian and philosopher William Paley in his Natural Theology (1802).\nDarwin's research\nThis destiny was shaped by a five-year voyage on which Darwin embarked in December 1831 as companion to Robert Fitzroy, captain of HMS Beagle. The ship was sailing for South America , enabling Darwin to enlarge his horizons as a naturalist and geologist. Having been captivated by the travelogues of Alexander von Humboldt he soon luxuriated in the rain forests of Brazil . As Adrian Desmond and James Moore have observed, their sublimity afforded a surrogate religious experience: \"twiners entwining twiners, beautiful lepidoptera, silence, hosanna\" (p. 122). Thoughts of a Christian ministry gradually receded as Darwin was enchanted by the study of nature, delighted by the discovery of fossil bones, staggered by the number of species that had become extinct. He was intrigued by resemblances between lost and living forms, by tantalizing patterns in the distribution of flora and fauna, and by disruptive natural forces. Entering the city of Concepción in Chile he found the cathedral shattered by an earthquake. At the Southern tip of South America natives of the Tierra del Fuego were struggling to survive in one of the most inhospitable regions on Earth . The world was perhaps not the \"happy world\" of Paley's English garden. Even before reading economist Thomas Malthus's Essay on Population in September 1838, Darwin had been \"well prepared\" to appreciate the struggle for existence that Malthus's arithmetic on reproductive fecundity convinced him was inexorable.\nOf his visit to the Galapagos Islands it is often said that Darwin recognized that each island had its own distinctive species, eventually concluding that the different finches, for example, had diverged from a mainland ancestor, molded by nature to occupy different niches. But there was no such \"Eureka\" moment. Darwin had muddled his finch specimens from various islands and it was not until March 1837, following his return to England , that the ornithologist John Gould broke the exciting news that three forms of mockingbird, from different islands, were genuinely different species. Gould identified fourteen species of finch from Darwin's specimens. The enthralling question was why so many similar species lived in such proximity, but Darwin was unable to prove that the geographical isolation of each island had been responsible for the proliferation.\nDarwin's earliest speculations on evolutionary change preceded his reading of Malthus. They show him playing with the idea that nature employs bisexual reproduction as a way of introducing variation into each new generation, so permitting continuing adaptation to changing conditions of existence. Darwin flirted with, but quickly rejected, the possibility of sudden mutation as a source of evolutionary change. As with the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace later, it was when reading Malthus that the penny finally dropped and a theory of natural selection took shape.\nThe metaphor of \"natural selection\" allowed Darwin to exploit a simple analogy. Domestic animals and birds showed a degree of plasticity as breeders chose which specimens to mate when selecting for characteristics they wished to accentuate. Darwin crossed social barriers in fraternizing with pigeon fanciers and he emphasized the diversity of form ultimately derived from the common rock pigeon. Even a trained ornithologist, he argued, would be tempted to think that the pouter, runt, and fantail were not merely different varieties but different species. If, through human \"selection,\" such effects could be produced, might not nature achieve much more in the millions of years at its disposal? For insight into the age of the Earth and for an emphasis on the incompleteness of the fossil record, which would help him to explain the absence of transitional forms in the fossil record, Darwin was indebted to the geologist Charles Lyell.\nDarwin's view of religion\nDid the metaphor of \"selection\" imply a divine selector in the management of the evolutionary process? Some of Darwin's contemporaries believed so. Darwin's own emphasis, however, was on the interplay of unconscious forces. Without denying a creator on whom the existence of everything ultimately depended, Darwin rejected the kind of deity who might be micromanaging the process. Rejecting the argument for design as formulated by Paley, Darwin's extension of natural law to explain how new species had arisen did not preclude a transcendent legislator. In his first transmutation notebook, he wrote of a \"Creator who creates through laws,\" one who had \"impressed\" certain laws on nature, as a consequence of which beautiful organic forms had evolved. Darwin resembled earlier deists, admitting the existence of a creator but doubting there had been divine revelation or intervention\nIn certain respects his science corroded a residual faith. The more people know of the fixed laws of nature, he wrote in his Autobiography, \"the more incredible do miracles become\" (p. 86). As his wife recognized, the questioning mentality demanded of a scientist could induce skepticism. Debating the question whether evolution was under divine control, Darwin stressed the elements of randomness in the process. His conclusion was that the variations on which natural selection worked appeared without a prospective use in mind. The presence of so much pain and suffering also affected Darwin deeply. This was difficult to square with belief in a beneficent deity, but was consistent with his hypothesis of natural selection and with what in the first full sketch of his theory (1842) he called the \"concealed war of nature.\"\nTo ascribe Darwin's agnosticism to his science would, however, be simplistic. During the Beagle voyage he was already asking himself whether an intuitive sense of God was universal among humankind, concluding it was absent among Fuegians and native Australians. Some Christian teaching he found morally repugnant. Aware of high moral standards among the freethinkers he met in the circle of the English writer and social reformer Harriet Martineau, he declared in his Autobiography that the idea of eternal damnation for those outside the fold was a \"damnable doctrine\" (p. 87). Although opinions differ as to when he finally renounced Christianity , the death early in 1851 of his young daughter Annie produced a crisis in which belief in a beneficent God became unsustainable. His agnosticism was to be peculiar since he retained the conviction that the universe as a whole could not be the result of chance. But so nuanced was his thinking that he came to mistrust his own conviction. If the human mind was itself the product of evolution, what guarantee was there that it could be trusted when engaging such metaphysical issues?\nReligious responses to Darwin's science\nReligious responses to Darwin's science have varied enormously. From 1859 until the 1930s, when a powerful new synthesis of genetics and Darwinian theory appeared, the controversial status of natural selection left plenty of scope for supplementary or alternative mechanisms for evolution in which divine control was affirmed. Strictly speaking, as the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley insisted, Darwinism had no implications for the central tenets of theism. Huxley even conceded that it was still possible to assert design in an original cosmic state from which all had developed through natural processes. Modern atheists and materialists, by contrast, frequently stress the apparently directionless aspects of biological evolution, weaving them into a completely secular and naturalistic world view.\nWithin the Christian churches the theory of evolution, not surprisingly, continues to be a divisive issue compounding the problems posed by historical criticism of the Bible . In some religious communities it has become the symbol of secular and liberalizing values and is still vehemently resisted. Yet religious writers have also appropriated Darwin's theory for constructive purposes, as did one of Darwin's early converts, Charles Kingsley, who concluded that a deity who could make all things make themselves exhibited greater wisdom than one who simply made things. Might a unified process of evolution testify more eloquently to a single creator than piecemeal creation? Darwin's American correspondent Asa Gray, a botanist, even suggested the theory might assist the theologians with their greatest difficulty—the problem of suffering. If competition and struggle were the prerequisites of a creative process, without them there could not have been the evolutionary development that had culminated in human intelligence and responsiveness. Darwin himself had toyed with the idea that a deity who had created the possibility for humans to evolve might be considered less directly responsible for the uglier facets of nature that had also been possible in such a world. Sophisticated theologians have invoked the Darwinian theory to illuminate what they see as God's self-limitation rather than coercive agency. Others have seen in evolution evidence of divine immanence and participation in the world. It was the view of nineteenth-century Oxford theologian Aubrey Moore that, under the guise of a foe, Darwin had done the work of a friend, destroying infantile images of a conjuring god who was inactive except when intervening.\nSee also Creationism; Creation Science; Deism; Design; Design Argument; Divine Action; Evolution; Evolution, Biocultural; Evolution, Biological; Evolution, Human; Evolution, Theology of; Genetics; Immanence; Intelligent Design; Revelation; Scopes Trial\nBibliography\nbowler, peter. reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century britain. chicago: university of chicago press, 2001.\nbrowne, janet. charles darwin : voyaging. london: pimlico. 1995.\nburkhardt, frederick, ed. the correspondence of charles darwin. cambridge, uk: cambridge university press, 1985.\ndarwin, charles. the autobiography of charles darwin (1876), ed. nora barlow. london: collins, 1958.\ndarwin, charles. the descent of man (1871). amherst, n.y.: prometheus, 1997.\ndarwin, charles. on the origin of species by means of natural selection (1859). new york: bantam, 1999.\ndawkins, richard. the blind watchmaker. london and new york: penguin, 1986.\ndawkins, richard. climbing mount improbable. london and new york: penguin, 1996.\ndesmond, adrian, and moore, james. darwin. london: michael joseph, 1991.\ndurant, john, ed. darwinism and divinity: essays on evolution and religious belief. oxford: blackwell, 1985.\nhaught, john. god after darwin: a theology of evolution. boulder, colo.: westview press, 2000.\nhodge, jonathan, and radick, gregory, eds. the cambridge companion to darwin. cambridge, uk: cambridge university press, 2002.\nkohn, david, ed. the darwinian heritage. princeton, n.j.: princeton university press, 1985.\nkohn, david. \"darwin's ambiguity: the secularization of biological meaning.\" british journal for the history of science 22 (1989): 215–239.\nlarson, edward. evolution's workshop: god and science on the galapagos islands. london and new york: penguin, 2001.\nlivingstone, david. darwin's forgotten defenders: the encounter between evangelical theology and evolutionary thought. grand rapids, mich.: eerdmans, 1987.\nmoore, james. the post darwinian controversies: a study of the protestant struggle to come to terms with darwin in great britain and america, 1870–1900. cambridge, uk: cambridge university press, 1979.\nnumbers, ronald. the creationists. new york: knopf, 1992.\nroberts, jon. darwinism and the divine in america: protestant intellectuals and organic evolution 1859–1900. madison: university of wisconsin press, 1988.\nruse, michael. can a darwinian be a christian? the relationship between science and religion. cambridge, uk: cambridge university press, 2001.\nward, keith. god, chance, and necessity. oxford: one world, 1996.\njohn hedley brooke\nCOPYRIGHT 2004 The Gale Group Inc.\nCharles Robert Darwin\nThe English naturalist Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882) discovered that natural selection was the agent for the transmutation of organisms during evolution, as did Alfred Russel Wallace independently. Darwin presented his theory in \"Origin of Species.\"\nThe concept of evolution by descent dates at least from classical Greek philosophers. In the 18th century Carl Linnaeus postulated limited mutability of species by descent and hybridization. Charles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, and the Chevalier de Lamarck were the chief proponents of evolution about 1800. Such advocacy had little impact on the majority of naturalists, concerned to identify species, the stability of which was considered essential for their work. Natural theology regarded the perfection of adaptation between structure and mode of life in organisms as evidence for a beneficent, all-seeing, all-planning Creator. Organic structure, planned in advance for a preordained niche, was unchanged from the moment of creation. Variations in structure in these earthly imperfect versions of the Creator's idea were minor and impermanent.\nIn 1815 William Smith had demonstrated a sequence of fossil populations in time. Charles Lyell, adopting James Hutton's uniformitarian view that present conditions and processes were clues to the past history of the earth, wrote his Principles of Geology (1830-1833), which Darwin on his Beagle circumnavigation found most apt for his own geological observations. Fossils in South America and apparent anomalies of animal distribution triggered the task for Darwin of assembling a vast range of material. A reading of Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population in 1838 completed Darwin's conceptual scheme.\nCritics, for whom the Origin is paramount among Darwin's considerable output, have accused him of vacillation and procrastination. But recent study of unpublished manuscripts and his entire works reveal a continuity of purpose and integrity of effort to establish the high probability of the genetic relationship through descent in all forms of life. Man is dethroned as the summit of creation and as the especial concern of the Creator. This revolution in thought has had an effect on every kind of human activity.\nDarwin was born on Feb. 12, 1809, at Shrewsbury, the fifth child of Robert and Susannah Darwin. His mother, who was the daughter of the famous potter Josiah Wedgwood, died when Charles was 8, and he was reared by his sisters. At the age of 9 Charles entered Shrewsbury School. His record was not outstanding, but he did learn to use English with precision and to delight in Shakespeare and Milton.\nIn 1825 Darwin went to Edinburgh University to study medicine. He found anatomy and materia medica dull and surgery unendurable. In 1828 he entered Christ's College, Cambridge, with the idea of taking Anglican orders. He  attended John Stevens Henslow's course in botany, started a collection of beetles that became famous, and read widely. William Paley's Natural Theology (1802) delighted Darwin by its clear logical presentation, and he later regarded this study as the most worthwhile benefit from Cambridge. He received his bachelor's degree in 1831.\nVoyage of the Beagle\nOn Henslow's recommendation Darwin was offered the position of naturalist for the second voyage of H. M. S. Beagle to survey the coast of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego and complete observations of longitude by circumnavigation with a formidable array of chronometers. The Beagle left on Dec. 27, 1831, and returned on Oct. 2, 1836. During the voyage Darwin spent 535 days at sea and roughly 1200 on land. Enough identification of strata could be done on the spot, but sufficiently accurate identification of living organisms required systematists accessible only in London and Paris.\nDarwin kept his field observations in notebooks with the specimens listed serially and their place and time of collection documented. On July 24, 1834, he wrote: \"My notes are becoming bulky. I have about 600 small quarto pages full; about half of this is Geology the other imperfect descriptions of animals; with the latter I make it a rule to describe those parts which cannot be seen in specimens in spirits. I keep my private Journal distinct from the above.\" Toward the end of the voyage, when sea passages were long, he copied his notes and arranged them to accord with systematics, concentrating on range and habits. Geology was prepared with fewer inhibitions; he wrote from Mauritius in April 1836: \"It is a rare piece of good fortune for me that of the many errant (in ships) Naturalists there have been few, or rather no, Geologists. I shall enter the field unopposed.\"\nDuring the trip Darwin discovered the relevance of Lyell's uniformitarian views to the structure of St. Jago (Cape Verde Islands). He found that small locally living forms closely resembled large terrestrial fossil mammals embedded between marine shell layers and that the local sea was populated with living occupants of similar shells. He also observed the overlapping distribution on the continuous Patagonian plain of two closely related but distinct species of ostrich. An excursion along the Santa Cruz river revealed a section of strata across South America. He observed the differences between species of birds and animals on the Galápagos Islands.\nPublications Resulting from Voyage\nDarwin's Journal of Researches was published in 1839. With the help of a government grant toward the cost of the illustrations, the Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle was published, in five quarto volumes, from 1839 to 1843. Specialist systematists wrote on fossil and living mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles. Darwin edited the work and contributed habits and ranges of the animals and geological notes on the fossils. Two themes run through his valuable and mostly neglected notes: distribution in space and time and observations of behavior as an aid to species diagnosis. He also published The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs (1842); he had studied the coral reefs in the Cocos Islands during the Beagle voyage.\nDarwin abandoned the idea of fixity of species in 1837 while writing his Journal. A second edition, in 1845, had a stronger tinge of transmutation, but there was still no public avowal of the new faith. This delightful volume is his most popular and accessible work.\nDarwin's Transmutation (Species) Notebooks (1837-1839) have recently been reconstructed. The notion of \"selection owing to struggle\" derived from his reading of Malthus in 1838. Earlier Darwin had read Pyrame de Candolle's works on plant geography, so his mind was receptive. The breadth of interest and profusion of hypotheses characteristic of Darwin, who could carry several topics in his mind at the same time, inform the whole. From this medley of facts allegedly assembled on Baconian principles all his later works derive.\nIt was not until Darwin's geological observations of South America were published in 1846 that he started a paper on his \"first Cirripede,\" a shell-boring aberrant barnacle, no bigger than a pin's head, he had found at Chonos Island in 1835. This was watched while living, then dissected, and drawn while the Beagle sheltered from a week of severe storms. The working out of the relationship to other barnacles forced him to study all barnacles, a task that occupied him until 1854 and resulted in two volumes on living forms and two on fossil forms.\nDarwin married Emma Wedgwood, his first cousin, in 1839. They lived in London until 1842, when ill health drove him to Down House, where he passed the rest of his life in seclusion. Four of their sons became prominent scientists: George was an astronomer and mathematician, Francis a botanist, Leonard a eugenist, and Horace a civil engineer.\nDevelopment of Ideas on Evolution\nIn 1842 and 1844 Darwin wrote short accounts of his transmutation views. The 1844 sketch in corrected fair copy was a testament accompanied by a letter to his wife to secure publication should he die. Late in 1844 Robert Chambers's Vestiges of Creation appeared advocating universal development by descent. A great scandal ensued, and criticism of the amateur pretensions of the author was savage. Darwin decided to bide his time and become more proficient as a biologist.\nIn 1855 Darwin began to study the practices of poultry and pigeon fanciers and worldwide domesticated breeds, conducted experiments on plant and animal variation and its hereditary transmission, and worried about the problem of plant and animal transport across land and water barriers, for he was persuaded of the importance of isolation for speciation. The last step in his conceptual scheme had already occurred to him in 1852 while pondering Henri Milne-Edwards's concept of diversification into specialized organs for separation of physiological functions in higher organisms and the relevance of these considerations for classification when related to the facts of embryological development. Darwin's \"principle of divergence\" recognizes  that the dominant species must make more effective use of the territory it invades than a competing species and accordingly it becomes adapted to more diversified environments.\nIn May 1856 Lyell heard of Darwin's transmutation hypothesis and urged him to write an account with full references. Darwin sent the chapter on distribution to Lyell and Sir Joseph Hooker, who were deeply impressed. Darwin continued his writing, and on June 14, 1858, when he was halfway through, he received an essay from Alfred Russel Wallace containing the theory of evolution by natural selection—the same theory Darwin was working on. Lyell and Hooker arranged for a reading of a joint paper by Wallace and Darwin, and it was presented at a meeting of the Linnaean Society on July 1. The paper had little effect.\nOrigin of Species\nOn Nov. 24, 1859, Darwin published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. The analogy of natural selection was prone to misunderstanding by readers, since it carried for them an implied purpose on the part of a \"deified\" Nature. Herbert Spencer's phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was equally misleading because the essence of Darwin's theory is that, unlike natural theology, adaptation must not be too perfect and rigid. A mutable store of variation must be available to any viable population in nature.\nThe publication of Darwin's book secured worldwide attention for his hypothesis and aroused impassioned controversy. His main champion was T. H. Huxley. Darwin, remote in his retreat at Down House, took painstaking note of criticism and endeavored to answer points of detail in the five more editions of Origin produced during his lifetime. He avoided trouble and made several unfortunate concessions which weakened his presentation and made his views seem vague and hesitant. The first edition is easily the best.\nLater Works\nIn On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects (1862) Darwin showed how the welfare of an organism may be hidden in apparently unimportant peculiarities. It became hard to say what is \"useless\" in nature. His The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication (1868; rev. ed. 1875) expanded on a topic he had introduced in Origin. A chapter in Origin on man as the most domesticated of animals grew into the book The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871). The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872) developed from material squeezed out of the Descent.\nPlants became an increasing preoccupation, the more so since Darwin had his son Francis as collaborator and amanuensis. Papers Darwin had published in 1864 were collected into The Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants (1875), and these ideas were further generalized on uniformitarian lines and published as The Power of Movement in Plants (1880). All plants, not merely climbing ones, were shown to execute to some degree exploratory \"circumnutation\" movements. Studies on fertilization of plants by insects recorded as early as 1840 led to The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom (1876) and The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species (1877). Insectivorous Plants (1873) pursued the reactions of plants to stimuli. Darwin's last work returned to observations he had made in 1837: The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations on Their Habits (1881). He died on April 19, 1882, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\nFurther Reading\nPrimary sources on Darwin include The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, edited by Francis Darwin (3 vols., 1887), which has an autobiographical chapter; More Letters of Charles Darwin, edited by Francis Darwin and A. C. Seward (1903); and his Autobiography, edited with appendix and notes by his granddaughter, Nora Barlow (1958; repr. 1969). An excellent, nontechnical account of Darwin's life and work is Sir Gavin de Beer, Charles Darwin: Evolution by Natural Selection (1964). Other biographical studies are Paul B. Sears, Charles Darwin: The Naturalist as a Cultural Force (1950), and Gerhard Wichler, Charles Darwin: The Founder of the Theory of Evolution and Natural Selection (1961). Gertrude Himmelfarb, Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution (1959), offers a provocative reinterpretation of the man and his impact.\nA dramatic pictorial account of Darwin's trip around the world in the Beagle is Alan Moorehead, Darwin and the Beagle (1969), which incorporates excerpts from Darwin's autobiography, journal, and letters. Parts of Darwin's work are examined in P. R. Bell, ed., Darwin's Biological Work: Some Aspects Reconsidered (1959), and Darwin's vast influence is assessed in Michael T. Ghiselin, The Triumph of the Darwinian Method (1969). A good, succinct presentation of the essence of Darwin's ideas is Benjamin Farrington, What Darwin Really Said (1967), which can serve as a review of the major problems raised by Darwin's theories. □\nCite this article\nWorld of Microbiology and Immunology\nCOPYRIGHT 2003 The Gale Group Inc.\nDarwin, Charles Robert (1809-1882)\nEnglish naturalist\nCharles Robert Darwin is credited with popularizing the concept of organic evolution by means of natural selection . Though Darwin was not the first naturalist to propose a model of biological evolution, his introduction of the mechanism of the \"survival of the fittest,\" and discussion of the evolution of humans, marked a revolution in both science and natural philosophy.\nDarwin was born in Shrewsbury, England and showed an early interest in the natural sciences, especially geology. His father, Robert Darwin, a wealthy physician, encouraged Charles to pursue studies in medicine at the University of Edinburg. Darwin soon tired of the subject, and his father sent him to Cambridge to prepare for a career in the clergy. At Cambridge, Darwin rekindled his passion for the natural sciences, often devoting more time to socializing with Cambridge scientists than to his clerical studies. With guidance from his cousin, entomologist William Darwin Fox (1805–1880), Darwin became increasingly involved in the growing circle of natural scientists at Cambridge. ox introduced Darwin to clergyman and biologist John Stevens Henslow (1796–1861). Henslow became Darwin's tutor in mathematics and theology, as well as his mentor in his personal studies of botany, geology, and zoology. Henslow profoundly influenced Darwin, and it was he who encouraged Darwin to delay seeking an appointment in the Church of England in favor of joining an expedition team and venturing overseas. After graduation, Darwin agreed to an unpaid position as naturalist aboard the H.M.S. Beagle. The expedition team was initially chartered for a three year voyage and survey of South America 's Pacific coastline, but the ship pursued other ventures after their work was complete and Darwin remained part of H.M.S. Beagle' s crew for five years.\nDarwin used his years aboard the Beagle to further his study of the natural sciences. In South America, Darwin became fascinated with geology. He paid close attention to changes in the land brought about by earthquakes and volcanoes. His observations led him to reject catastrophism (a theory that land forms are the result of single, catastrophic events), and instead espoused the geological theories of gradual development proposed by English geologist Charles Lyell (1797–1875) in his 1830 work, Principles of Geology. Yet, some of his observations in South America did not fit with Lyell's theories. Darwin disagreed with Lyell's assertion that coral reefs grew atop oceanic volcanoes and rises, and concluded that coral reefs built upon themselves. When Darwin returned to England in 1836, he and Lyell became good friends. Lyell welcomed Darwin's new research on coral reefs, and encouraged him to publish other studies from his voyages.\nDarwin was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1836, and became a member of the Royal Society in 1839. That same year, he published his Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the Various Countries Visited by H.M.S. Beagle. Though his achievements in geology largely prompted his welcoming into Britain 's scientific community, his research interests began to diverge from the discipline in the early 1840s. Discussions with other naturalists prompted Darwin's increasing interest in population diversity of fauna, extinct animals, and the presumed fixity of species. Again, he turned to notes of his observations and various specimens he gathered while on his prior expedition. The focus of his new studies was the Galápagos Islands off the Pacific coast of Ecuador . While there, Darwin was struck by the uniqueness of the island's tortoises and birds. Some neighboring islands had animal populations, which were largely similar to that of the continent, while others had seemingly different variety of species. After analyzing finch specimen from the Galápagos, Darwin concluded that species must have some means of transmutation, or ability of a species to alter over time. Darwin thus proposed that as species modified, and as old species disappeared, new varieties could be introduced. Thus, Darwin proposed an evolutionary model of animal populations.\nThe idea of organic evolution was not novel. French naturalist, Georges Buffon (1707–1788) had theorized that species were prone to development and change. Darwin's own grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, also published research regarding the evolution of species. Although the theoretical concept of evolution was not new, it remained undeveloped prior to Charles Darwin . Just as he had done with Lyell's geological theory, Darwin set about the further the understanding of evolution not merely as a philosophical concept, but as a practical scientific model for explaining the diversity of species and populations. His major contribution to the field was the introduction of a mechanism by which evolution was accomplished. Darwin believed that evolution was the product of an ongoing struggle of species to better adapt to their environment, with those that were best adapted surviving to reproduce and replace less-suited individuals. He called this phenomenon \"survival of the fittest,\" or natural selection. In this way, Darwin believed that traits of maximum adaptiveness were transferred to future generations of the animal population, eventually resulting in new species.\nDarwin finished an extensive draft of his theories in 1844, but lacked confidence in his abilities to convince others of the merits of his discoveries. Years later, prompted by rumors that a colleague was about to publish a theory similar    to his own, Darwin decided to release his research. On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, was published November 1859, and became an instant bestseller.\nA common misconception is that On the Origin of Species was the introduction of the concept of human evolution. In fact, a discussion of human antiquity is relatively absent from the book. Darwin did not directly address the relationship between animal and human evolution until he published The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871. Darwin introduced not only a model for the biological evolution of man, but also attempted to chart the process of man's psychological evolution. He further tried to break down the barriers between man and animals in 1872 with his work The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. By observing facial features and voice sounds, Darwin asserted that man and non-human animals exhibited signs of emotion in similar ways. In the last years of his career, Darwin took the concept of organic evolution to its logical end by applying natural selection and specialization to the plant kingdom.\nDarwin's works on evolution met with both debate from the scientific societies, and criticism from some members of the clergy. On the Origin of Species and The Descent of Man were both published at a time of heightened religious evangelicalism in England. Though willing to discuss his theories with colleagues in the sciences, Darwin refrained from participating in public debates concerning his research. In the last decade of his life, Darwin was disturbed about the application of his evolutionary models to social theory. By most accounts, he considered the emerging concept of the social and cultural evolution of men and civilizations, which later became known as Social Darwinism, to be a grievous misinterpretation of his works. Regardless of his opposition, he remained publicly taciturn about the impact his scientific theories on theology, scientific methodology, and social theory. Closely guarding his privacy, Darwin retired to his estate in Down. He died at Down House in 1882. Though his wishes were to receive an informal burial, Parliament immediately ordered a state burial for the famous naturalist at Westminster Abby. By the time of his death, the scientific community had largely accepted the arguments favoring his theories of evolution. Although the later discoveries in genetics and molecular biology radically reinterpreted Darwin's evolutionary mechanisms, evolutionary theory is the key and unifying theory in all biological science.\nSee also Evolution and evolutionary mechanisms; Evolutionary origin of bacteria and viruses\nCite this article\nCOPYRIGHT 2003 The Gale Group, Inc.\nDarwin, Charles Robert (1809-1882)\nEnglish naturalist\nCharles Robert Darwin is credited with popularizing the concept of organic evolution by means of natural selection.

His pioneering work in the theory of    evolution wrought a revolution in the study of the origins and nature of plant and animal life.\nThe son of Robert Darwin, a prominent English physician, Charles had an early interest in natural history, especially hunting, collecting, and geology. At his father's urging, Darwin attended medical school at Edinburgh , but found that he had little interest in medicine and returned home after two years. Wanting his son to have a respectable career, Darwin's father suggested that he should become an Anglican clergyman. Because the quiet, scholarly life of the clergyman appealed to him, Darwin agreed. He completed his degree at Cambridge in 1831. While awaiting an assignment, he was recommended for the job of naturalist on the survey ship Beagle, a voyage of nearly five years. In 1859 Darwin published The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection based on his discoveries during this voyage.\nThis seminal work contained three major discoveries. First, it presented an overwhelming amount of physical evidence of Darwin's evolutionary thesis. Naturalists had observed evolutionary change since the time of the ancient Greeks, and by the mid-1800s the idea of evolution was \"in the air.\" But it was not until Darwin published Origin that a body of empirical evidence supported the idea of evolution. Because of Darwin's thorough and compelling work, almost no biologists today doubt the reality of evolution. Second, Darwin discovered descent from common ancestry, demonstrating that all living things are related. Tracing the lineage of any two species back far enough, one can find a common ancestor. The modern fossil record and biochemical comparisons among species verify this observation. Earlier theorists such as Jean Baptiste de Lamarck had assumed that life had originated many times and that each lineage was unique and unrelated to all others. Third, Darwin discovered and described the basic mechanism by which evolution works: natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of some individuals in a population relative to that of others.\nThe Darwinian mechanism is based on differential reproductive rates. First, natural populations exhibit variation in phenotype (physical makeup) from one individual to the next, and this variation is genetically determined. For example, there is    considerable variation in human height, skin color, and so on, within a population.\nSecond, organisms are genetically programmed to reproduce. Reproduction is a very powerful biological urge, and animals will risk or even sacrifice their lives to accomplish it. Humans feel this genetic programming in several ways, as a ticking \"biological clock,\" as parental instinct, or as an attraction to children. As a result, natural populations have a tendency to overpopulate. Biologists define \"overpopulation\" in terms of limiting factors that may include food, space, mates, light, and minerals. For example, if there is enough space on an island for 1,000 deer but only enough food to sustain a population of 100, then 101 deer constitutes overpopulation. The result of overpopulation is competition among the individuals of the population for the limited resources. If there are no limited resources, there is no competition. Competition results in \"survival of the fittest,\" an unfortunate phrase that Darwin borrowed from contemporary social theorists who are now known as \"social Darwinists.\" In Darwinian terms, however, fitness    refers only to reproductive success, not to strength, size, or (in humans) economic status.\nThird, some of the variants in the population are more efficient than others in exploiting the limited resources. Success in obtaining limited resources is due largely to inherited phenotype. These individuals channel more of the limited resource through themselves and are therefore able to reproduce more successfully than individuals that compete less successfully. Thus, these selected variants pass on their genes for their genotype with greater frequency than do other variants.\nFourth, the result of this selectively favored breeding is a modification of population gene frequencies over time that may cause a change in phenotype. That is, the average state of a given character undergoing selection changes from one generation to the next. If, for example, predators feed on slower antelope, the average running speed of the population will gradually increase from generation to generation. This is observed as evolution.\nAnd lastly, the losers, those individuals less successful at exploiting limited resources and at reproduction, may die in greater numbers (if, for example, they do not find enough food) or may find an alternative to the limited resource. Galapagos finches (Darwin's finches) with thinner beaks that were less successful at eating heavy seeds often found alternative foods such as insect larvae, which are more accessible to thinner beaks. Over time, this process results in evolutionary diversification of an ancestral species into two or more progeny species, the divergence from common ancestry recognized by Darwin.\nDarwin had three great accomplishments with the publication of Origin of Species in 1859. He produced an overwhelming body of physical evidence that demonstrated the fact of evolution. Darwin also discovered descent from common ancestry and, lastly, the basic mechanism by which evolution operates—natural selection based on differential reproductive rates of individuals in a breeding population. The implications of Darwin's discoveries have profoundly influenced almost every area of knowledge from science to religion to social theory.\nSee also: Extinction\nCOPYRIGHT 2002 The Gale Group Inc.\nDarwin, Charles\nEnglish naturalist 1809–1882\nCharles Darwin was the founder of modern evolutionary thought, and the developer, along with Alfred Russel Wallace, of the theory that natural selection    is a principle driving force in evolution. Darwin is generally recognized as the single greatest thinker in the history of biology, whose contributions provided the basis for understanding the immense diversity that characterizes the natural world.\nDarwin was born February 12, 1809, into a wealthy English family. A lifelong interest in natural history led him to embark, at age twenty-two, on a five-year voyage to South America aboard the HMS Beagle as the ship's naturalist. Darwin collected a wealth of specimens and made observations of both living species and fossils he encountered. Darwin was particularly struck by similarities he observed between the species found on the Galapagos Islands off the western coast of South America, and species of the mainland. He also noted differences and similarities among species found on the numerous islands of the Galapagos. The evidence suggested each species had not been independently formed by the Creator, but rather had diverged from a smaller group of common ancestors.\nUpon returning home, Darwin pondered these ideas in conjunction with two other streams of thought. The first was the theory of uniformatarianism of geologist Charles Lyell. Uniformatarianism held that major geologic features, such as mountains and canyons, were formed not by rapid and short-lived catastrophic events such as floods, but rather by the slow, steady action of forces such as erosion. This mechanism suggested that Earth was much older than previously believed, a fact which Darwin saw provided the requisite time for the steady accumulation of change that would turn one species into another. The second idea was from An Essay on the Principle of Population, in which economist Thomas Malthus contrasted the potential for exponential increase in human population with the much slower increase in food supply. Malthus suggested that competition, disease, war, and famine kept the human population in check. Darwin saw that this principle provided the selective force needed to bring about change in a species.\nNatural Selection\nBetween 1837 and 1838, Darwin developed his ideas into the principle of natural selection, which combines struggle, heritable variation, and differential reproduction. He proposed that in all species, limited resources leads to a struggle for existence, either against other members of the species, or against the environment. Members of a species differ from one another, and some of those variations influence the success of an organism's struggle. Organisms with more useful variations will leave more offspring, who inherit those variations and so are better able to cope with the environment. As this process continues over time, with successive rounds of struggle, variation, and differential reproduction, the population will become increasingly well adapted to the environment. Organisms of one species who become separated into different environments, such as the birds of the Galapagos, could develop over time into separate species through the accumulation of differences best adapted for their separate environments.\nFor the next decade, Darwin collected evidence to support his theory, and discussed his ideas only with a small circle of colleagues. But in 1858, he learned that naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace had developed a similar theory. Urged on by friends, Darwin agreed in 1858 to jointly submit papers     with Wallace to the Journal of the Linnaean Society, and this was how the world first learned of the principle of natural selection. A year later, Darwin published On the Origin of Species, or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life. It is no exaggeration to call this the most important book ever published in biology. In it, Darwin provided so convincing an argument for natural selection that it became widely accepted by scientists shortly after publication. With natural selection, Darwin had provided a mechanism for evolution and an explanation for the diversity of life.\nDespite the power of the arguments Darwin provided, numerous problems remained with the theory, especially with the mechanism of inheritance. Critics argued that blending of traits (for instance, tall with short to give medium height) would ultimately dilute out any variations. It was not until the particulate nature of inheritance was discovered, from the work of Gregor Mendel, that this problem was resolved.\nDarwin continued to explore the ramifications of natural selection in a series of books published over the next twenty years. In 1871, he published The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in which he applied the theory of natural selection to argue that humans evolved from earlier apelike creatures, and suggested sexual selection as an important adjunct to natural selection.\nHUXLEY, THOMAS HENRY (1825–1895)\nEnglish biologist and paleontologist famous for his enthusiastic public debates in support of English naturalist Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.

He died at the age of seventy-three on April 19, 1882. Darwin revolutionized biology with his theory of evolution by natural selection. Although others contributed to the theory of evolution, Darwin was the first to win wide approval from the world's experts in biology.\nDarwin was the son of a physician and the grandson of the physician and naturalist Erasmus Darwin. In the 1790s Erasmus Darwin proposed a theory of evolution. Darwin studied medicine at Edinburgh University and religion at Cambridge University . He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cambridge in 1831. There, his interest in biology was encouraged by his friendship with John Stevens Henslow, who studied plants. Henslow recommended Darwin as naturalist for a scientific expedition to South America . In 1831 Darwin began the five-year journey aboard the ship HMS Beagle. He gained valuable knowledge about the plants, animals, and natural features of the lands that he visited. In 1839 Darwin married his first cousin, Emma Wedgewood. They had ten children, seven surviving past childhood.\nBy 1846 Darwin had published several works on his discoveries about coral reefs and volcanic islands. For his writings and other scientific activities, he became greatly respected in the scientific community. Darwin spent years developing his theory on evolution. It is believed that he waited a long time to share it with the world because he feared the religious controversy that would result. He finally was moved to go public when he received a paper from Alfred Wallace in 1858. Wallace had the same ideas that Darwin had been pondering for 20 years. Darwin and Wallace presented their theories in a joint paper to the Linnean Society in 1858. In 1859 Darwin published his famous book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. While the theory was accepted quickly in most scientific circles, religious leaders strongly opposed it. Many religious persons felt that the theory was inconsistent with the biblical book of Genesis . They feared that God had no place in Darwin's world. They claimed that in Darwin's theory, man was descended from apes and not placed in a superior position over other animals.\nDarwin expanded his theory in other publications. His theories included the following: (1) most evolutionary changes were very gradual, requiring millions of years; (2) natural selection was the driving force behind evolutionary change; and (3) today's millions of species branched out from a single, original life form.\nDarwin's theories spurred further research in biology. Charles Darwin is considered one of the greatest figures in the history of biology.\nsee also Adaptation; Biological Evolution; Natural Selection.\nDenise Prendergast\nThe Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.\nCopyright The Columbia University Press\nCharles Robert Darwin, 1809–82, English naturalist, b. Shrewsbury; grandson of Erasmus Darwin and of Josiah Wedgwood . He firmly established the theory of organic evolution known as Darwinism . He studied medicine at Edinburgh and for the ministry at Cambridge but lost interest in both professions during the training. His interest in natural history led to his friendship with the botanist J. S. Henslow ; through him came the opportunity to make a five-year cruise (1831–36) as official naturalist aboard the Beagle. This started Darwin on a career of accumulating and assimilating data that resulted in the formulation of his concept of evolution and his explication of natural and sexual selection . He spent the remainder of his life carefully and methodically working over the information from his copious notes and from every other available source.\nIndependently, the naturalist A. R. Wallace had worked out a concept of evolution similar to Darwin's. Wallace sent a paper outlining his theory to Darwin in 1858, and its striking coincidences with Darwin's work led Darwin's friends to move to assure that the more cautious Darwin, who had been slow to publish, would receive credit for the independence and priority of his ideas. The next year Darwin set forth the structure of his theory and massive support for it in the superbly organized On the Origin of Species, supplemented and elaborated in his many later books, notably The Descent of Man (1871). He also formulated a theory of the origin of coral reefs.\nSee J. T. Costa, ed, The Annotated Origin: A Facsimile of the First Edition of On the Origin of Species (2009), and G. Chancellor and J.

Though he barely scraped through his degree at Cambridge, Darwin was interested in natural history from early childhood. From 1831 to 1836, he served as naturalist on HMS Beagle, a small ship that circumnavigated the world, surveying to enhance the quality of navigational charts and gathering scientific specimens for the advancement of natural history. Darwin's account of the voyage of the Beagle was a literary success but contained little hint of the paradigm shift in biological thought for which Darwin soon became notorious. Darwin reflected for over twenty years after returning from his travels, and before publishing On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859). In this and later works, Darwin developed his theory of evolution by drawing upon his empirical observations of wildlife, fossils, and the complex relationships of localized variations in the anatomy of birds, butterflies, lizards, and other animals to their environment. Darwin's theory outraged orthodox religious beliefs in the creation (based on the myths described in Genesis that God had created the world and all that lived in it in seven days). For a time, he was reviled by a large proportion of the British establishment, but his supporters, including the eminent physician and biologist Thomas Huxley (1825–1895), encouraged him and scientific evidence eventually prevailed. Much further support for Darwin's theory of evolution is contained in his prolific writings after the Origin of Species. Evolution can no longer be described as a mere theory. There is such a huge body of hard scientific evidence, including much recently acquired support from molecular genetics, that evolution may be considered a fundamental fact of life.\nJohn M.

Darwin made evolution scientifically respectable. Intended for medicine, he took courses at Edinburgh , but dropped out unable to bear surgery. He went on to Christ's College, Cambridge, took a pass degree, and became a clergyman, reading  W. Paley with pleasure. There  J.  S.  Henslow and  Adam  Sedgwick directed his enthusiasm for nature into serious science and in 1831 he was offered a place as companion to the captain on HMS Beagle surveying Cape Horn. This was the kind of opportunity that  Joseph Banks had enjoyed; and on the five-year voyage round the world,  Darwin became a great descriptive scientist and collector. Thinking about nature's diversity, and reading  T.  R. Malthus , he hit upon the idea of natural selection when he got home.\nAnimals and plants produced more young than could survive: those better adapted to their surroundings would be ‘selected’ by nature as the stock-breeder selected the woolliest or meatiest sheep, and their offspring would diverge, inheriting characteristics. Unlike earlier theories, his grandfather's or  J.  B.  Lamarck's, this did not involve progressive development in accordance with a plan or law; it was open-ended.  Darwin spent over 20 years collecting and marshalling evidence before publishing the Origin of Species in 1859. Meanwhile, he had married his cousin  Emma  Wedgwood, and settled in a remote corner of Kent; his health was poor, and he led a reclusive life, writing the standard work on barnacles. Despite furious controversy, his theory prevailed, and by the end of his life he was universally recognized.\nDavid  Knight\nWorld Encyclopedia\n© World Encyclopedia 2005, originally published by Oxford University Press 2005.\nDarwin, Charles Robert (1809–82) English naturalist, originator of a theory of evolution based on natural selection . In 1831 he joined a round-the-world expedition on HMS Beagle . Observations made of the flora and fauna of South America (especially the Galápagos Islands) formed the basis of his work on animal variation. The development of a similar theory by  A. R. Wallace led  Darwin to present his ideas to the Linnean Society in 1858, and in 1859 he published The Origin of Species, one of the world's most influential science books. Darwin argued that organisms reproduce more than is necessary to replenish their population, creating competition for survival. Opposed to the ideas of Lamarck , Darwin argued that each organism was a unique combination of genetic variations. The variations that prove helpful in the struggle to survive are passed down to the offspring of the survivors. He termed this process natural selection . Darwin did not distinguish between acquired characteristics and genetic variations. Instead, neo-Darwinism supplemented his ideas with modern research into heredity , especially mutation .\nhttp://www.aboutdarwin.com\nCOPYRIGHT 2001 The Gale Group Inc.\nDarwin, Charles\nEnglish Naturalist 1809-1882\nCharles Darwin was probably the most influential scientist of the nineteenth century. He is best known for his revolutionary ideas that species transmute, or evolve, by means of the primary mechanism of natural selection, ideas he set forth in his great work On the Origin of Species in 1859. This work shaped intellectual, political, and philosophical attitudes of the nineteenth century and fundamentally transformed humanity's understanding of its origins in terms of natural rather than supernatural causes. Though deemed controversial, his ideas continued to hold sway through the twentieth century. For these reasons, he is generally regarded as not only one of the great figures of the history of science, but also one of the great figures of the western intellectual tradition.\nEarly Life and Background\nCharles Robert Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, in Shrewsbury, England , into a wealthy, distinguished family. His paternal grandfather was Erasmus Darwin, a physician who delved into many subjects, including poetry, and who made one of the early statements in support of transmutation , or the belief that species are changeable and not fixed. His father was Robert Waring Darwin, an equally successful physician, who practiced in Shrewsbury. His mother was Susannah Wedgwood, the daughter of the industrialist potter Josiah Wedgwood.\nCharles Darwin's education began at home, largely through the efforts of his older sisters who took the place of his mother when she died prematurely. He was eventually sent to a local day school, and in 1818 he entered   Shrewsbury School, one of the great English public schools of the nineteenth century. Though a poor student, Darwin developed a keen interest in natural history at a young age, and spent many of his leisure hours collecting insects and plants.\nIn 1825 Darwin enrolled at Edinburgh University with the intent of studying medicine. He was unsuccessful in his formal studies and developed a distaste for surgery. Two years later, he gave up his medical aspirations and left Edinburgh for Cambridge University , where he intended to study theology in the hopes that he could lead the respectable life of a country vicar. He failed to perform adequately in his formal studies, however. His one true interest remained in natural history, an interest that was encouraged by the professor of botany at Cambridge, John Stevens Henslow (1796-1861). Darwin became so enamored of this mentor that he came to be known as \"the man who walks with Henslow.\" Another important influence on Darwin at this time was the professor of geology, Adam Sedgwick (1785-1873). Though Sedgwick provided the only formal training in science that Darwin was to receive, it was Henslow who provided directive influence in Darwin's life after he recommended him to the Admiralty, which was preparing a survey expedition to chart the coastline of South America . Darwin was to serve as companion to the captain, Robert FitzRoy, on the H.M.S. Beagle. On occasion he was to serve as ship's naturalist. The five-year voyage of the Beagle, beginning on December 31, 1831, and ending on October 2, 1836, was to prove the pivotal experience in shaping Darwin's subsequent scientific work. Darwin returned to England much altered from his experiences. He had not only matured during the voyage, but also distinguished himself with his superb collections, so much so that he became the center of attention in scientific circles.\nScientific Work, 1831-59\nWhile aboard the H.M.S. Beagle, Darwin was struck by the diversity of life that he encountered and how beautifully adapted it was to diverse environments. As he traveled up and down the eastern coastline of South America he was especially interested in the geographic distribution of plants and animals that appeared to replace each other. More importantly, he was taken by the fact that extinct fossils in the area closely resembled living forms of related species, and that the flora and fauna on oceanic islands bore a striking similarity to the nearest continental landmass. He became particularly interested in the distribution of the flora and fauna of a string of recently formed volcanic islands known as the Galapagos, after the unique species of tortoises that are found there. Darwin noticed that each island in the group had an entirely unique flora and fauna. He also noticed that the species bore a striking resemblance to the species on the nearest continental landmass, the western part of South America. With insights from British geologist Sir Charles Lyell (1797-1875), who espoused a uniformitarian rather than a catastrophist geological theory, the weight of this geographic evidence suggested to Darwin that species had not been independently created. They had instead slowly diverged from preexisting species as they came to colonize new habitats and as they adapted to new ecological niches .\nAlthough Darwin had recognized this geographic pattern, he did not have an explanation or a mechanism for how the flora and fauna were able to adapt themselves to their respective environments. The mechanism of evolution occurred to him only after his return to England and after he had been able to sort through his collections. The decisive moment came two years after his return while he was reading English economist Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798). In this famous essay, Malthus had noticed that human populations, if left unchecked, had the tendency to double each generation. In other words, their pattern of growth was exponential. But Malthus also noted that resources necessary to sustain populations increased at a much slower rate, or arithmetically. To Malthus, this meant one thing: that at some point members of the population were subjected to strong competition for those resources, and that such events as war, disease, and famine were natural ways to keep the population in step with available resources. Darwin realized that this principle could just as easily apply to populations of animals and plants. In the competitive struggle for existence, Darwin added, those individuals who bore favorable characteristics would be more likely to survive to reproduce. They in turn were more likely to transmit these favorable characteristics to their offspring. Given enough time, subsequent generations of their offspring would depart from the parental types. Given more time, Darwin added, they would diverge even further from their ancestral types, eventually leading to new species. This principle of divergence strengthened and supported what Darwin called his theory of descent with modification by the mechanism of natural selection. It is what accounted for the origin of species.\nAlthough he had formulated his theory between 1837 and 1838—now recognized as the critical period for Darwin's intellectual development— Darwin did not set these ideas formally on paper until 1842 in a rough sketch, and in 1844 in what is called his historical essay. He showed this short manuscript only to his close friend, the young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817-1911). Instead of publishing his theory, Darwin continued his research into the late 1850s, hoping to collect enough evidence to support what he knew to be a very controversial theory. Between 1837 and 1859 Darwin therefore engaged in a number of research projects intended to lend support to his theory, including some botanical studies to understand adaptation.\nAfter formulating his theory, Darwin's plan was to collect data carefully from workers around the world to fortify his theory. In particular he was interested in both plant and animal breeding practices, which had been created by artificial selection, a form of selection through human intervention. He became especially interested in pigeon breeding, a popular hobby for Victorians, because it clearly demonstrated the stunning range of variation possible through artificial selection.\nIn 1839 Darwin married his first cousin, Emma Wedgwood, and in 1842 the couple left London to settle in the nearby village of Downe. There Darwin could escape from the bustle of the city and devote himself fully to his research. The quiet country environment removed from society was also important to Darwin, who began to suffer from an unknown illness, which sometimes left him incapacitated. Only a select group of scientists had access to him. By the 1850s, the inner circle of Darwin's friends, in addition  to Hooker and Lyell, included a young morphologist, Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895), who became Darwin's intellectual defender.\nPublication of On the Origin of Species\nDarwin's peaceful existence was shattered in 1858 when he received a letter from a young naturalist named Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913). Wallace had been exploring the Malay Archipelago in Southeast Asia . Darwin faced the contents of the letter with mixed feelings: Wallace had reproduced much of Darwin's secret theory, leaving Darwin to face a possible priority dispute. At the advice of the inner circle, Darwin and Wallace published their work jointly in the Journal of the Linnaean Society in 1858. Darwin used the push from Wallace to complete a longer account of his theory, and included evidence he had gathered not only from his own observations and experiments, but also from his correspondence with naturalists and breeders from around the world. Darwin intended this work to be merely an abstract of his longer theory, but the published book was over four hundred pages. Its full title in the first 1859 edition was On the Origin of Species or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life. The book appeared in bookstores on November 24, 1859, and promptly sold out on the first day. It was to go through six editions.\nDarwin's life was permanently changed as the theory that Huxley named \"evolution\" became a topic of heated debate. It was criticized on the scientific front because it failed to provide an adequate theory of heredity and because blending theories of heredity, popular at the time, would have led to a dilution of favorable characteristics. This problem was addressed only after Darwin's death by the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel and his theory of heredity in 1900. Another problem was the age of Earth , which was thought to be about four hundred million years old, an insufficient amount of time to account for the slow, gradual process that Darwin envisioned. This problem was solved after the discovery of radioactivity in the late nineteenth century that, when included in calculations, increased the age of Earth to nearly five billion years, an estimate of time long enough to account for evolution. Yet another difficulty was the fact that Darwin had no direct proof for a process that took place over a long stretch of time. Darwin knew this, and predicted that it would take some fifty years to accumulate enough evidence to support this theory. This was in fact provided beginning in 1920s with the example of industrial melanism in the peppered moth, Biston betularia.\nMore difficult to resolve were the theological and philosophical questions that followed from the mechanism of natural selection. Even though Darwin had only one line on human evolution in the book, the theory implied that humans were subject to the same mechanistic process as plants and animals. Mechanistic and materialistic, natural selection also challenged the argument for God 's existence from design and led to a non-purposive view of the world. To some, like the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a competitive nonpurposive view of nature implied that it was \"red in tooth and claw.\"\nDespite a storm of controversy over the mechanism, the fact of evolution was rapidly accepted by scientists. Only after the mechanism of heredity was understood and only after the science of genetics was integrated with  natural history was the debate over the mechanism of natural selection extinguished. This did not take place until the interval of time between 1920 and 1950 and was part of the event called the evolutionary synthesis.\nBotanical Work\nFrom the start, plants figured prominently in the development of Darwin's ideas of evolution by means of natural selection. Examples from the plant world abound in On the Origin of Species and Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication (1868). Not only were plants easily studied and bred, but they showed a stunning assortment of adaptive features. They were to prove one of Darwin's favorite objects of study, becoming the basis of no less than seven books, most of which appeared in the latter part of Darwin's life.\nDarwin's first book on plant evolution was titled Fertilization in Orchids (1862). He chose to study orchids because of the range of adaptations they displayed with respect to fertilization. Darwin recognized that these elaborate adaptations served to facilitate cross-pollination by insects such as bees. For this reason, cross-pollinated plants had flowers with bright colors and fragrant nectaries to attract bees and other insects, while wind-pollinated plants, which did not have to attract insect pollinators, had flowers with little or no color.\nDarwin also observed that plants that seemed to have one or few flowers had the tendency to be hermaphrodites, having flowers of both sexes on the same plant. Bigger trees with a large number of small flowers, however, usually had flowers of only one sex. To Darwin, this implied that flowers had adapted mechanisms to ensure cross-pollination. This likely increased the variability, and also increased the vigor of the offspring. Darwin performed numerous experiments to understand the manner in which cross-pollination took place in plants and to understand the adaptive function of increased variability. In the process he noted the phenomenon of heterosis, or hybrid vigor, in the progeny of cross-pollinated plants. He also began to unravel the adaptive functions of sexual reproduction.\nDarwin's work in pollination mechanisms appeared in two books. The first was Effects of Cross and Self Fertilization (1876), which was followed by Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species (1877).\nDarwin was also interested in the adaptive functions of climbing plants. He found that the phenomenon of twining , or the differential bending of plants in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner around an object, permitted young or weak plants to raise themselves higher up off the ground. This maximized exposure to air and sunlight in a relatively short time, and without the costly and time-consuming investment of woody supportive structures. The various means used by plants to climb were explored in his book Climbing Plants (1875). The mechanisms by which this and other plant movements took place was explored in Power of Movement in Plants (1880). In this book Darwin explored plant tropisms, or the manner in which plants were able to grow toward light. He determined that the stem bends toward the light because of differential growth rates: the illuminated side grew more slowly than the unilluminated side so that shoot tips appeared to bend toward the light. He postulated the existence of a substance that was diffused  from the apex downward that affected growth rates. These investigations anticipated the existence and action of plant hormones.\nDarwin then directed his attention to other types of movements in plants, including mechanisms for prey capture in insectivorous plants such as the sundew, Drosera rotundifolia (1880). After detailed observation and experimentation, Darwin concluded that carnivorous plants had acquired the ability to live in nitrogen-poor soil with little or no root structure by feeding on prey. In addition to developing sensory apparatus to detect and capture prey, plants had also developed a digestive system capable of breaking down proteins. Most of these observations, including experiments with the sundew plants, were the focus of his book Insectivorous Plants (1875).\nDarwin's last book relating to plants was a work with a strangely ecological theme: the action of worms in turning up soil. After experiments that ran for more than fifty years, Darwin postulated that earthworms played a vital ecological role: they fed on dead leaves and other organic matter and excreted this back into the soil. In so doing, earthworms served to aerate the soil and recycle vital nutrients. These results, including quantitative estimates of how much soil was processed by earthworms, were included in The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms (1881).\nDarwin's botanical work is notable for its detailed observations and simple, elegant experiments. These were performed in the confines of Darwin's backyard or at greenhouses at his home in Downe. Despite the fact that some of these are now classic experiments reproduced by students the world over, they were judged harshly by the leading German plant physiologist of the late nineteenth century, Julius von Sachs (1832-1897). A revolutionary experimentalist who introduced powerful analytical laboratory methods to botanical science, launching the \"New Botany,\" Sachs thought Darwin's naturalist tendency and simple backyard experiments to be antiquated and amateur. Nonetheless, Darwin's botanical work remains the cornerstone of his studies on variation and mechanisms of adaptation in plants and is significant for his keen insights.\nThe book on earthworms was published just six months before Darwin's death. Until his end, Darwin remained a productive scientist. Some of his most imaginative work was performed toward the end of his long life. His was a happy and productive life in a home filled with the voices of his ten children and numerous grandchildren. On his death in 1882, he received a rare honor for a scientist: he was given a state burial and was buried at Westminster Abbey .\nsee also Carnivorous Plants; Compost; Evolution of Plants; Evolution of Plants, History of; Hooker, Joseph Dalton; Mendel, Gregor; Orchidaceae; Phylogeny; Sachs, Julius von; Tropisms and Nastic Movements.\nVassiliki Betty Smocovitis\nA Dictionary of Biology\n© A Dictionary of Biology 2004, originally published by Oxford University Press 2004.\nDarwin, Charles (1809–82) British naturalist, who studied medicine in Edinburgh followed by theology at Cambridge University , intending a career in the Church.

                "The Galápagos Islands: Darwin's inspiration - Telegraph\nTelegraph\nThe Galapagos Islands: Darwin's inspiration\nA 'deviant but perfectâ€™ marine iguana\nRachel Hoyes\n1 April 2014 • 12:00am\nA dark, alien shape moved beneath the pier. Snake-like in its lateral movement, it cut an easy, tortuous line through the water. I watched, mesmerised, as it eased itself onto the shore where it paused, as if for breath, its claws and black spines glistening. With a heave of its belly it spat salt water from its nostrils. Grotesque, yet beautiful; deviant, yet perfectly adapted. What had emerged from the harbour was a lizard, a reptile that had, in a riposte to its land-loving ancestors, dragged itself back to the sea in search of food. Not a process of devolution, but a feat of evolutionary survival.\nMarine iguanas are found only on the Galápagos Islands, a volcanic archipelago in the Pacific 600 miles off the Ecuadorean coast. Known as the place that helped to spawn Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection, the islands have an almost mythic status. They have even been charted in cyberspace: those who visit the islands this season will have had the chance to see them first on Google’s Street View map.\nSo could these islands live up to their reputation? Darwin himself was not immediately impressed by all the wildlife he saw. In the notebook he kept to document his voyage aboard the Beagle, he described the marine iguana as “hideous-looking, stupid and sluggish in its movements”. Little did he know then that this creature represented a triumph of life.\nI set out to discover the islands in the same way as Darwin: by sailing boat. For the next six days my home was to be the 70ft La Encantada, or the Enchanted. There were 12 of us on board, plus four attentive crew members and an English-speaking guide. I fell under the spell of the Galápagos immediately. Within minutes of the start of our voyage, the abundance of wildlife was clear. A swirl of sea birds looped above us before plunging like a hail of missiles into the water. Brown pelicans, scooping low across the surface, joined in the frenzy, while frigate birds hovered ready to thieve a catch. A splash near the boat distracted me. Dolphins? No, the Galápagos are never that obvious: this was a manta ray, flashing its black-and-white belly as it flipped into the air. All this, and we had scarcely left the harbour.\nBlue-footed boobies\nThe first leg of our journey took us from Baltra Island to its neighbour, Santa Cruz. We stopped at Dragon Hill, a jagged peak presiding ominously over the land inhabited by the iguanas after which it is named. Away from the beach the landscape gave way to miles of bushy scrubland. Yet, even in such an apparently uninhabitable environment, life had flourished. There were finches perched among cactus spines; yellow warblers busying themselves in the bushes; and many iguanas.\nThe sun began its descent, burnishing the landscape with gold. The sandy trail opened up to a large lagoon. And there, wading through the silence, was a pair of flamingos. Salmon-pink against the blue lagoon, they dipped like ballet dancers towards their reflections. One stepped close enough for us to hear it dabbling as it cupped its beak through the shallows. I began to understand why Darwin described the islands’ animals as “strangers to man”. So unafraid of our presence were they that it was as if we had walked into their Arcadian world unseen.\nDarwin frequently put the animals’ naivety to the test. He sat astride the native giant tortoises and, using “a few raps on the hinder part of their shell”, discovered he could ride them. (He also noted that the young tortoises were “excellent” in soup.) He flung a marine iguana into the sea to see how it would react when frightened, and pulled a burrowing iguana out of its hole by the tail.\nOn our first evening we were served dinner before setting sail for Isabela Island. I later realised that this was to ensure that the food remained on the table. My stomach proved a less successful receptacle. The passage was unforgivingly rough and our boat listed so violently I thought I would roll out of my bunk. It was a relief at 6am to hear the running chain of the anchor and know that we had neared dry land.\nIt was time for our first snorkel. The clear turquoise water, sparkling under the equatorial sun, had every appearance of enticing warmth. But during the dry season (June to December) the Humboldt Current sweeps north from Chile, bringing an array of wildlife, but also cold water. It can’t be that bad, I thought, I’m used to frigid English beaches. The immersion was overwhelming; the cold gripped my body as the water filled my wetsuit. A chorus of yelps piping through my fellow voyagers’ snorkels told me that I was not alone in my sensations.\nThe islands’ most famous inhabitant, the giant tortoise\nBut I soon forgot about my shivering limbs. Almost immediately we were greeted by a couple of playful young sea lions. They wheeled and arced around us, diving low in a stream of bubbles before reappearing as if to ask why we hadn’t followed. One put its whiskered nose up to mine and peered into my mask. They were as excited to see us as we them.\nAlmost every day we had an opportunity to snorkel, and never did it disappoint. Turtles were the highlight of one swim – I gave up counting at 30. Some dived with graceful strokes, some surfaced to let out a puff of air, others allowed themselves to be dragged back and forth by the waves.\nOn another swim, I was astonished to come across a whitetip reef shark barely 6ft away. Seconds later I realised I was drifting above a school of dozens. And I had woken them up. I knew that reef sharks do not usually attack humans, but I wasn’t sure if that would be true if they were disturbed. When I noticed that one was circling, carefully watching me with hollow black eyes and a thin crack of a smile, I decided it was time to move on.\nAnd, this being the Galápagos, I immediately entered another scene that could have come from a nature documentary. I was alerted to a commotion by a thick jet of bubbles. A pelican landed by my ear, bobbing on the surface in anticipation. I turned to see a male sea lion pounding through the water. This was not playtime: he was hunting. Intent on his task, he ignored my boyfriend and I, who had stopped to watch, and down he plunged again, fish scattering in plumes.\nOur journey continued around the west coast of Isabela. The channel between this island and Fernandina is a whale crossing, and we sat up on deck hoping to see one. We were joined by our guide, who seemed able to spot wildlife even if it was behind him. “There!” he shouted, before a spout of water and a smooth gleaming back appeared. Our collective whoop of excitement modulated into howls of revulsion as, thanks to a sudden breeze, we were showered with the whale’s fetid spout water. Tasting a whale’s stale breath was not quite the intimate moment I had hoped for.\nThe sun sets quickly at the equator; there is no lingering twilight. Instead the sun stains the clouds red and orange in a final show of bravura before being claimed by the horizon. As I turned I saw a strange silver glow on the ocean’s edge. It was the moon rising, the sea now appearing like liquid metal beneath its silvery flare. At moments like these, the Galápagos are at their most enchanting.\nThe following day we landed near Punta Moreno at a nesting site for blue-footed boobies – one of the archipelago’s star attractions . Heedless of our presence, a couple carried out a mating dance: the male lifting his clownish blue feet in exaggerated steps like a beached scuba diver. His female companion spread her wings and bowed in return. Then nervousness came over the birds; they whistled and honked as they waddled back to their fluffy chicks. A hawk had perched over the nesting ground and was surveying its spread. I was relieved when it moved off.\nWe spent a peaceful night moored up in Tagus Cove, once a favourite anchorage for pirates and whalers. We crossed the equator, the captain sounding the horn as we did so, and arrived on Santiago Island. Sand the colour of cocoa powder was bordered by mangrove forests and turtle nesting sites. A loud, deep bleating noise announced the presence of a sea lion pup shuffling up the beach. It nosed its way into a group of uninterested females. It was looking for its mother, our guide told us, who could be absent for days at a time looking for food. Failing to rouse any sea lions from their slumber, the pup dragged itself dejectedly to our group, looked up and let out another loud bleat. We were no longer observing nature, we had become part of its drama.\nSuch engagement with wildlife is what made these Enchanted Isles, as Herman Melville called them, so captivating. Throughout its history the archipelago has seen many visitors: whalers, pirates, naval officers, prisoners, tourists and now internet explorers. And yet its uniqueness endures; it remains, to use Darwin’s phrase, “a little world within itself”.\nBalletic flamingos\nEssentials\nKLM flies from Heathrow to Guayaquil via Amsterdam from £637 return.

                "Astrology of Charles Darwin with horoscope chart, quotes, biography, and images\n,\nEngland\n.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½\n(Speculative Ascendants, Sagittarius, Capricorn or Virgo;ï¿½ with Moon            in Capricorn or perhaps Aquarius; Sun and Mercury in Aquarius; Venus            in Aries; Mars in Libra; Jupiter and Pluto in Pisces; Saturn and Neptune            in Sagittarius; Uranus in Scorpio).\nCharles Darwin is best known for his book ï¿½The Origin of the Speciesï¿½            in which he promotes his theory of evolution known as ï¿½natural selectionï¿½.            Great controversy followed the publication of this book, and grew even            more intense after the publication of ï¿½The Descent of Manï¿½\nDarwinï¿½s writings were responsible for a revolution in the field of            biological science. The field of orthodox religion was especially challenged            with his thought that man was not a special creation but had evolved            from the ï¿½apesï¿½ï¿½or some original ancestor related to the lemurs.ï¿½\nIt is probably not possible to establish the accuracy of the Ascendant            nor of the Moon which would change to Aquarius if the Virgo Ascendant            were correct. We can realize, however, the combination of the forward            looking, scientific and potentially revolutionary Aquarius, in combination            with the fifth rayï¿½very probably\nDarwinï¿½s            soul ray. He was responsible for a revolution in the field of biological            science and a drastic alteration of humanityï¿½s philosophical world-view            (a development which fits well with the Capricorn rising chart which            places revolutionary Uranus in H9ï¿½the house of perspective and broad            understanding.)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½\n \nA            man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value            of life.\n(Capricorn Moon)\nA scientific man            ought to have no wishes, no affections, - a mere heart of stone.\n(Capricorn Moon. Venus in Aries.)\nAnimals, whom we            have made our slaves, we do not like to consider our equal.\nFalse facts are            highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long;            but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for            every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness.\nI am turned into a sort of machine for observing facts and grinding out conclusions.\n(Mercury conjunct Pluto in Pisces, trine Uranus conjunct Ascendant.)\nI cannot persuade            myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created            parasitic wasps with the express intention of their feeding within the            living bodies of Caterpillars.\nIf the misery of            the poor be caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions,            great is our sin.\nIgnorance more frequently            begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little,            and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that            problem will never be solved by science.\nIn the survival            of favoured individuals and races, during the constantly-recurring struggle            for existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of selection.\nIt has been a bitter            mortification for me to digest the conclusion that the 'race is for            the strong' and that I shall probably do little more but be content            to admire the strides others made in science.\nWe can allow satellites,            planets, suns, universe, nay whole systems of universes, to be governed            by laws, but the smallest insect, we wish to be created at once by special            act.\nWe must, however,            acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all his noble qualities...            still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.\nA hairy quadruped,            furnished with a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal in its habits.\nReferring to the            ancestry of humankind, according to Darwin’s theory. “For            my own part,” Darwin wrote, “I would as soon be descended            from that heroic little monkey ... or that old baboon ... as from a            savage who delights to torture his enemies, offers up bloody sacrifices,            practices infanticide without remorse, treats his wives like slaves,            knows no decency, and is haunted by the grossest superstitions.”\nThe highest possible            stage in moral culture is when we recognize that we ought to control            our thoughts.\nMan is more courageous,            pugnacious, and energetic than woman, and has a more inventive genius.            His brain is absolutely larger, but whether or not proportionally to            his larger body, has not, I believe, been fully ascertained. In woman            the face is rounder; the jaws and the base of skull smaller; the outlines            of the body rounder, in parts more prominent; and her pelvis is broader            than in man; but this latter character may perhaps be considered rather            as a primary than a secondary sexual character. She comes to maturity            at an earlier age than man.\nFrom the war of            nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are            capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals,            directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several            powers, having been breathed into a few forms or into one; and that,            whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of            gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and            most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\nMan with all his            noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with            benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest            living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into            the movements and constitution of the solar system—with all these            exalted powers—man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible            stamp of his lowly origin.\nThere can be no            doubt that the difference between the mind of the lowest man and that            of the highest animal is immense. An anthropomorphous ape, if he could            take a dispassionate view of his own case, would admit that though he            could form an artful plan to plunder a garden—though he could            use stones for fighting or for breaking open nuts, yet that the thought            of fashioning a stone into a tool was quite beyond his scope. Still            less, as he would admit, could he follow out a train of metaphysical            reasoning, or solve a mathematical problem, or reflect on God, or admire            a grand natural scene. Some apes, however, would probably declare that            they could and did admire the beauty of the coloured skin and fur of            their partners in marriage. They would admit, that though they could            make other apes understand by cries some of their perceptions and simpler            wants, the notion of expressing definite ideas by definite sounds had            never crossed their minds. They might insist that they were ready to            aid their fellow-apes of the same troop in many ways, to risk their            lives for them, and to take charge of their orphans; but they would            be forced to acknowledge that disinterested love for all living creatures,            the most noble attribute of man, was quite beyond their comprehension.            Nevertheless, the difference in mind between man and the higher animals,            great as it is, is one of degree and not of kind.\nThe expression            often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is            more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\nBelieving as I            do that man in the distant future will be a far more perfect creature            than he now is, it is an intolerable thought that he and all other sentient            beings are doomed to complete annihilation after such long-continued            slow progress. To those who fully admit the immortality of the human            soul, the destruction of our world will not appear so dreadful.\nAs for a future            life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague probabilities.\nI love fools’ experiments. I am always making them.\nPhysiological experiment            on animals is justifiable for real investigation, but not for mere damnable            and detestable curiosity.\nWe will now discuss            in a little more detail the Struggle for Existence.\nI have called this            principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved,            by the term Natural Selection.\nEven in the worm            that crawls in the earth there glows a divine spark. When you slaughter            a creature, you slaughter God.\nTo suppose that            the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus            to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and            for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have            been formed by natural selection, seems, I confess, absurd in the highest            degree.\nThe love for all            living creatures is the most noble attribute of man.\nA man's friendships            are one of the best measures of his worth.\nMathematics seems            to endow one with something like a new sense.\nAn American Monkey            after getting drunk on Brandy would never touch it again, and thus is            much wiser than most men.\nThe universe we            observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at            bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but blind,            pitiless indifference.\nFrom the first            dawn of life, all organic beings are found to resemble each other in            descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under groups.            This classification is evidently not arbitrary like the grouping of            stars in constellations.\nAbout to start            the Origin of Species in 1856: What a book a Devil's Chaplain might            write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low & horridly cruel works            of nature!\nEvery new body            of discovery is mathematical in form, because there is no other guidance            we can have.\nWe have seen that            the senses and intuitions, the various emotions and faculties, such            as love, memory, attention and curiosity, imitation, reason, etc., of            which man boasts, may be found in an incipient, or even sometimes in            a well-developed condition, in the lower animals.\nIf I had my life            to live over again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and            listen to some music at least once a week; for perhaps the parts of            my brain now atrophied would have thus been kept active through use.            The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be            injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character,            by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature.\nThe plow is one            of the most ancient and most valuable of man's inventions; but long            before he existed the land was in fact regularly plowed, and still continues            to be thus plowed by earthworms. It may be doubted whether there are            many other animals which have played so important a part in the history            of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures.\nIt is not the strongest            of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most            responsive to change.\n(Uranus conjunct Ascendant)\nThe very essence            of instinct is that it's followed independently of reason.\nIt has been a bitter            mortification for me to digest the conclusion that the 'race is for            the strong' and that I shall probably do little more but be content            to admire the strides others made in science.\n...it is always            advisable to perceive clearly our ignorance.\nWithout speculation            there is no good and original observation.\nThe presence of            a body of well-instructed men, who have not to labor for their daily            bread, is important to a degree which cannot be overestimated; as all            high intellectual work is carried on by them, and on such work material            progress of all kinds mainly depends, not to mention other and higher            advantages.\nI have steadily            endeavored to keep my mind free so as to give up any hypothesis, however            much beloved (and I cannot resist forming one on every subject), as            soon as the facts are shown to be opposed to it.\n\"[T]he lower            animals, like man, manifestly feel pleasure and pain, happiness and            misery. Happiness is never better exhibited than by young animals, such            as puppies, kittens, lambs, &c., when playing together, like our            own children. Even insects play together, as has been described by that            excellent observer, P.

People made a religion of them.”\n“At some            future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized            races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace the savage            races throughout the world”\n“I have tried            lately to read Shakespeare, and found it so intolerably dull that it            nauseated me.”\n“It is a            cursed evil to any man to become as absorbed in any subject as I am            in mine”\nCharles Darwin quote\n“Man tends            to increase at a greater rate than his means of subsistence”\n“Believing            as I do that man in the distant future will be a far more perfect creature            than he now is, it is an intolerable thought that he and all other sentient            beings are doomed to complete annihilation after such long-continued            slow progress”\n“I fully            subscribe to the judgement of those writers who maintain that of all            the differences between man and the lower animal, the moral sense of            conscience is by far the most important....It is the most noble of all            the attributes of man.”\n“The chief            distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is shown by            man attaining to a higher eminence, in whatever he takes up, than woman            can attain - whether requiring deep thought, reason, or imagination,            or merely the use of the senses”\n“Why then            is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate            links?

It has            not the character of a physical law and is therefore utterly useless.            It foretells nothing because we know nothing of the will of the Deity,            how it acts and whether constant or inconstant like that of man.”\n“[The wedge            document calls the proposition that human beings are created in the            image of God] one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization            is built. ... not as moral and spiritual beings, but as animals or machines            who inhabited a universe ruled by purely impersonal forces and whose            behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the unbending forces of            biology, chemistry and environment.”\n“\"If            it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could            not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications,            my theory would absolutely break down\".\n“For I am            well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume            on which facts cannot be adduced, often apparently leading to conclusions            directly opposite to those at which I arrived.”\n“It occurred            to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made of this question            (the origin of the species) by patiently accumulating and reflecting            on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it”\n“I must begin            with a good body of facts and not from a principle (in which I always            suspect some fallacy) and then as much deduction as you please.”\n“The            belief in God has often been advanced as not only the greatest but the            most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower animals.            It is, however, impossible to maintain that this belief is instinctive            in man. The idea of a universal and beneficent creator does not seem            to arise in the mind of man until he has been elevated by long, continued            culture.”\n \nMount House, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England\nDied 19 April 1882\nDown House, Kent, England\nCharles            Robert Darwin (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English            naturalist who achieved lasting fame by producing considerable evidence            that species originated through evolutionary change, at the same time            proposing the scientific theory that natural selection is the mechanism            by which such change occurs. This theory is now considered a cornerstone            of biology.\nDarwin developed            an interest in natural history while studying first medicine, then theology,            at university. Darwin's observations on his five-year voyage on the            Beagle brought him eminence as a geologist and fame as a popular author.            His biological finds led him to study the transmutation of species and            in 1838 he conceived his theory of natural selection. Fully aware that            others had been severely punished for such \"heretical\" ideas,            he confided only in his closest friends and continued his research to            meet anticipated objections. However, in 1858 the information that Alfred            Russel Wallace had developed a similar theory forced an early joint            publication of the theory.\nHis 1859 book On            the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation            of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (usually abbreviated to The            Origin of Species) established evolution by common descent as the dominant            scientific explanation of diversification in nature. He was made a Fellow            of the Royal Society, continued his research, and wrote a series of            books on plants and animals, including humankind, notably The Descent            of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex and The Expression of the Emotions            in Man and Animals.\nIn recognition of            Darwin's preeminence, he was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to John            Herschel and Isaac Newton.\nThe seven-year-old            Charles Darwin in 1816, one year before the sudden loss of his mother.Main            article: Charles Darwin's education\nCharles Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England on 12 February            1809 at his family home, the Mount House.[1] He was the fifth of six            children of wealthy society doctor Robert Darwin and Susannah Darwin            (née Wedgwood). He was the grandson of Erasmus Darwin on his            father's side, and of Josiah Wedgwood on his mother's side, both from            the Darwin — Wedgwood family, a prominent English family which            supported the Unitarian church. His mother died when he was only eight.            He went to the nearby Shrewsbury School the next year as a boarder.\nIn 1825, after spending            the summer as an apprentice doctor, helping his father with treating            the poor of Shropshire, Darwin went to the University of Edinburgh to            study medicine. However, his revulsion at the brutality of surgery led            him to neglect his medical studies. He learned taxidermy from John Edmonstone,            a freed black slave who told him exciting tales of the South American            rainforest.[2] In Darwin's second year he became active in student societies            for naturalists. He became an avid pupil of Robert Edmund Grant, who            pioneered development of the theories of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and of            Charles' grandfather Erasmus concerning evolution by acquired characteristics.            Darwin took part in Grant's investigations of the life cycle of marine            animals on the shores of the Firth of Forth which found evidence for            homology, the radical theory that all animals have similar organs and            differ only in complexity. In March 1827, Darwin made a presentation            to the Plinian society of his own discovery that the black spores often            found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. He also sat in            on Robert Jameson's natural history course, learning about stratigraphic            geology, receiving training in how to classify plants, and assisting            with work on the extensive collections of the Museum of Edinburgh University,            one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.\nIn 1827, his father,            unhappy that his younger son had no interest in becoming a physician,            shrewdly enrolled him in a Bachelor of Arts course at Christ's College,            University of Cambridge to qualify as a clergyman. This was a sensible career move at a time when many Anglican parsons were provided with            a comfortable income, and when most naturalists in England were clergymen            who saw it as part of their duties to explore the wonders of God's creation.            At Cambridge, Darwin preferred riding and shooting to studying. Along            with his cousin William Darwin Fox, he became engrossed in the craze            at the time for the competitive collecting of beetles, and Fox introduced            him to the Reverend John Stevens Henslow, professor of botany, for expert            advice on beetles. Darwin subsequently joined Henslow's natural history            course, became his favourite pupil and came to be known as \"the            man who walks with Henslow\". When exams began to loom, Darwin focused            more on his studies and received private instruction from Henslow. Darwin            became particularly enthused by the writings of William Paley, including            the argument of divine design in nature. In his finals in January 1831,            he performed well in theology and, having scraped through in classics,            mathematics and physics, came tenth out of a pass list of 178.\nResidential requirements            kept Darwin at Cambridge until June. In keeping with Henslow's example            and advice, he was in no rush to take holy orders. Inspired by Alexander            von Humboldt's Personal Narrative, he planned to visit the Madeira Islands            to study natural history in the tropics with some classmates after graduation.            To prepare himself for this project, Darwin joined the geology course            of the Reverend Adam Sedgwick, a strong proponent of divine design,            then in the summer went with him to assist in mapping strata in Wales.            Darwin was surveying strata on his own when his plans to visit Madeira            were dashed by a message that his intended companion had died, but on            his return home he received another letter. Henslow had recommended            Darwin for the unpaid position of gentleman's companion to Robert FitzRoy,            the captain of HMS Beagle, on a two-year expedition to chart the coastline            of South America which would give Darwin valuable opportunities to develop            his career as a naturalist. His father objected to the voyage, regarding            it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, Josiah            Wedgwood, to agree to his son's participation. This voyage became a            five-year expedition that would lead to dramatic changes in many fields            of science.\nJourney on the Beagle\nAs HMS Beagle surveyed the coasts of South America, Darwin began to            theorise about the wonders of nature around him.The Beagle survey took            five years, two-thirds of which Darwin spent exploring on land. He studied            a rich variety of geological features, fossils and living organisms,            and met a wide range of people, both native and colonial. He methodically            collected an enormous number of specimens, many of them new to science.            This established his reputation as a naturalist and made him one of            the precursors of the field of ecology, particularly the notion of biocoenosis.            His extensive detailed notes showed his gift for theorising and formed            the basis for his later work, as well as providing social, political            and anthropological insights into the areas he visited.\nOn the voyage, Darwin            read Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, which explained geological            features as the outcome of gradual processes over huge periods of time,            and wrote home that he was seeing landforms \"as though he had the            eyes of Lyell\": he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells            in Patagonia as raised beaches; in Chile, he experienced an earthquake            and noted mussel-beds stranded above high tide showing that the land            had been raised; and even high in the Andes, he was able to collect            seashells. He theorised that coral atolls form on sinking volcanic mountains,            an idea he confirmed when the Beagle surveyed the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.\nIn South America            he discovered fossils of gigantic extinct mammals including megatheria            and glyptodons in strata which showed no signs of catastrophe or change            in climate. At the time, he thought them similar to African species,            but after the voyage Richard Owen showed that the remains were of animals            related to living creatures in the same area. In Argentina two species            of rhea had separate but overlapping territories. On the Galápagos            Islands Darwin found that mockingbirds differed from one island to another,            and on returning to Britain he was shown that Galápagos tortoises            and finches were also in distinct species based on the individual islands            they inhabited. The Australian marsupial rat-kangaroo and platypus were            such strikingly unusual animals that on 19 January 1836, in New South            Wales, he recorded this in his journal:\nI had been lying            on a sunny bank & was reflecting on the strange character of the            Animals of this country as compared with the rest of the World. An unbeliever            in every thing beyond his own reason, might exclaim ‘Surely two            distinct Creators must have been [at] work; their object however has            been the same & certainly the end in each case is complete’.\nHe puzzled over            all he saw, and, in the first edition of The Voyage of the Beagle, he            explained species distribution in light of Charles Lyell's ideas of \"centres of creation\". In later editions of this Journal he            foreshadowed his use of Galápagos Islands fauna as evidence for            evolution: \"one might really fancy that from an original paucity            of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified            for different ends.\"\nThree native missionaries            were returned by the Beagle to Tierra del Fuego. They had become \"civilised\" in England over the previous two years, yet their relatives appeared            to Darwin to be \"miserable, degraded savages\". Within a year,            the missionaries had reverted to their harsh previous way of life, yet            they preferred this and did not want to return to England. This experience,            his detestation of the slavery he saw elsewhere in South America, and            other problems he found about such as the effect of European settlement            on aborigines in New Zealand and Australia, persuaded him that there            was no moral justification for the mistreating of others based on the            concept of race. He now thought that humanity was not as far removed            from animals as his clerical friends believed.\nWhile on board the            ship, Darwin suffered from seasickness. In October 1833 he caught a            fever in Argentina, and in July 1834, while returning from the Andes            down to Valparaíso, he fell ill and spent a month in bed. From            1837 onwards Darwin was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms.            These symptoms particularly affected him at times of stress, such as            when attending meetings or dealing with controversy over his theory.            The cause of Darwin's illness was unknown during his lifetime, and attempts            at treatment had little success. Recent speculation has suggested he            caught Chagas disease from insect bites in South America, leading to            the later problems. Other possible causes include psychobiological problems            and Ménière's disease.\nCareer in science,            inception of theory\nWhile still a young man, Charles Darwin joined the scientific élite.While            Darwin was still on the voyage, Henslow carefully fostered his former            pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists access to the fossil            specimens and printed copies of Darwin's geological writings. When the            Beagle returned on 2 October 1836, Darwin was a celebrity in scientific            circles. He visited his home in Shrewsbury and his father organised            investments so that Darwin could become a self-funded gentleman scientist.            Darwin then went to Cambridge and persuaded Henslow to work on botanical            descriptions of modern plants he had collected. Afterwards Darwin went            round the London institutions to find the best naturalists available            to describe his other collections for timely publication. An eager Charles            Lyell met Darwin on 29 October and introduced him to the up-and-coming            anatomist Richard Owen. After working on Darwin's collection of fossil            bones at his Royal College of Surgeons, Owen caused great surprise by            revealing that some were from gigantic extinct rodents and sloths. This            enhanced Darwin's reputation. With Lyell's enthusiastic backing, Darwin            read his first paper to the Geological Society of London on 4 January            1837, arguing that the South American landmass was slowly rising. On            the same day Darwin presented his mammal and bird specimens to the Zoological            Society. The Mammalia were taken on by George R. Waterhouse. Though            the birds seemed almost an afterthought, the ornithologist John Gould            revealed that what Darwin had taken to be wrens, blackbirds and slightly            differing finches from the Galápagos were all finches, but each            was a separate species. Others on the Beagle, including FitzRoy, had            also collected these birds and had been more careful with their notes,            enabling Darwin to determine from which island each species had come.\nIn London, Darwin            stayed with his freethinking brother Erasmus and at dinner parties met            inspiring savants who thought that God preordained life by natural laws            rather than ad hoc miraculous creations. His brother's lady friend Miss            Harriet Martineau was a writer whose stories promoted Malthusian Whig            Poor Law reforms. Scientific circles were buzzing with ideas of transmutation            of species controversially associated with Radical unrest. Darwin preferred            the respectability of his friends the Cambridge Dons, even though his            ideas were pushing beyond their belief that natural history must justify            religion and social order.\nDarwin's first            sketch of an evolutionary tree from his First Notebook on Transmutation            of Species (1837)On 17 February 1837, Lyell used his presidential address            at the Geographical Society to present Owen's findings to date on Darwin's            fossils, noting particularly the unexpected implication that extinct            species were related to current species in the same locality. At the            same meeting Darwin was elected to the Council of the Society. He had            already been invited by FitzRoy to contribute a Journal based on his            field notes as the natural history section of the captain's account            of the Beagle's voyage. He now plunged into writing a book on South            American Geology. At the same time he speculated on transmutation in            his Red Notebook which he had begun on the Beagle. Another project he            started was getting the expert reports on his collection published as            a multivolume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and Henslow used            his contacts to arrange a Treasury grant of £1,000 to sponsor            this. Darwin finished writing his Journal around 20 June when King William            IV died and the Victorian era began. In mid-July he began his secret \"B\" notebook on transmutation, and developed the hypothesis            that where every island in the Galápagos Archipelago had its            own kind of tortoise, these had originated from a single tortoise species            and had adapted to life on the different islands in different ways.\nUnder pressure with            organising Zoology and correcting proofs of his Journal, Darwin's health            suffered. On 20 September 1837 he suffered \"palpitations of the            heart\" and left for a month of recuperation in the country. He            visited Maer Hall where his invalid aunt was being cared for by her            spinster daughter Emma Wedgwood, and entertained his relatives with            tales of his travels. His uncle Jos pointed out an area of ground where            cinders had disappeared under loam and suggested that this might have            been the work of earthworms. This led Darwin to the idea for a talk which he gave to the Geological Society on 1 November, on the unusually            mundane subject of worm casts. This work is considered to be the first            scholarly treatment of soil forming processes. He had avoided taking            on official posts which would have taken up valuable time, but by March            William Whewell had recruited him as Secretary of the Geological Society.            Illness prompted Darwin to take a break from the pressure of work and            he went \"geologising\" in Scotland. In glorious weather he            visited Glen Roy to see the phenomenon known as \"roads\" which            he (incorrectly) identified as raised beaches.\nCharles chose            to marry his cousin, Emma Wedgwood.Fully recuperated, he returned home            to Shrewsbury. Scientifically pondering his career and prospects he            drew up a list with columns headed \"Marry\" and \"Not Marry\".            Entries in the pro-marriage column included \"constant companion            and a friend in old age ... better than a dog anyhow,\" while listed            among the cons were \"less money for books\" and \"terrible            loss of time.\" The pros won out. He discussed the prospect of marriage            with his father then went to visit his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838.            He did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice            he told her of his ideas on transmutation. While his thoughts and work            continued in London over the autumn he suffered repeated bouts of illness.            On 11 November he returned and proposed to Emma, once more telling her            his ideas. She accepted, but later wrote beseeching him to read from            the Gospel of St. John a section on love and following the Way which            also states that \"If a man abide not in me...they are burned\". He sent a warm reply which eased her concern, but she would continue            to worry that his lapses of faith could endanger her hope that they            would meet in afterlife.\nDarwin considered            Malthus's argument that human population increases more quickly than            food production, leaving people competing for food and making charity            useless. He later formulated this in the terms of his biological theory            as: \"Man tends to increase at a greater rate than his means of            subsistence; consequently he is occasionally subjected to a severe struggle            for existence, and natural selection will have effected whatever lies            within its scope.\" (Descent of Man, Ch.21) He related this to the            findings about species relating to localities, his enquiries into animal            breeding, and ideas of Natural \"laws of harmony\". Towards            the end of November 1838 he compared breeders selecting traits to a            Malthusian Nature selecting from variants thrown up by \"chance\" so that \"every part of newly acquired structure is fully practised            and perfected\", and thought this \"the most beautiful part            of my theory\" of how species originated. He went house-hunting            and eventually found \"Macaw Cottage\" in Gower Street, London,            then moved his \"museum\" in over Christmas. He was showing            the stress, and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically            remarking \"So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can            be with you to nurse you.\" On 24 January 1839 he was honoured by            being elected as Fellow of the Royal Society and presented his paper            on the Roads of Glen Roy.\nMarriage and children\nDarwin in 1842 with his eldest son, William Erasmus Darwin.On 29 January            1839, Darwin married his cousin Emma Wedgwood at Maer in an Anglican            ceremony arranged to also suit the Unitarians. After first living in            Gower Street, London, the couple moved on 17 September 1842 to Down            House in Downe. The Darwins had ten children, three of whom died early.            Many of his surviving children and their grandchildren would later achieve            notability themselves (see Darwin — Wedgwood family)\nSeveral of their            children suffered illness or weaknesses, and Charles Darwin's fear that            this might be due to the closeness of his and Emma's lineage was expressed            in his writings on the ill effects of inbreeding and advantages of crossing.\nDevelopment of theory\nMain article: Development of Darwin's theory\nDarwin was now an eminent geologist in the scientific élite of            clerical naturalists, settled with a private income, while privately            working on his theory. He had a vast amount of work to do, writing up            all his findings and supervising the preparation of the multivolume            Zoology, which would describe his collections. He embarked on extensive            experiments with plants and consultations with animal husbanders, including            pigeon and pig breeders, trying to find soundly based answers to all            the arguments he anticipated when he presented his theory in public.\nWhen FitzRoy's account            was published in May 1839, Darwin's Journal and Remarks was a great            success. Later that year it was published on its own, becoming the bestseller            today known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In December 1839, as Emma's            first pregnancy progressed, Darwin suffered more illness and accomplished            little during the following year.\nDarwin tried to            explain his theory to close friends, but they were slow to show interest            and thought that selection must need a divine selector. In 1842 the            family moved to rural Down House to escape the pressures of London.            Darwin formulated a short \"Pencil Sketch\" of his theory, and            by 1844 had written a 240-page \"Essay\" that expanded his early            ideas on natural selection. Darwin completed his third Geological book            in 1846. Assisted by his friend, the young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker,            he embarked on a huge study of barnacles. In 1847, Hooker read the \"Essay\" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback            that he needed.\nDarwin feared putting            the theory out in an incomplete form, as his ideas about evolution would            be highly controversial if any attention was paid to them at all. Other            ideas about evolution — especially the work of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck — had been soundly dismissed by the British scientific community,            and were associated with political radicalism. The anonymous publication            of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844 created another            controversy over radicalism and evolution, and was severely attacked            by Darwin's friends who stressed that no reputable scientist would want            to be associated with such ideas.\nTo try to deal with            his illness, Darwin went to a spa in Malvern in 1849, and to his surprise            found that the two months of water treatment helped. In his work on            barnacles he found \"homologies\" that supported his theory            by showing that slightly changed body parts could serve different functions            to meet new conditions. Then his treasured daughter Annie fell ill,            reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary. After a            long series of crises, she died and Darwin lost all faith in a beneficent            God.\nHe met the young            freethinking naturalist Thomas Huxley who was to become a close friend            and ally. Darwin's work on barnacles (Cirripedia) earned him the Royal            Society's Royal Medal in 1853, establishing his reputation as a biologist.            He completed this study in 1854 and turned his attention to his theory            of species.\nAnnouncement and            publication of theory\nDarwin was forced into early publication of his theory of natural selection.Main            article: Publication of Darwin's theory\nDarwin found an answer to the problem of how genera forked in an analogy            with industrial ideas of division of labour, with specialised varieties            each finding their niche so that species could diverge. He experimented            with seeds, testing their ability to survive sea-water to transfer species            to isolated islands, and bred pigeons to test his ideas of natural selection            being comparable to the \"artificial selection\" used by pigeon            breeders.\nIn the spring of            1856, Lyell read a paper on the Introduction of species by Alfred Russel            Wallace, a naturalist working in Borneo. Lyell urged Darwin to publish            his theory to establish precedence. Despite illness, Darwin began a            3-volume book titled Natural Selection, getting specimens and information            from naturalists including Wallace and Asa Gray. In December 1857 as            Darwin worked on the book he received a letter from Wallace asking if            it would delve into human origins. Sensitive to Lyell's fears, Darwin            responded that \"I think I shall avoid the whole subject, as so            surrounded with prejudices, though I fully admit that it is the highest & most interesting problem for the naturalist.\" He encouraged            Wallace's theorising, saying \"without speculation there is no good & original observation.\" Darwin added that \"I go much            further than you.\" His manuscript reached 250,000 words, then on            18 June 1858 he received a paper in which Wallace described the evolutionary            mechanism and requested him to send it on to Lyell. Darwin did so, shocked            that he had been \"forestalled\". Though Wallace had not asked            for publication, Darwin offered to send it to any journal that Wallace            chose. He put matters in the hands of Lyell and Hooker. They agreed            on a joint presentation at the Linnean Society on 1 July of On the Tendency            of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and            Species by Natural Means of Selection. Darwin's infant son died and            he was unable to attend.\nThe initial announcement            of the theory gained little immediate attention. It was mentioned briefly            in a few small reviews, but to most people it seemed much the same as            other varieties of evolutionary thought. For the next thirteen months            Darwin suffered from ill health and struggled to produce an abstract            of his \"big book on species\". Receiving constant encouragement            from his scientific friends, Darwin finally finished his abstract and            Lyell arranged to have it published by John Murray. The title was agreed            as On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, and when            the book went on sale to the trade on 22 November 1859, the stock of            1,250 copies was oversubscribed. At the time \"Evolutionism\" implied creation without divine intervention, and Darwin avoided using            the words \"evolution\" or \"evolve\", though the book            ends by stating that \"endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful            have been, and are being, evolved.\" The book only briefly alluded            to the idea that human beings, too, would evolve in the same way as            other organisms. Darwin wrote in deliberate understatement that \"light            will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"\nReaction\nA typical satire was the later caricature in Hornet magazine portraying            Darwin as a non-human ape.Darwin's book set off a public controversy            which he monitored closely, keeping press cuttings of thousands of reviews,            articles, satires, parodies and caricatures. Reviewers were quick to            pick out the unstated implications of \"men from monkeys\",            though a Unitarian review was favourable and The Times published a glowing            review by Huxley which included swipes at Richard Owen, leader of the            scientific establishment Huxley was trying to overthrow. Owen initially            appeared neutral, but then wrote a review condemning the book.\nThe Church of England            scientific establishment including Darwin's old Cambridge tutors Sedgwick            and Henslow reacted against the book, though it was well received by            a younger generation of professional naturalists. Then Essays and Reviews            by seven liberal Anglican theologians declared that miracles were irrational            (and supported the Origin), distracting attention away from Darwin.\nThe most famous            confrontation took place at a meeting of the British Association for            the Advancement of Science in Oxford. Professor John William Draper            delivered a long lecture about Darwin and social progress, then Samuel            Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, argued against Darwin. In the ensuing            debate Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin and Thomas Huxley established            himself as \"Darwin's bulldog\" – the fiercest defender            of evolutionary theory on the Victorian stage. The story is that on            being asked by Wilberforce whether he was descended from monkeys on            his grandfather's side or his grandmother's side, Huxley muttered: \"The            Lord has delivered him into my hands\" and replied that he \"would            rather be descended from an ape than from a cultivated man who used            his gifts of culture and eloquence in the service of prejudice and falsehood\" (this is contested[3]). The story spread around the country: Huxley            had said he would rather be an ape than a Bishop.\nMany people felt            that Darwin's view of nature destroyed the important distinction between            man and beast. Darwin himself did not personally defend his theories            in public, though he read eagerly about the continuing debates. He was            frequently very ill, and mustered support through letters and correspondence.            A core circle of scientific friends – Huxley, Hooker, Charles            Lyell and Asa Gray – actively pushed his work to the fore of the            scientific and public stage, defending him against his many critics            in this key scientific controversy of the era, and helping to gain him            the honour of the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1864. Darwin's theory            also resonated with various movements at the time and became a key fixture            of popular culture. The book was translated into many languages and            went through numerous reprints. It became a staple scientific text accessible            both to a newly curious middle class and to \"working men\",            and was hailed as the most controversial and discussed scientific book            ever written.\nFurther experiments,            research and writing\nJulia Margaret Cameron's portrait of Darwin.Despite repeated bouts of            illness during the last twenty-two years of his life Darwin pressed            on with his work. He had published an abstract of his theory, but more            controversial aspects of his \"big book\" were still incomplete.            These included explicit evidence of humankind's descent from earlier            animals, and exploration of possible causes underlying the development            of society and of human mental abilities. He had yet to explain features            with no obvious utility other than decorative beauty. His experiments,            research and writing continued.\nWhen Darwin's daughter            fell ill he set aside his experiments with seedlings and domestic animals            to go with her to a seaside resort where he became interested in wild            orchids. This developed into an innovative study of how their beautiful            flowers served to control insect pollination and ensure cross fertilisation.            As with the barnacles, homologous parts served different functions in            different species. Back at home he lay on his sickbed in a room filled            with experiments on climbing plants. He was visited by a reverent Ernst            Haeckel who had spread the gospel of Darwinismus in Germany. Even at            Cambridge, students now supported his ideas. Huxley gave \"working-men's            lectures\" to widen the audience, and Wallace remained a supporter            but increasingly turned to spiritualism. Variation grew to two huge            volumes, forcing him to leave out humankind and sexual selection, but            when printed was in huge demand.\nThe question of            human evolution had been taken up by his supporters (and detractors)            shortly after the publication of The Origin of Species, but Darwin's            own contribution to the subject came more than ten years later with            the two-volume The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex            published in 1871. In the second volume, Darwin introduced in full his            concept of sexual selection to explain the evolution of human culture,            the differences between the human sexes, and the differentiation of            human races, as well as the beautiful (and seemingly non-adaptive) plumage            of birds. A year later Darwin published his last major work, The Expression            of the Emotions in Man and Animals, which focused on the evolution of            human psychology and its continuity with to the behaviour of animals.            He developed his ideas that the human mind and cultures were developed            by natural and sexual selection, an approach which has been revived            in the last two decades with the emergence of evolutionary psychology.            As he concluded in Descent of Man, Darwin felt that despite all of humankind's \"noble qualities\" and \"exalted powers\":\n\"Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.\"\nHis evolution-related experiments and investigations culminated in five            books on plants, and then his last book returned to the effect worms            have on soil levels.\nDarwin died in Downe,            Kent, England, on 19 April 1882. He had expected to be buried in St            Mary's churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues,            William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin            to be given a state funeral and buried in Westminster Abbey.\nReligious views\nThe 1851 death of Darwin's daughter, Annie, was the final step in pushing            an already doubting Darwin away from the idea of a beneficent God.Charles            Darwin came from a Nonconformist background. Though several members            of his family were Freethinkers, openly lacking conventional religious            beliefs, he did not initially doubt the literal truth of the Bible.            He attended a Church of England school, then at Cambridge studied Anglican            theology to become a clergyman and was fully convinced by William Paley's            teleological argument that design in nature proved the existence of            God. However, his beliefs began to shift during his time on board HMS            Beagle. He questioned what he saw—wondering, for example, at beautiful            deep-ocean creatures created where no one could see them, and shuddering            at the sight of a wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its            eggs; he saw the latter as contradicting Paley's vision of beneficent            design. While on the Beagle Darwin was quite orthodox and would quote            the Bible as an authority on morality, but had come to see the history            in the Old Testament as being false and untrustworthy.\nUpon his return,            he investigated transmutation of species. He knew that his clerical            naturalist friends thought this a bestial heresy undermining miraculous            justifications for the social order and knew that such revolutionary            ideas were especially unwelcome at a time when the Church of England's            established position was under attack from radical Dissenters and atheists.            While secretly developing his theory of natural selection, Darwin even            wrote of religion as a tribal survival strategy, though he still believed            that God was the ultimate lawgiver.[4] His belief continued to dwindle            over the time, and with the death of his daughter Annie in 1851, Darwin            finally lost all faith in Christianity. He continued to give support            to the local church and help with parish work, but on Sundays would            go for a walk while his family attended church. In later life, when            asked about his religious views, he wrote that he had never been an            atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God, and that generally \"an Agnostic would be the more correct description of my state            of mind.\"[5]\nCharles Darwin recounted            in his biography of his grandfather Erasmus Darwin how false stories            were circulated claiming that Erasmus had called for Jesus on his deathbed.            Charles concluded by writing \"Such was the state of Christian feeling            in this country [in 1802].... We may at least hope that nothing of the            kind now prevails.\" Despite this hope, very similar stories were            circulated following Darwin's own death, most prominently the \"Lady            Hope Story\", published in 1915 which claimed he had converted on            his sickbed.[6] Such stories have been propagated by some Christian            groups, to the extent of becoming urban legends, though the claims were            refuted by Darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.            His daughter, Henrietta, who was at his deathbed, said that he did not            convert to Christianity.[7]\nLegacy\nCharles Darwin's contributions to evolutionary thought had an enormous            effect on many fields of science.Charles Darwin's theory that evolution            occurred through natural selection changed the thinking of countless            fields of study from biology to anthropology. His work established that \"evolution\" had occurred: not necessarily that it was by natural            or sexual selection (this particular recognition would not become fully            standard until the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work in the early            20th century and the creation of the modern synthesis). Others before            him had outlined the idea of natural selection: in his lifetime Darwin            acknowledged the earlier writings of William Charles Wells and Patrick            Matthew which he (and practically all other naturalists) had been unaware            of when publishing his theory. However, it is clear that Darwin was            the first to develop and publish a scientific theory of natural selection,            and that the alleged predecessors did not contribute to the development            or success of natural selection as a theory in science.\nDarwin's work was            extremely controversial at the time he published it and many during            his time did not take it seriously. Evolution by natural selection proved            to be a significant blow to notions of divine creation and intelligent design prevalent in 19th-century science, specifically overturning the            Creation biology doctrine of \"created kinds\". The idea that            there was no line to be drawn between human beings, races, and animals            would forever make Darwin a symbol of iconoclasm who removed humanity's            privileged place in the universe. To some of his detractors, Darwin            would be \"the monkey man\", often depicted as part ape. His            ideas also stood in opposition to the more common beliefs at the time            that the human races had developed separately or that one race was superior            by virtue of biology than another.\nEugenics\nFollowing Darwin's publication of the Origin his cousin Francis Galton            applied the concepts to human society, producing ideas to promote \"hereditary            improvement\" starting in 1865 and elaborated at length in 1869.            In The Descent of Man Darwin agreed that Galton had demonstrated that \"talent\" and \"genius\" in humans were probably inherited,            but thought that the social changes Galton proposed were too \"utopian\".            Neither Galton nor Darwin supported government intervention and instead            believed that, at most, heredity should be taken into consideration            by people seeking potential mates. In 1883, after Darwin's death, Galton            began calling his social philosophy Eugenics. In the twentieth century,            eugenics movements gained popularity in a number of countries and became            associated with reproduction control programmes such as compulsory sterilisation            laws, then were stigmatised after their usage in the rhetoric of Nazi            Germany in its goals of genetic \"purity\".\nSocial Darwinism\nIn 1944 the American historian Richard Hofstadter applied the term \"Social            Darwinism\" to describe 19th- and 20th-century thinking developed            from the ideas of Thomas Malthus and Herbert Spencer, which applied            ideas of evolution and \"survival of the fittest\" to societies            or nations competing for survival in a hostile world. These ideas became            discredited by association with racism and imperialism. Though the term            is anachronistic, in Darwin's day the difference between what was later            called \"Social Darwinism\" and simple \"Darwinism\" was less clear. However, Darwin did not believe that his scientific            theory mandated any particular theory of governance or social order.            Indeed, he believed that sympathy should be extended to all races and            nations.\nThe use of the phrase \"Social Darwinism\" to describe Malthus's ideas is particularly            disingenuous, since Malthus died in 1834 before the inception of Darwin's            theory was spurred by his reading the 6th edition of Malthus' famous            Essay on a Principle of Population in 1838. Spencer's evolutionary \"progressivism\" and his social and political ideas were largely Malthusian, and his            books on economics of 1851 and on evolution of 1855 predated Darwin's            publication of the Origin in 1859.\nCharles Darwin was            born on Feb. 12, 1809, The Mount, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Eng. d. April            19, 1882, Down House, Downe, Kent. His full name is Charles Rbert Darwin.\nDarwin was an English            naturalist renowned for his documentation of evolution and for his theory            of its operation, known as Darwinism. His evolutionary theories, propounded            chiefly in two works--On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection            (1859) and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871)--have            had a profound influence on subsequent scientific thought.\nDarwin was the son            of Robert Waring Darwin, who had one of the largest medical practices            outside of London, and the grandson of the physician Erasmus Darwin,            the author of Zoonomia, or the Laws of Organic Life, and of the artisan-entrepreneur            Josiah Wedgwood. Darwin thus enjoyed a secure position in the professional            upper middle class that provided him with considerable social and professional            advantages.\nYouth and Education\nDarwin's mother            died when he was eight years old. Otherwise he enjoyed a golden childhood,            cosseted and encouraged by adoring sisters, an older brother, and the            large Darwin and Wedgwood clans. He was keenly interested in specimen            collecting and chemical investigations, but at the Shrewsbury school,            where he was an uninspired student, the headmaster, Dr. Samuel Butler,            stressed the classics and publicly rebuked Darwin for wasting his time            with chemical experiments.\nAt age 16 he was            sent to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he was            repelled by surgery performed without anesthetics. During his two years            in Scotland Darwin benefited from friendships with the zoologist Robert            Grant, who introduced him to the study of marine animals, and the geologist            Robert Jameson, who fed his growing interest in the history of the Earth.\nDisappointed by            Darwin's lack of enthusiasm for medicine, his father sent him to the            University of Cambridge in 1827 to study divinity. At the time Darwin            adhered to the conventional beliefs of the Church of England. His academic            record at Christ's College was as undistinguished as it had been at            Edinburgh.\nHe socialized considerably            with hunting, shooting, riding, and sporting friends. Cambridge did            not yet offer a degree in the natural sciences, but, guided by his older            cousin William Darwin Fox (an entomologist who inspired in him a lifelong            passion for collecting beetles), Darwin met the circle of Cambridge            scientists led by the cleric-botanist John Stevens Henslow.\nSoon a regular at            Henslow's \"open houses,\" Darwin accompanied him on daily walks            and became known as \"the man who walks with Henslow.\" Henslow            encouraged Darwin's excitement about science and confidence in his own            abilities.\nOn leaving Cambridge            in the spring of 1831 Darwin, in preparation for a scientific trip to            the Canary Islands, read Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative            of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent, a scientific            travelogue of a journey to Central and the northern parts of South America.            At Henslow's recommendation he accompanied Adam Sedgwick, Woodwardian            professor of geology at Cambridge, on a three-week tour of North Wales            to learn geologic fieldwork.\nIn August 1831,            at Henslow's recommendation to the Admiralty, Darwin was invited to            sail as the unpaid naturalist on HMS Beagle. The ship was to survey            the east and west coasts of South America and continue to the Pacific            islands to establish a chain of chronometric stations.\nHenslow suggested            Darwin as both an acute observer and a companion for the aristocratic            young captain, Robert FitzRoy. (The Beagle already had a naturalist-surgeon,            but one whom FitzRoy found socially unsuitable.) Robert Darwin first            refused permission on grounds that it was dangerous and would not advance            Charles in his career. But upon the intercession of his brother-in-law,            Josiah Wedgwood II, he changed his mind.\nOn Dec. 27, 1831,            Charles Darwin sailed from Plymouth, Eng., on the Beagle, a 10-gun brig            that had been refitted as a three-masted bark. The voyage, planned for            two years, lasted five, during which Darwin kept meticulous notes and            sent back geologic and biologic specimens.\nThe Voyage of the \"Beagle\"\nIn a letter to FitzRoy            accepting the post Darwin explained that he expected the voyage to be            a \"second birth.\"\nThere is no doubt            that the years he spent exploring the South American continent and the            offshore islands of the Galapagos honed his skills as a collector, observer,            and theorist.\nOften seasick, Darwin            rested horizontally in a hammock during the worst motion and spent long            periods of time ashore whenever the opportunity arose. He delighted            in the exotica of the tropics.\nAdventurous, he            braved his way through armed political rebellions, rode with the gauchos            in Argentina, and on collecting and shooting expeditions justified his            earlier devotion to sport.\nHe joined the crew            in towing the ship's boats upstream and once rescued the expedition            by running to save a boat from a tidal wave. He seemed to relish danger            and was sustained in the considerable discomfort by a lively curiosity.\nHe wrote to one            of his sisters\n\"We have in            truth the world before us. Think of the Andes; the luxuriant forest            of the Guayquil, the islands of the South Sea & New South Wales.            How many magnificent & characteristic views, how many and curious            tribes of men we shall see. What fine opportunities for geology and            studying the infinite host of living beings: Is this not a prospect            to keep up the most flagging spirit?\"\nDarwin had brought his own books to augment the ship's extensive library.            The most important scientific work was the first volume of Charles Lyell's            Principles of Geology, which Henslow had urged him to read though not            to believe.\nLyell argued that            the face of the Earth had changed gradually over long periods of time            through the continuing, cumulative effects of local disturbances, such            as eruptions, earthquakes, erosion, and deposition.\nSuch disturbances            had existed in the distant past and could be observed in the present.            This view differed dramatically from that held by most contemporary            geologists, who hewed to the belief that changes in the face of the            Earth resulted from short- lived events of great violence that could            raise mountains or flood the entire planet. During the first months            of his journey Darwin was converted to Lyell's views by his own observations.\nAbout 1,800 miles            southwest of the Canary Islands the Beagle visited São Tiago,            a volcanic island in the Cape Verde Islands. From the harbour Darwin            saw a band of white rock extending horizontally at a height of about            45 feet above the base of the sea cliffs. The formation was calcareous            and contained numerous shells, almost all of which could be found on            the coast.\nDarwin reasoned            that a stream of lava from the ancient volcanoes had flowed over what            had been ancient seabed, baking it to form the hard white rock. The            whole island had subsequently been heaved up to make the sea cliff from            the white band downward. Darwin also realized that the island's surface            had been formed by a succession of volcanic events, not a single dramatic            one. He discerned an initial subsidence, the settling of the surface            around the original craters, its building up from new lava spills from            different craters, and further subsidence and building up over a long            period of time.\nLater, in Chile,            Darwin witnessed his first earthquake. He saw the land rise before his            eyes. Then, after crossing the Andes in 1835, he wrote to his sister            that he could understand \"to a certain extent the description & manner of the force, which has elevated this great line of mountains.\"\nHe had found fossil            shells at an elevation of 12,000 feet, and he theorized that a chain            of suboceanic volcanoes had poured forth enormous quantities of lava            that formed the Andes through a further process of upheaval and fracturing.\nDarwin marveled            at the whole South American continent, which he read as a vast testing            ground for Lyell's ideas. To his cousin William Fox he wrote, \"Everything            in America is on such a grand scale. The same formations extend for            5 or 600 miles without the slightest change--for such geology one requires            6 league boots.\"\nThe data Darwin            collected on the Beagle provided him with material for three books on            South American geology.\nAlthough his theories            of continental change have been superseded by the theory of plate tectonics,            his descriptions in letters to Henslow, which Henslow excerpted and            read before the Cambridge Philosophical Society and the Geological Society            of London, brought him celebrity in scientific circles even before his            return.\nWhile still on the            voyage he challenged Lyell's view of the formation of coral reefs by            volcanic action. Darwin contended that the reefs were part of a process            of gradual changes in the Earth's crust resulting from the subsidence            of some landmasses and corresponding elevations elsewhere. He explained            that coral, which only grows in shallow waters, forms a reef by building            up on the seafloor as the floor subsides.\nHe predicted that            if a whole island sank below the ocean's surface, and the coral continued            to grow, a reef would turn into an atoll around a lagoon. Lyell was            convinced and supported Darwin's reinterpretation, which deep-sea borings            in the 20th century have confirmed.\nDarwin's geologic            ponderings were important for geology and to his scientific development.            Many of the rocks he examined contained fossils, and his constant exposure            to the evidence of extinct species and the similarity of many of them            to living species kept one problem at the fore: By what mechanism did            new species replace extinct ones?\nDuring the voyage            Darwin developed confidence in his own observations as well as the ability            to grasp a problem and work at it steadily. The isolation of the voyage,            combined with the exposure to new phenomena, taught him to think for            himself within the familiar scientific culture of his time.\nHe developed a rare            combination of strengths: a dedication to careful fact gathering and            a propensity to theorize about the facts. His geologic pondering on            a continental scale encouraged him to search for universal laws. The            voyage of the Beagle transformed Darwin into an independent and adventurous            scientist who had the courage to embrace the heretical idea of the transmutation            of species.\nOn the Origin of            Species\nWhen Darwin returned            to England in 1836 he was welcomed by the scientific fraternity as a            colleague and was promptly made a fellow of the Geological Society.            The next year he was elected to its governing council.\nIn 1838 Darwin was            elected to the Athenaeum, the exclusive club for men distinguished in            literature, art, or science, and in 1839 he was elected to the Royal            Society. Through his older brother, Erasmus, he met the historian Thomas            Carlyle and the feminist Harriet Martineau. He was also a friend of            Charles Babbage, whose computing machine was one of a host of scientific            interests.\nAt this time, however,            Darwin began to lead something of a double life. To the world he was            busy preparing his Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural            History of the Various Countries Visited by H.M.S. Beagle, which was            published in 1839.\nThis book, modeled            in part on von Humboldt's, established the lucid style enlivened by            the sharp descriptions that makes all of Darwin's works both accessible            and convincing.\nDarwin was also            preparing his geology books and superintending the analysis and publication            by specialists of The Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle (published            between 1839 and 1843 with the help of a £1,000 government grant).\nPrivately Darwin            had begun a remarkable series of notebooks in which he initiated a set            of questions and answers about \"the species problem.\" He proceeded            to collect facts about species through letters and discussions with            breeders, gardeners, naturalists, and zookeepers, as well as through            extensive reading.\nDarwin kept this            interest secret while he gathered evidence to substantiate his theory            of organic evolution. He was mindful of the fate of other unorthodox            scientists. He jotted in his notebook, \"Mention persecution of            early astronomers--then add chief good of individual scientific men,            is to push their science a few years in advance only of their age.\"\nDarwin's ideas were            not only scientifically radical but also could have been interpreted            as actionable under the laws governing blasphemy and sedition.\nEngland at the time            was intensely evangelical, and the natural world was understood as one            in which the spirit of God could be seen in the creation of new species            of plants and animals that appeared to come into existence to replace            those that became extinct. Darwin gradually became intellectually uncomfortable            with this view of life as he confronted puzzling evidence.\nUpon his return            from the voyage Darwin had turned over his specimens to cataloging experts            in Cambridge and London. In South America he had found fossils of extinct            armadillos that were similar but not identical to the living animals.\nArgentina he had            seen species vary geographically; for example, the giant ostriches (rheas)            on the pampas were replaced to the south in Patagonia by much smaller            species, both of which were akin to but different from the African ostrich.\nHe had been disturbed            by the fact that the birds and tortoises of the Galápagos Islands            off the western coast of Ecuador tended to resemble species found on            the nearby continent, while inhabitants of similar neighbouring islands            in the Galapagos had quite different animal populations.\nIn London Darwin            learned that the finches he had brought from the Galápagos belonged            to different species, not merely different varieties, as he had originally            believed. He also learned that the mockingbirds were of three distinct            species and that the Galapagos tortoises represented at least two species            and that, like many of the specimens from the archipelago, they were            native to the islands but to neither of the American continents.\nAfter Darwin received            these reports, his doubts about the fixity of species crystallized into            a belief in transmutation. In March 1837 he confided in his notebook            that species changed from one place to another or from one era to the            next. He continued analyzing his data, searching for a mechanism for            this process.\nThen in October            1838 Darwin read Thomas Malthus' An Essay on the Principle of Population.            Malthus argued that population growth is geometric, while the food supply            increases only arithmetically, and thus that population increase is            always checked by a limited food supply.\nDarwin recalled            in his Autobiography his realization that given the struggle for existence            everywhere, \"favourable variations would tend to be preserved,            and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. . . . The result of this would            be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory\"--the            principle of natural selection--\"by which to work.\"\nDarwin's originality            extended beyond perceiving the savagery of the natural world. Other            scientists and philosophers had noted the brutality of species against            species, of the lion devouring the lamb.\nDarwin saw competition            between individuals of a single species. He recognized that within a            local population the individual with, for example, the sharper beak,            the longer horn, or the brighter feather might have a better chance            to survive and reproduce than other individuals. If such advantageous            traits were passed on to new generations, they would eventually be predominant            in future populations.\nDarwin thus shifted            the focus of evolutionary analysis from between to within species. He            saw natural selection as the mechanism by which advantageous variations            passed on to succeeding generations and by which the traits of individuals            that were less competitive gradually disappeared from populations. (Later            generations of biologists came to understand variations within a species            as variations in the genes of its individual members, and they explained            evolution as the action of natural selection upon genes responsible            for advantageous traits.)\nAfter he had hit            upon natural selection, Darwin was eager to verify it, and he stepped            up his inquiries to plant and animal breeders. He hoped to learn from            their experience with artificial selection how natural selection worked.\nDarwin still faced            the problem of divergence--that is, the evolutionary development of            dissimilar characteristics in closely related species that have descended            from a single organic ancestor. As he had observed during his voyage,            divergent species appeared on different landmasses.\nDarwin solved this            puzzle of geographic distribution by assigning the dissemination of            populations of ocean islands to the power of wind and water. The theory            of the evolution of species thus solved many puzzles in comparative            anatomy, embryology, and paleontology. (For further discussion of the            details of Darwin's theory, see evolution; for details of the evolution            of humans, see human evolution.)\nThe idea of organic            evolution was not new. It had been suggested a generation earlier by            Erasmus Darwin and in France by Buffon, Montesquieu, Maupertuis, Diderot,            and most recently Lamarck. Lamarck had drawn the first evolutionary            diagram--a ladder leading from unicellular organisms to man.\nBut none of these            earlier evolutionists had presented either a mechanism or persuasive            evidence for the process. Lamarck offered the hypothesis that spontaneous generation occurs constantly, that organisms possess an \"inner            feeling\" toward perfection, and that the traits an animal acquires            to adapt to a changing environment are passed on to its descendants.\nThough lack of an            apparent mechanism of inheritance eventually prompted him to accept            the latter idea, Darwin's theory was rooted in direct observation and            an attempt to discover universal laws. His evolutionary sketch was a            branching tree, not a single ladder.\nAbove all, Darwin            rejected the prevailing view that organisms are perfectly adapted to            their environment. He viewed the natural world, instead, as caught in            an incessant struggle between competing individuals that have different            degrees of fitness. Others had seen struggles but always between species,            never within them.\nBy moving the battle            from interspecies struggles to intraspecies competition, Darwin introduced            the concept of populations--that is, localized groups consisting of            members of a given species in which each individual differs from its            sibling. He recognized that it is the competition within a species leading            to the survival of individuals with adaptationally advantageous traits            that eventually brings about the evolution of a new species.\nBy 1842 Darwin was            confident enough in his theory to draft a short sketch, and in 1844            he composed a longer version, which he showed to his friend, the botanist            Joseph Dalton Hooker. Wary of presenting his theory to the public, Darwin            spent the next decade concentrating on a treatise on barnacles, in which            he hinted but did not actually say that species were the product of            natural selection. In the meantime the intellectual atmosphere in England            altered and discussions about evolution became commonplace.\nDarwin still withheld            publishing his thesis. When he would have determined that the time was            ripe is impossible to know, but the decision was removed from him when            on June 18, 1858, he received from Alfred Russel Wallace, a naturalist            working in the Malay Archipelago, a paper that perfectly summarized            the theory that Darwin had been elaborating for 20 years.\nDisheartened by            this apparent preemption of his life's work, Darwin was saved by his            friends and confidants, Lyell, Hooker, and T.H. Huxley, who arranged            for a joint paper by Darwin and Wallace to be read to the Linnean Society            of London on July 1, 1858.\nDarwin then began            work on what he called an \"abstract\" of the larger manuscript            that he had begun two years earlier. This abstract, On the Origin of            Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation of Favoured            Races in the Struggle for Life, was published on Nov. 24, 1859.\nThe first edition            sold out immediately, and by 1872 the work had run through six editions.            The theory was accepted quickly in most scientific circles. With the            exception of holdouts like his old colleague Adam Sedgwick and individuals            such as the biologist Richard Owen, who attacked Darwin personally,            most opposition was from the clergy.\nThey realized that            the theory of evolution was inconsistent with a literal interpretation            of the book of Genesis. Orthodox Christians felt threatened by the suggestion            that the natural (or living) world worked according to laws as did the            physical world.\nThere was no place            in Darwin's world for divine intervention, nor was mankind placed in            a position of superiority vis-à-vis the rest of the animal world.            Darwin saw man as part of a continuum with the rest of nature, not separated            by divine injunction.\nAfter the publication            of the Origin, Darwin continued to write, while friends, especially            Huxley, defended the theory before the public.\nIn June 1860 at            the Oxford meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of            Science, Huxley confronted the bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce,            who had been coached by Richard Owen. Wilberforce patronized Huxley,            asking whether it was through his father or his mother that he was descended            from an ape.\nHuxley replied that            he was not ashamed of having descended from an ape but would be ashamed            of an ancestor who used gifts of eloquence in the service of falsehoods.            Huxley and Hooker annihilated Wilberforce's position at the Oxford debate            and continued spreading what was tantamount to a gospel of evolution.\nDarwin completed            the elucidation of his theory in his next three books, which were all            continuations of the Origin. In The Variation of Animals and Plants            Under Domestication (1868), Darwin proposed his hypothesis of pangenesis            (an ill-founded attempt to account for the acquisition of hereditary            characteristics, a process eventually explained in the development of            cell biology and genetics).\nDarwin met the issue            of human evolution head-on in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation            to Sex (1871), in which he elaborated on the controversial subject only            alluded to in the Origin.\nHe expanded the            scope of evolution to include moral and spiritual as well as physical            traits and underscored man's psychological as well as physiological            similarities to the great apes, predicting, \"the time will before            long come when it will be thought wonderful that naturalists, who were            well acquainted with the comparative structure and development of man            and other animals, should have believed that each was the work of a            separate act of creation.\"\nThe second half            of the book elaborated upon the theory of sexual selection. Darwin observed            that in some species males battle other males for access to certain            females. But in other species, such as peacocks, there is a social system            in which the females select males according to such qualities as strength            or beauty.\nTwentieth-century            biologists have expanded this theory to the selection by females of            males who can contribute toward the survival of their offspring; i.e.,            female selection secures traits that make the next generation more competitive.\nAlthough Darwin's            description of female choice was roundly rejected by most scientists            at the time, he adamantly defended this insight until the end of his            life. While not universally accepted today, the theory of female choice            has many adherents among evolutionary biologists.\nThe last of Darwin's            sequels to the Origin, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals            (1872), was an attempt to erase the last barrier presumed to exist between            human and nonhuman animals--the idea that the expression of such feelings            as suffering, anxiety, grief, despair, joy, love, devotion, hatred,            and anger is unique to human beings.\nDarwin connected            studies of facial muscles and the emission of sounds with the corresponding            emotional states in man and then argued that the same facial movements            and sounds in nonhuman animals express similar emotional states. This            book laid the groundwork for the study of ethology, neurobiology, and            communication theory in psychology.\nLater Works\nThroughout his career            Darwin wrote two kinds of books--those with a broad canvas, such as            the evolution quartet, and those with a narrow focus, such as the treatise            on barnacles. His interests shifted over the years from geology to zoology            to botany.\nIn these later works,            however, he included theoretical interpretation, whereas his earlier            works had contained mostly data. In On the Various Contrivances by Which            British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects (1862) he demonstrated            that plants exhibit complicated characteristics that are adaptive and            that increase the survival of a species.\nOne such characteristic,            for example, is cross-pollination (the mechanism by which pollen is            transferred from one flower to another).\nIn explaining the            interdependence of bees and orchids, Darwin noted that flowers that            are pollinated by the wind have little colour, while those that need            to attract insects have brightly coloured petals and sweet-smelling            nectaries.\nIn The Different            Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species (1877) he observed that            flowers in some species differ in the lengths of their anthers and styles,            which is another adaptation for cross-pollination.\nDarwin experimented            in his garden at Down House in Kent where he raised two large beds of            Linaria vulgaris, one from cross-pollinated and the other from self-pollinated            seeds, both of which he obtained from the same parent plant. He observed, \"To my surprise, the crossed plants when fully grown were plainly            taller and more vigorous than the self-fertilized ones.\"\nHe continued horticultural            experiments for another 12 years on 57 species and described his results            in The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilization in the Vegetable Kingdom            (1876).\nHere he developed            the theme that there are hereditary advantages in having two sexes in            both the plant and animal kingdoms--to ensure cross-fertilization, which,            as he knew from experiments, produced healthier, more vigorous offspring.\nIn On the Movements            and Habits of Climbing Plants(1875) Darwin advanced an adaptive explanation            for the tendency of the stems of certain plants to spiral toward heat            and light, bending either clockwise or counterclockwise.\nThrough experimentation he had discovered that a twining plant would            not twine around an object larger than six inches in diameter. This            characteristic Darwin interpreted as preventing a vine from climbing            up a large tree where the shade from the upper branches would deprive            it of sunlight.\nStill interested            in the mechanism that enables some plants to climb and bend, Darwin            continued experimenting and pinpointed \"some matter in the upper            part which is acted upon by light, and which transmits its effects to            the lower part.\" He reported these researches in The Power of Movement            in Plants (1880).\nA chance observation            of flies caught on the leaf of the common sundew initiated Darwin's            investigation of carnivorous plants. He was especially impressed by            the fact that the living cells of plants possess a similar capacity            for irritability and response as the cells of animals.\nDarwin published            these findings in Insectivorous Plants (1875).\nIn his last botanical            work, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Action of Worms,            which appeared only six months before his death in 1881, he demonstrated            the service that worms perform in digesting leaves and recirculating            organic matter. It was a pioneering study in the field of quantitative            ecology.\nDarwin worked alone            at home, leading the life of an independent scientist (a privileged            existence open to a fortunate few in Victorian England).\nMoney from Robert            Darwin made it unnecessary for Charles to seek employment.\nAfter his return            from the voyage Darwin knew he would never become a clergyman like his            mentor, Henslow. Nor would he remain a bachelor like his brother, Erasmus,            who was a man-about-town.\nAfter drawing up            lists of the benefits and drawbacks of marriage, he proposed to his            first cousin Emma Wedgwood, whom he married on Jan. 29, 1839. She brought            fortune, devotion, and considerable housewifely skills that enabled            him to work in peace for the next 40 years.\nNewly married, the            Darwins moved into a house on Gower Street in London, but within a few            years Darwin's increasingly poor health prompted them to move to the            country.\nIn 1842 the Darwins            moved into Down House in the village of Downe, Kent, only 16 miles from            London but remote from easy access to the city.\nCharles and Emma            Darwin had 10 children: two died in infancy and a third, Anne, died            at age 10. The surviving five sons went away to school. George, Francis,            and Horace became distinguished scientists, and Leonard, a major in            the royal army, was an engineer and eugenicist. William Erasmus was            undistinguished, as were his sisters, who prepared at home to follow            their mother into marriage. Henrietta married; Elizabeth remained single            at Down.\nDarwin was devoted            to his wife and daughters but treated them as children, obliging Emma            to ask him for the only key to the drawers containing all the keys to            cupboards and other locked depositories.\nDarwin noted in            The Descent that the young of both sexes resemble the adult female in            most species and reasoned that males are more evolutionarily advanced            than females.\nHis attitude toward            women colored his scientific insights. \"The female is less eager            than the male,\" he wrote, \"She is coy,\" and when she            takes part in choosing a mate, she chooses \"not the male which            is most attractive to her, but the one which is least distasteful.\"\nHis medical school            experience had left him sympathetic to the popular antivivisectionist            movement, but he admonished women for their involvement in it in a letter            to The Times of London on June 23, 1876:\nWomen, who from            the tenderness of their hearts and from their profound ignorance are            the most vehement opponents of such experiments, will I hope pause when            they learn that a few such experiments performed under the influence            of an anaesthetic, have saved and will save through all future time            thousands of women from a dreadful and lingering death.\nAll expressions of cruelty offended him, and he was an ardent opponent            of slavery.\nComfortable in English            society, Darwin treasured his place and feared alienating those who            he knew would be offended by his theory. He benefited at the beginning            of his career from the scientific fraternity in London, who helped him            understand the specimens from the Beagle, and he appreciated his intellectual            give and take with Henslow, Hooker, Lyell, and Huxley.\nHe was a beneficiary            of this conservative English society, and his fear of ostracism was            one of the forces that prevented him from publishing his theory sooner.            He also dreaded the hurt he knew that his ideas would inflict on his            close friend Henslow and especially on Emma, both devout Christians,            for whom his theory was heresy.\nThe conflict between            his science and his realization of what publication would imply for            the society he was so much a part of manifested itself in physical pain.            The once adventurous young naturalist was a semi-invalid before his            40th year.\nDarwin's illness            has been the subject of extensive speculation. Some of the symptoms--painful            flatulence, vomiting, insomnia, palpitations--appeared in force as soon            as he began his first transmutation notebook, in 1837.\nAlthough he was exposed to insects in South America and could possibly have caught Chagas'            or some other tropical disease, a careful analysis of the attacks in            the context of his activities points to psychogenic origins.\nThroughout the next            decades Darwin's maladies waxed and waned. But during the last decade            of his life, when he concentrated on botanical research and no longer            speculated about evolution, he experienced the best health since his            years at Cambridge.\nDarwin made his            home at Down into his laboratory, where he experimented in his garden            and observed the local fauna. Dogs and cats were part of the Darwin            household, which also was not without a child under school age between            1839 and 1856.\nBy no means a recluse,            Darwin often attended scientific meetings in London; he was away from            home for about 2,000 days between 1842 and 1881. He was a member of            57 leading foreign learned societies and was no less a prominent figure            in the village of Downe, treasurer of the Friendly Club and a Justice            of the Peace.\nDarwin sent his            children to village dances, and, even though he was a skeptical agnostic,            he participated in church functions that were part of village life.\nDarwin died at Down            House on April 19, 1882. Within hours the news reached London, and a            Parliamentary petition won him burial in Westminster Abbey.\nBy this time the            theory of evolution through natural selection was generally accepted.            His ideas were modified by later developments in genetics and molecular            biology, but his work remains central to modern evolutionary theory."

                "A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes is a 1988 popular-science book by British physicist Stephen Hawking.  It became a bestseller and sold more than 10 million copies in 20 years.  It was also on the London Sunday Times bestseller list for more than four years and was translated into 35 languages by 2001. \n\nSummary \n\nStephen Hawking attempts to explain a range of subjects in cosmology, including the Big Bang, black holes and light cones, to the nonspecialist reader. His main goal is to give an overview of the subject, but he also attempts to explain some complex mathematics. In the 1996 edition of the book and subsequent editions, Hawking discusses the possibility of time travel and wormholes and explores the possibility of having a universe without a quantum singularity at the beginning of time.\n\nEarly in 1983, Hawking first approached Simon Mitton, the editor in charge of astronomy books at Cambridge University Press, with his ideas for a popular book on cosmology. Mitton was doubtful about all the equations in the draft manuscript, which he felt would put off the buyers in airport bookshops that Hawking wished to reach. With some difficulty, he persuaded Hawking to drop all but one equation.  The author himself notes in the book's acknowledgements that he was warned that for every equation in the book, the readership would be halved, hence it includes only a single equation: E = mc2.  The book does employ a number of complex models, diagrams, and other illustrations to detail some of the concepts it explores.\n\nEditions \n\n* 1988: The first edition included an introduction by Carl Sagan that tells the following story: Sagan was in London for a scientific conference in 1974, and between sessions he wandered into a different room, where a larger meeting was taking place. \"I realized that I was watching an ancient ceremony: the investiture of new fellows into the Royal Society, one of the most ancient scholarly organizations on the planet. In the front row, a young man in a wheelchair was, very slowly, signing his name in a book that bore on its earliest pages the signature of Isaac Newton... Stephen Hawking was a legend even then.\" In his introduction, Sagan goes on to add that Hawking is the \"worthy successor\" to Newton and Paul Dirac, both former Lucasian Professors of Mathematics. \n\nThe introduction was removed after the first edition, as it was copyrighted by Sagan, rather than by Hawking or the publisher, and the publisher did not have the right to reprint it in perpetuity. Hawking wrote his own introduction for later editions.\n\n* 1996, Illustrated, updated and expanded edition: This hardcover edition contained full-color illustrations and photographs to help further explain the text, as well as the addition of topics that were not included in the original book.\n* 1998, Tenth-anniversary edition: It features the same text as the one published in 1996, but was also released in paperback and has only a few diagrams included. ISBN 0553109537\n* 2005, A Briefer History of Time: a collaboration with Leonard Mlodinow of an abridged version of the original book. It was updated again to address new issues that had arisen due to further scientific development. ISBN 0-553-80436-7\n\nFilm \n\nIn 1991, Errol Morris directed a documentary film about Hawking, but although they share a title, the film is a biographical study of Hawking, and not a filmed version of the book.\n\nOpera \n\nThe New York's Metropolitan Opera has commissioned an opera to premiere in 2015–16 based on Hawking's book. It will be composed by Osvaldo Golijov with a libretto by Alberto Manguel in a production by Robert Lepage."

                "Jack Daniels finally reveals that it was a slave who created the famous whiskey\nJack Daniels finally reveals that it was a slave who created the famous whiskey\nTuesday Jun 28, 2016 · 10:41 AM PDT\n2016/06/28 · 10:41\n170\nDan Call in the shite hat and his slave, Nearis Green\nJack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey is made in Lynchburg, Tennessee. It’s been made there for 150 years now. The mythology surrounding the whiskey brand is that its founder Jack Daniel learned how to distill his whiskey from a minister named Dan Call. It turns out that while Minister Dan Call figures into the history, it is only the fact that he had a slave named Dearis Green. This isn’t a complete revelation, as there have been references to the true history of the whiskey brand before, but with the 150th anniversary at hand, the company is being more open about it (and as this diary proves) and getting a little publicity as well.\nGreen’s crucial role in the Jack Daniel’s whiskey-making process was referenced in the 1967 biography, “Jack Daniel’s Legacy,” by Ben A. Green. In the book, Call reportedly tells his slave (Green) to teach Daniel everything he knows.\n“Uncle Nearest is the best whiskey maker that I know of,” the book quotes Call saying.\nThe art of whiskey making has long been deemed a “lily-white affair,” but the South’s dark history of slavery and whiskey are totally intertwined. Enslaved men made up the bulk of the distilling work force and often had crucial skilled roles in the whiskey-making process, The New York Times reports.\nAn important takeaway from this is that American history is the history of racism, of slavery, of many people working together and a few people trying to take credit for all of that work. It’s not as simple as black and white, but there are a lot of black and white facts that have been swept under the rug. Jack Daniels’ willingness to reveal and talk openly about this previously embarrassing bit of history shows that, even if you believe this is done sheerly for publicity, people believe that our history is not something to shy away from, it’s something to discuss and reveal the truth about. You can still be proud of your history even if you have to admit you were wrong about a good deal of your history. And you can learn where we still need to be by realizing how far we have come.",

                "Jack Daniel's   Distillery   - Whisky.com\nDetails about the Distillery\nThe Whiskey\nJack Daniel’s is very proud to stick to the old traditional recipe that founder Jasper Newton “Jack” Daniel developed. Some say that it was his seventh experiment to generate the perfect mash for the whiskey so the whiskey is still called Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7. Some say it was the number Jack Daniel got from the government for the registration of his distillery, others presume the 7 might have been a tracking number of the railway company on a barrel. We don’t know this for sure but we know that Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 is one of the famous whiskey bottlings of the world. It’s a whiskey with a light and smooth body, a bit oily with sweet aromas from honey and vanilla, with notes of oak and chocolate.\nThe Production\nNot only the recipe but also the production process is done in a traditional way at Jack Daniel’s. There are computers and modern machines, of course, but the way of mashing, distilling, charcoal mellowing and maturing is still the same as it was in the nineteenth century. \nAs mentioned Jack Daniel’s is produced using the original recipe developed by founder Jasper Daniel himself. It’s based on a mash composed of 80% corn, 12 % malted barley and 8% rye. Corn and barley are from the US, the rye from parts of Canada. The grain is stored in big silos; there are eight for the corn, two for the rye and two other ones for the barley.\nThe Still House\nThe Mashing\nOne of the secrets of the smooth taste of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey is the water they use here: It’s taken from a spring on side. On its way the water passes metres and metres of limestone that filters out the contained iron. The result is very smooth water without any bitterness, ideal for the mashing of the corn, barley and rye. No enzymes are added to start the conversion from starch to sugar; just the natural enzymes of the malted barley are at work. Jack Daniel Distillers use the old sour mash process which means a small part of the previous mash is added to the new batch.\nThe Fermentation\nThere are 64 fermenters at Jack Daniel’s with a capacity of 40.000 gallons. That sounds very much indeed - but the production of Jack Daniel’s has to satisfy a steadily growing whiskey market. Jack Daniel’s uses an own yeast strain to ensure the same quality of fermentation and the same aroma over the years.  This yeast is added to the mash to work on the fermentation for a few days until the beer is ready.\nFermenter No. 16 of Jack Daniels\nThe Distillation\nThis beer is now pumped into the column stills that are steamed from the bottom. The stills are made of copper which is very important because copper works as a catalyst for making the spirit smoother. Spirit enters a doubler, as well made of copper, to see a kind of a second distillation. Afterwards it is cooled down through the condensers and ready for the next step. If the spirit was now filled into barrels and matured you would call it Bourbon. To make sure it’s Tennessee Whiskey charcoal mellowing follows.\nThe Still No.1 of Jack Daniel's\nThe Charcoal Mellowing\nThe new spirit, called white whiskey, now is lead into big tanks that are filled with charcoal. This happens drop by drop and the white whiskey runs through the charcoal very slowly. While passing the 10 feet (3.3 metres) of grained and compressed charcoal the spirit is filtered and gets even smoother as it already is before. This charcoal is produced on side by slowly burning down staples of wood, to be exact the wood of hard sugar maple trees.\nCharcoal production at Jack Daniel's\nThe Warehouses\nJack Daniel’s uses multi-storied warehouses. Some are three stories high, some even seven stories. They contain seven thousand to several more thousand barrels. As the temperatures are different at the bottom and the top of the warehouses the whiskey matures slightly different according to where a barrel is stored. This is utilised by Jack Daniel’s and the barrels for the different products are stored at different positions in the warehouses. They maturation usually takes four to six years at Jack Daniel Distillery, depending on the respective product and the individual effect of the barrel.\nThe barrels are all new made of American white oak and toasted before being filled with the white whiskey. Jack Daniel’s has an own cooperage to ensure the quality of the casks.\nInside a Jack Daniel's warehouse\nThe Bottling Lines\nAs Jack Daniel Distillery is a very big producer of whiskey there is not only one bottling line but different ones for the different whiskeys, for example the Jack Daniel’s Single Cask Edition. Bottling, labelling, corking and quality check all happen in line. The common label by the way has not always been black. Jasper Jack Daniel himself started with a green label and only his nephew changed it to black after Jack died.\nBottling lines of Jack Daniel's\nThe History\nJasper Newton Daniel, called Jack Daniel, was born in Lynchburg. We don’t know exactly the date of his birth, some sources say 1846, some talk about 1850, some even precise it and say it was in September.  Jack’s mother died not long after his birth and because of the 10-12 children at home (different statements again) and the re-marriage of his father Jack left home at the age of six (or seven?). He was then raised by Dan Call, a friend of the family and the local Lutheran Minister. Dan not only was a Minister but also a distiller and Jack learnt all about whiskey. When he was about 14 he bought the distillery at Lincoln County from Dan, but shortly after moved to a piece of land at Lynchburg. Here the spring water was a perfect premise for good whiskey. Jack optimized the production process, found his perfect whiskey recipe and registered the distillery, being the first one in the US. \nJack Daniel never married and had no children, so he made his nephew Lem Motlow his heir. Jack died in 1911 (it is said he broke his toe when he kicked a safe and he suffered some years on an infection and blood poisoning until he died). Lem Motlow made an excellent job and when prohibition started at 1910 in Tennessee, he moved to St. Louis and distilled further on. 1920 prohibition spread and the Jack Daniel Distillery closed down. Lem Mortlow went back to Lynchburg and having become a Tennessee state senator his efforts for getting allowance to re-open a distillery at Lynchburg where successful at last. Distillery started in 1938, but he had to promise not to allow the consumption of the whiskey there.\nAfter Lem Motlow died in 1947 his children took over the business until they sold the Jack Daniel Distillery to the Brown-Forman Corporation in 1956.\nAn old check with the signature of Jack Daniel's\nVisitor Center\nEven though Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey has made Lynchburg and its Moore County famous and brings more than 200.000 tourists here each year the consumption of alcohol is still prohibited here. It’s because of a law dating from the time of prohibition that hasn’t been abolished yet. There’s one little exception: Selling of whiskey is allowed at the distillery and its visitor centre.\nThe visitor centre was completed in 1999 and tells the story of Jack Daniel and the distillery.\nTours last about one hour and are offered Monday through Sunday from 9.00 am to 4.30 pm\nThe entrance of the visitor centre\nChronological rating history\nUser Notes about the Distillery\nShare your experience with other whisky lovers.

                "George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 and 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. The eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush, he was born in New Haven, Connecticut. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in oil businesses. He married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. He was elected president in 2000 after a close and controversial election against Al Gore, becoming the fourth president to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than an opponent.  He is the second president to have been the son of a former president, the first having been John Quincy Adams.  He is also the brother of Jeb Bush, a former Governor of Florida and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nEight months into Bush's first term as president, the September 11 terrorist attacks occurred. Bush responded with what became known as the Bush Doctrine: launching a \"War on Terror\", an international military campaign which included the war in Afghanistan, in 2001, and the Iraq War, in 2003. He also promoted policies on the economy, health care, education, social security reform, and amending the Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage.  He signed into law broad tax cuts, the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. His tenure saw national debates on immigration, Social Security, electronic surveillance, and torture.\n\nBush successfully ran for re-election against Democratic Senator John Kerry in 2004, in another relatively close election. After his re-election, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum  Baker, Kevin,  for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina,    and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the \"Great Recession\", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis.  He was met with public protests during visits to the United Kingdom. \n\nBush left office in 2009, returning to Texas where he purchased a home in suburban Dallas. He is currently a public speaker, and has written a memoir, Decision Points.  His presidential library was opened in 2013. His presidency has been ranked among the worst in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s.   \n\nChildhood to mid-life\n\nEarly life and education\n\nGeorge Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, at Grace-New Haven Hospital (now Yale–New Haven Hospital) in New Haven, Connecticut,  as the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce. He was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with four siblings, Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953.  His grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. Senator from Connecticut.  His father, George H.W. Bush, was Ronald Reagan's Vice President from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. President from 1989 to 1993. Bush has English and some German ancestry, along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots. \n\nBush attended public schools in Midland, Texas, until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade. He then went to The Kinkaid School, a prep school in Houston for two years. \n\nBush attended high school at the Phillips Academy, a boarding school (then all-male) in Andover, Massachusetts, where he played baseball, and during his senior year, was the head cheerleader.   He attended Yale University from 1964 to 1968, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History. During this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon, serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year.    Bush became a member of the Skull and Bones society as a senior.  Bush was a rugby union player and was on Yale's 1st XV.  He characterized himself as an average student.  His GPA during his first three years at Yale was 77, and he had a similar average under a nonnumeric rating system in his final year. \n\nBeginning in the fall of 1973, Bush attended the Harvard Business School, where he earned an M.B.A. degree. He is the only U.S. President to have earned an M.B.A. \n\nTexas Air National Guard\n\nIn May 1968, Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard. After two years of active-duty service while training, he was assigned to Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base. Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance. In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.\n\nIn late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard, having moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount.   In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam.  He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974. \n\nMarriage, family, and personal life\n\nAt a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to Laura Lane Welch, a school teacher and librarian. Bush proposed to her after a three-month courtship, and they married on November 5 of that year. The couple settled in Midland, Texas. Bush left his family's Episcopal Church to join his wife's United Methodist Church. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara Pierce Bush and Jenna Welch Bush; they graduated from high school in 2000 and from Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin, respectively, in 2004.\n\nPrior to his marriage, Bush had multiple episodes of alcohol abuse.  In one instance, on September 4, 1976, he was arrested near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for driving under the influence of alcohol. He pleaded guilty, was fined $150, and had his Maine driver's license briefly suspended.\nBush says his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life, and attributes to her influence his 1986 decision to give up alcohol. While Governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, \"I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time.\"\n\nBush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories.  During his time as president, Bush read the Bible daily.  He also read 14 Lincoln biographies and, during the last three years of his presidency, he reportedly read 186 books. Walt Harrington, a journalist, recalls seeing \"books by John Fowles, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and Gore Vidal lying about, as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria\" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other hobbies include cigar smoking and golf.  Since leaving the White House, Bush has also taken up oil painting. \n\nHis first granddaughter, Margaret Laura \"Mila\" Hager, was born to his daughter Jenna Bush on April 14, 2013. She is named after her two grandmothers. \n\nEarly career\n\nIn 1978, Bush ran for the House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. His opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans. Bush lost the election by 6,000 votes (6 percent) of the 103,000 votes cast. He returned to the oil industry and began a series of small, independent oil exploration companies. He created Arbusto Energy,  and later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc.  Bush served on the board of directors for HKN. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading. \n\nBush moved his family to Washington, D.C. in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the U.S. presidency.   He served as a campaign adviser and liaison to the media; he assisted his father by campaigning across the country. Returning to Texas after the successful campaign, he purchased a share in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise in April 1989, where he served as managing general partner for five years. He actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans.  Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $15 million from his initial $800,000 investment. \n\nIn December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 Presidential re-election campaign as \"campaign advisor\".  The previous month, his father asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H. Sununu that he should resign. \n\nGovernor of Texas (1995–2000)\n\nAs Bush's brother, Jeb, sought the governorship of Florida, Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement. Bush's campaign advisers were Karen Hughes, Joe Allbaugh, and Karl Rove. \n\nAfter easily winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent Governor Ann Richards.  In the course of the campaign, Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it after he became governor.  According to The Atlantic Monthly, the race \"featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record – when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowed homosexual activists' to state jobs\".  The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove,  but Rove denied being involved.  Bush won the general election with 53.5 percent against Richards' 45.9 percent.;\n\nBush used a budget surplus to push through Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion. He extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence.  Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.\n\nIn 1999, Bush signed a state law obliging electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources (RPS),[http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess\n76R&BillSB7 SB7] [http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/76R/billtext/html/SB00007I.htm Law text]Texas Legislature Online, May 1999. Retrieved September 24, 2011.   which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S.  \n\nIn 1998, Bush won re-election with a record 69 percent of the vote.  He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms. For most of Texas history, governors served two-year terms; a constitutional amendment extended those terms to four years starting in 1975.  In his second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings. He proclaimed June 10, 2000 to be Jesus Day in Texas, a day on which he \"urge[d] all Texans to answer the call to serve those in need\". \n\nThroughout Bush's first term, national attention focused on him as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared. Within a year, he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nPresidential campaigns\n\n2000 presidential candidacy\n\nPrimary\n\nIn June 1999, while Governor of Texas, Bush announced his candidacy for President of the United States. With no incumbent running, Bush entered a large field of candidates for the Republican Party presidential nomination consisting of John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, John Kasich, and Bob Smith.\n\nBush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.\n\nBush won the Iowa caucuses, but, although he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19 percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum and, according to political observers, effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary, which according to The Boston Globe made history for his campaign's negativity; The New York Times described it as a smear campaign.  \n\nGeneral election\n\nOn July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers by asking Dick Cheney, a former White House Chief of Staff, U.S. Representative, and Secretary of Defense, to be his running mate. Cheney was then serving as head of Bush's Vice-Presidential search committee. Soon after, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the 2000 Republican National Convention.\n\nBush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas. Bush's campaign criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President Al Gore, over gun control and taxation. \n\nWhen the election returns came in on November 7, Bush won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in courts for a month until reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.  On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling,  the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision ordering a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he received 543,895 fewer individual votes than Gore nationwide, Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush was the first person to win an American presidential election with fewer national votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.\n\n2004 presidential candidacy\n\nIn 2004, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, with a political strategy devised by Karl Rove.  Bush and the Republican platform included a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, support for the USA PATRIOT Act,  a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage,  reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts, creation of an ownership society, and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.  Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants, which was criticized by conservatives. \n\nThe Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.\n\nIn the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 electoral votes. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7 percent to his opponent's 48.3 percent).  The previous President to win an absolute majority of the popular vote was Bush's father in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time since Herbert Hoover's election in 1928 that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress.\n\nPresidency (2001–09)\n\nThough Bush originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.  Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq with significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings  steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.  In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession. \n\nDomestic policy\n\nEconomic policy\n\nBush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the Dot-com bubble.  The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. The Bush administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60 percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14 percent, corporate tax revenues by 50 percent, customs and duties by 40 percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107 percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62 percent, Medicare spending by 131 percent, social security by 51 percent, and income security spending by 130 percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35 percent and spending by 65 percent. \n\nThe increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B. Johnson.  The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91,196.\n\nThe surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.Office of Management! and Budget; National Economic Council, September 27, 2000 In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years.  Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35 trillion tax cut program—one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying \"the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money.\" Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs.  Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security.  O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts.  By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant. Another tax cut program was passed that year.\n\nDuring the 2001 to 2008 years, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.125 percent,  less than for past business cycles. \n\nBush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush left office, the average was at 7,949, one of the lowest levels of his presidency. \n\nUnemployment originally rose from 4.2 percent in January 2001 to 6.3 percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5 percent as of July 2007.  Adjusted for inflation, median household income dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007,  while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that \"Median real after-tax household income went up 2%\".  The poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 12.3 percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7 percent in 2004.  By October 2008, due to increases in spending,  the national debt had risen to $11.3 trillion,  an increase of over 100 percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6 trillion.   Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the \"Bush tax cuts\" and increased national security spending.  In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: \"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.\"  By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2 percent. \n\nIn December 2007, the United States entered the longest post–World War II recession, which included a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value.  In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record.   To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170 billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003,  and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.    In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85 billion. \n\nMany economists and world governments determined that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.   Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.  Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market.  Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said \"it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely\", and additionally, that it would have helped \"for Congress to have held hearings\".\n\nIn November 2008, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost.  By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost a total of 2.6 million jobs. \n\nEducation and health\n\nBush undertook a number of educational priorities, such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office, and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation. \n\nOne of the administration's early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.  It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.  Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed \"No Child Left Behind\" into law.  Critics argue that it is underfunded  and that NCLBA's focus on \"high-stakes testing\" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive. \n\nAfter being re-elected, Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that, according to Jan Crawford, resulted in \"the greatest expansion in America's welfare state in forty years;\" the bill's costs approached $7 trillion.  In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six million to ten million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.  Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help. \n\nSocial services and social security\n\nFollowing Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.  The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400 billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly \"better choices and more control over their health care\". \n\nBush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform Social Security, which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress. In his 2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments. Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.\n\nBush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as \"Conversations on Social Security\", in an attempt to gain public support.  Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined  and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.  The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the political fallout from Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005.  After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress as a result of the 2006 midterm elections, there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office.\n\nEnvironmental policies\n\nUpon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the world's population  and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.  He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.\n\nIn May 2001, Bush signed an executive order to create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects,Bush, George W. [http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/Executive_Order_13212.pdf Executive Order 13212 – Actions To Expedite Energy-Related Projects] United States Department of Energy, May 18, 2001. [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid\n61397#axzz1YsGHfHdk Amendment]. Retrieved September 24, 2011. and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues. \n\nIn 2002, Bush announced the Clear Skies Act of 2003,  aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.  The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.\n\nLater in 2006, Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument, creating the largest marine reserve to date. The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument comprises 84 million acres (340,000 km2) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.  The move was hailed by conservationists for \"its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area\". \n\nBush has said that he believes that global warming is real  and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a \"debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused\".  The Bush Administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. Critics have alleged that the administration  misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming. \n\nEnergy policies\n\nIn his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, \"America is addicted to oil\" and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research. \n\nIn his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production.  Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling.  However, the move was largely symbolic as there is still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, \"This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.\" Bush had said in June 2008, \"In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.\" \n\nIn his 2008 State of the Union Address, Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, \"Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive.\" He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, \"This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.\" \n\nStem cell research and first veto\n\nFederal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment by Congress and the signature of President Bill Clinton.  Bush has said that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research.  On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing \"lines\" of stem cells,  but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines.  On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo. \n\nGenetic Nondiscrimination\n\nOn May 21, 2008 President George W. Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).   The bill aims to protect Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment. The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research.\n\nImmigration\n\nNearly 8 million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history.  Almost half entered illegally.  In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12 million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a \"temporary guest-worker program\". Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico–United States border.  From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration.  The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based \"merit\" system for green cards; elimination of \"chain migration\" and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures. Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor.  Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty. \n\nA heated public debate followed, which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions.  The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote.  Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives.  The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law. \n\nOn September 19, 2010, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept 100,000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. \n\nHurricane Katrina\n\nHurricane Katrina, one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history, struck early in Bush's second term. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans. \n\nBush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27,  and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day;  he authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana,  officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.\n\nOn August 30, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it \"an incident of national significance\",  triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan. Three days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans. The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was \"not enough\".\n\nAs the disaster in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what they saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown;  it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the Iraq War  and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods.    Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover. \n\nMidterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys\n\nDuring Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys.  The White House maintained that the U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance.  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department.  The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal. \n\nAlthough Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas.  On July 31, 2008, a United States district court judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas. \n\nIn all, twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress. They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson,  Gonzales' liaison to the White House Monica Goodling,  aide to the president Karl Rove  and his senior aide Sara Taylor. In addition, legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten  were both found in contempt of Congress.\n\nIn 2010, the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings,  the firings were \"inappropriately political\", but not criminal. According to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense. \n\nForeign policy\n\nIn July 2001, Bush visited Pope John Paul II at Castel Gandolfo. \n\nDuring his Presidential campaign, Bush's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in \"nation-building\" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a national missile defense.  Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the World Trade Organization. \n\nIn his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to an axis of evil including Iraq, Iran and North Korea. After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism.  Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.\n\nBush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.\n\nIn March 2006, a visit to India led to renewed ties between the two countries, reversing decades of U.S. policy.  The visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counter-terrorism cooperation, discussions that would lead eventually to the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement. \n\nThis is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure. \n\nMidway through Bush's second term, it was questioned whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia. \n\nIn an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for traveling to Washington to show \"unity of purpose with America\", and said \"America has no truer friend than Great Britain.\" \n\nSeptember 11 attacks\n\nThe September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. On September 14, he visited Ground Zero, meeting with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on a heap of rubble, to much applause: \"I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\" \n\nIn a September 20 speech, Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to \"hand over the terrorists, or ... share in their fate\". \n\nWar on Terrorism\n\nAfter September 11, Bush announced a global War on Terror. The Afghan Taliban regime was not forthcoming with Osama bin Laden, so Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime.  In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an \"axis of evil\" consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq was \"arming to threaten the peace of the world\" and \"pose[d] a grave and growing danger\". The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war.  This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks. \n\nDissent and criticism of Bush's leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued.    In 2006, a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had become the \"cause célèbre for jihadists\".  \n\nAfghanistan invasion\n\nOn October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated, but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders. Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai.   In 2002, based on UNICEF figures, Nicholas Kristof reported that \"our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade\" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid. \n\nEfforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora, which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops.  It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces. Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, remains at large.\n\nDespite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits.  The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned.  In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success.    As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007. \n\nIraq invasion\n\nBeginning with his January 29, 2002 State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an \"axis of evil\" allied with terrorists and posing \"a grave and growing danger\" to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction. \n\nIn the latter half of 2002, CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions.   Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.  \n\nIn late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks.  The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries. \n\nMore than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom), designated the \"coalition of the willing\" joined the United States  in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's \"Mission Accomplished\" speech was later criticized as premature.  From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in Iraq.  Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was \"grave and deteriorating\". While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq,  he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy.  \n\nIn January 2005, free, democratic elections were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years.  According to Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie, \"This is the greatest day in the history of this country.\" Bush praised the event as well, saying that the Iraqis \"have taken rightful control of their country's destiny\". This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as President and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most Shiites and many Kurds. \n\nOn January 10, 2007, Bush announced a surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq, as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2 billion for these programs.  On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops,  saying the debate over the conflict was \"understandable\" but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial. \n\nIn March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government's \"bold decision\" to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army, calling it \"a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq\".  He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the Iraqi elections.  By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began,  and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces.\n\nSurveillance\n\nFollowing the events of September 11, Bush issued an executive order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant as required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.  The program proved to be controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal.  In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional,  but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing.  On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight.  Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.  This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.\n\nInterrogation policies\n\nBush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding as one of several enhanced interrogation techniques.    Between 2002 and 2003 the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on a secret Justice Department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture and Vice President Cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal.   The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn. While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert \"that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information\", the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations \"provided critical information\" to preserve American lives.  Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, \"you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough.\" \n\nOn October 17, 2006, Bush signed into law the Military Commissions Act of 2006,  a law enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, ,  which allows the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees, but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture.\n\nOn March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082,  a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations, saying that \"the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror\".  In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics.  One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department. \n\nNorth Korea condemnation\n\nBush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea, naming North Korea one of three states in an \"axis of evil\", and saying that \"the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\" Within months, \"both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994.\"  North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on \"[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world\". Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to \"a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula\", and stated that \"transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States\", for which North Korea would be held accountable. On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China.  On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007.  By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea. \n\nOn June 22, 2010, \"While South Korea prospers, the people of North Korea have suffered profoundly,\" he said, adding that, \"communism had resulted in dire poverty, mass starvation and brutal suppression.\n\"In recent years,\" he went on to say, \"the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted North Korea's precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs.\" \n\nSyria sanctions\n\nBush expanded economic sanctions on Syria.  In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction  and being supportive of terrorism.  Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to \"undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon\" in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad. \n\nAfrica\n\nBush initiated the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Program (PEPFAR). The U.S. government has spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure that includes $7 billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a multilateral organization),  saving an estimated 5 million lives.  According to The New York Times correspondent Peter Baker, \"Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since.\"\n\nAssassination attempt\n\nOn May 10, 2005, Vladimir Arutyunian, a native Georgian who was born to a family of ethnic Armenians, threw a live hand grenade toward a podium where Bush was speaking at Freedom Square in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was seated nearby. It landed in the crowd about 65 ft from the podium after hitting a girl, but it did not detonate. Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005, confessed, was convicted and was given a life sentence in January 2006. \n\nOther issues\n\nBush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) with Russia. He also signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia.\n\nBush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.\n\nBush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide.  Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.\n\nIn the State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Bush announced $15 billion for this effort  which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women and children worldwide. \n\nOn June 10, 2007, Bush met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania.  Bush has voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo.  Bush opposed South Ossetia's independence.  On August 15, 2008, Bush said of Russia's invasion of the country of Georgia: \"Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century.\" \n\nBush opened the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utha. Departing from previous practice, he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box, saying: \"On behalf of a proud, determined, and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Olympic Winter Games.\"  In 2008, in the course of a good-will trip to Asia, he attended the Summer Olympics in Beijing. \n\nBush twice invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which allows a President to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the Vice President who then becomes Acting President. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, making Vice President Dick Cheney the Acting President. The medical procedure began at 7:09 a.m. EDT and ended at 7:29 a.m. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24 a.m. EDT after the president's doctor, Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the Acting President. Bush invoked Section 3 at 7:16 a.m. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21 a.m. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the Presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers. \n\nJudicial appointments\n\nSupreme Court\n\nFollowing the announcement of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated John Roberts to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.\n\nOn October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel Harriet Miers for O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law,  Miers asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27. Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge Samuel Alito. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006. \n\nOther courts\n\nIn addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district courts. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, is third in American history, behind both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Bush experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies. Debate during one confirmation session lasted \"39 stupefying hours\" according to The New York Times. On August 3, 2001, the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations in status quo, returning 40 judicial nominations, and 164 total nominations.   \n\nAt the outset, Judicature magazine noted that the \"Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings\" before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate. It then cites The New York Times as saying \"Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny.\" \n\nThe Senate confirmed only 8 out of 60 judicial nominations by October 2001. In February 2003, the Democrats successfully filibustered the nomination of Miguel Estrada. \n\nPublic image and perception\n\nDomestic\n\nImage\n\nBush's upbringing in West Texas, his accent, his vacations on his Texas ranch, and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image.  \"I think people look at him and think John Wayne,\" said Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror.  It has been suggested that Bush's accent was an active choice, as a way of distinguishing himself from Northeastern intellectuals and anchoring himself to his Texas roots.  Both supporters and detractors have pointed to his country persona as reasons for their support or criticism.\n\nBush has been parodied by the media,  comedians, and other politicians.   Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public speeches, which are colloquially referred to as Bushisms.  Some pundits labeled Bush \"the worst president ever\".     \nIn contrast to his father, who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme, Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks.  Tony Blair wrote in 2010 that the caricature of Bush as being dumb is \"ludicrous\" and that Bush is \"very smart\".  In an interview with Playboy, New York Times columnist David Brooks said George W. Bush \"was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public. He doesn't want anybody to think he's smarter than they are, so puts on a Texas act.\"\n\nJob approval\n\nBush began his presidency with approval ratings near 50 percent. After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90 percent,  maintaining 80 to 90 percent approval for four months after the attacks. It remained over 50 percent during most of his first term and then fell to as low as 19 percent in his second term. \n\nIn 2000 and again in 2004, Time magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year, a title awarded to someone who the editors believe \"has done the most to influence the events of the year\".  In May 2004, Gallup reported that 89 percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush.  However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and Middle Eastern affairs. \n\nWithin the United States armed forces, according to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections.  While 73 percent of military personnel said that they would vote for Bush, 18 percent preferred his Democratic rival, John Kerry. According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.\n\nBush's approval rating went below the 50 percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004.  Thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. Bush received heavy criticism for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies.  There were calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action.  The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy,  the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq,  and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions.  Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives against Bush on June 9, 2008, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared that impeachment was \"off the table\". \n\nPolls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37 percent approval ratings for Bush,  the lowest for any second-term president at that point of his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28 percent),  which contributed to what Bush called the \"thumping\" of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid-term elections.  Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties;  the average for his entire second term was 37 percent, according to Gallup. \n\nBy the beginning of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19 percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans. Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being \"the worst president,\"   Bush would say, \"I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls.\" \n\nIn the spring of that year, Bush's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of the Gallup poll, with 69 percent of those polled in April 2008 disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28 percent approving—although the majority (66 percent) of Republicans still approved of his job performance.\n\nIn polls conducted in the fall, just before the 2008 election, his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20 percent, while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67 percent to as high as 75 percent.  In polling conducted January 9–11, 2009, his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34 percent, which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and Harry S. Truman, the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s (Richard Nixon's final Gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24 percent). According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted January 11–15, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22 percent, the lowest in American history.\n\nForeign perceptions\n\nBush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization campaigns for his administration's foreign policy.   Views of him within the international community—even in France, a close ally of the United States—were more negative than those of most previous American presidents in history. \n\nBush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of Great Britain and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained.    Other leaders, such as Afghan president Hamid Karzai,  Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni,  Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero,  and Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez,  openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, which led to a cooling of their relationship.\n\nIn 2006, most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security.   In 2007, the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the world. \n\nA March 2007 survey of Arab opinion conducted by Zogby International and the University of Maryland found that Bush was the most disliked leader in the Arab world. \n\nThe Pew Research Center's 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that out of 47 countries, in only nine countries did most respondents express \"a lot of confidence\" or \"some confidence\" in Bush: Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda. \n\nDuring a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim  Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania has a population of 2.8 million,  has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. A huge image of the President was hung in the middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him.   A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana.  The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade. \n\nAcknowledgments and dedications\n\nOn May 7, 2005, during an official state visit to Latvia, Bush was awarded the Order of the Three Stars presented to him by President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga.  A few places outside the United States bear Bush's name. In 2005, the Tbilisi City Council voted to rename a street in honor of the U.S. president.  Previously known as Melaani Drive, the street links the Georgian capital's airport with the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier.  A street in Tirana, formerly known as Rruga Puntorët e Rilendjes, situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007.  In Jerusalem, a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush. \n\nIn 2012, Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves awarded Bush the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana for his work in expanding NATO. \n\nCriticism\n\nThe Bush Presidency has been ranked among the worst in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s.\n\nAfter his re-election in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina,  and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the \"Great Recession\", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nPost-presidency\n\nResidence (since 2009)\n\nFollowing the inauguration of Barack Obama, Bush and his family flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland, Texas, following which they returned to their ranch in Crawford, Texas. They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, where they settled down. \n\nHe makes regular appearances at various events throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area, most notably when he conducted the opening coin toss at the Dallas Cowboys first game in the team's new stadium in Arlington  and an April 2009 visit to a Texas Rangers game, where he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in and was met with a standing ovation.  He also attended every home playoff game for the Texas Rangers 2010 season and, accompanied by his father, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington for Game 4 of the 2010 World Series on October 31, 2010. \n\nOn August 6, 2013, Bush was successfully treated for a coronary artery blockage with a stent. The blockage had been found during an annual medical examination. \n\nIn reaction to the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, Bush stated: \"Laura and I are heartbroken by the heinous acts of violence in our city last night. Murdering the innocent is always evil, never more so than when the lives taken belong to those who protect our families and communities.\" \n\nPublications and appearances\n\nSince leaving office, Bush has kept a relatively low profile  though he has made public appearances, most notably after the release of his memoirs in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2011. In March 2009, he delivered his first post-presidency speech in Calgary, Alberta,   appeared via video on The Colbert Report during which he praised U.S. troops for earning a \"special place in American history,\"  and attended the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy. Bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on October 26 at the \"Get Motivated\" seminar in Dallas.  In the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting that took place on November 5, 2009, in Texas, the Bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and victims' families the day following the shooting, having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage. \n\nBush released his memoirs, Decision Points, on November 9, 2010. During a pre-release appearance promoting the book, Bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping \"the country safe amid a real danger\", and his greatest failure to be his inability to secure the passage of Social Security reform.  He also made news defending his administration's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, saying, \"I'd do it again to save lives.\" \n\nIn 2012, he wrote the foreword of The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs, an economics book published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.    He also presented the book at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas. \n\nBush appeared on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, along with the former First Lady, Laura Bush. When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said, \"I don't think it's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor.\"  Despite this statement, on Saturday, April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President Barack Obama at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: \"You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That's how Americans should view the deal.\" Bush also attacked Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a \"strategic blunder\", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. \n\nAlongside the 2014 United States–Africa Leaders Summit, Bush, Michelle Obama, the State Department, and the George W. Bush Institute hosted a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the African leaders attending the summit. Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment of HIV/AIDS more difficult. \n\nBush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries.  \n\nOn November 2, 2014, Bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum to raise awareness for the upcoming Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C. \n\nBush published a biography of his father, George Bush, called 41: A Portrait of My Father. It was released on November 11, 2014. \n\nIn an interview published by Israel Hayom magazine on June 12, 2015, Bush said that \"boots on the ground\" would be needed in order to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). He added that people had said during his Presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troops in order to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq, and that Al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining President Barack Obama.\n\nBush declined to endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump  and he didn't attend the 2016 Republican National Convention that formally nominated Trump.  On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, \"I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president.\"   \n\nCollaborations\n\nIn January 2010, at President Obama's request, Bush and Bill Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake earlier that month. \n\nOn May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, who was at a restaurant with his wife, to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed.  The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the Ground Zero memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who lost five sons during the Civil War. \n\nVisual art\n\nAfter serving as president, Bush began painting as a hobby. Subjects have included dogs and still life.  He has also painted self-portraits and portraits of world leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair.   \n\nHis paintings have been met with a middling reception from art critics. Bill Arning, director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, called his portraits \"thickly painted in what I would call 'high-amateur' mode\" and wrote, \"I would say they need to be less based on photographic reproduction. You can tell when someone is taking a found photograph and making a painting out of it [...] I think he'd be well advised to work from other, multiple photographic sources or the real person to get a little bit more liveliness going on.\" \n\nLegacy\n\nGeorge W. Bush's legacy remains a contested one. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina and the 2008 financial crisis as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.  \n\nSeveral historians and commentators hold the view that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a \"transformative\" one, and said that \"some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on\".  Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as \"the most noteworthy president since FDR\" and said that the Patriot Act \"increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable\" as evidence.  Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan administration,  and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society.  Much of these policies have endured in the administration of Bush's Democratic successor, Barack Obama.  \n\nAmong the public, his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that \"Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office.\" Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40 percent in January 2009 and 35 percent in March 2009, to 45 percent in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news.  Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement  in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.  In April 2013, Bush's approval rating stood at 47 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for The Washington Post and ABC, his highest approval rating since December 2005. Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53 percent) and the Iraq War (57 percent).  His 47 percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama's in the same polling period. A CNN poll conducted that same month found that 55 percent of Americans said Bush's presidency had been a failure, with 80 percent of Republican calling it a success, but only 43 percent of independents calling it a success and nearly 90 percent of Democrats calling it a failure. \n\nWhile President Bush's approval rating among the public has seen an improvement, the most recent survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and Presidential scholars, conducted in 2010 by the Siena Research Institute, ranked him 39th out of 43 Presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.",
                "A 21-gun salute is the most commonly recognized of the customary gun salutes that are performed by the firing of cannons or artillery as a military honor.\n\nThe custom stems from naval tradition, where a warship would fire its cannons harmlessly out to sea, until all ammunition was spent, to show that it was disarmed, signifying the lack of hostile intent. As naval customs evolved, 21 guns came to be fired for heads of state, or in exceptional circumstances for head of government, with the number decreasing with the rank of the recipient of the honor.\n\nWhile the 21-gun salute is the most commonly recognized, the number of rounds fired in any given salute will vary depending on the conditions. Circumstances affecting these variations include the particular occasion and, in the case of military and state funerals, the branch of service, and rank (or office) of the person to whom honors are being rendered.\n\nHistory\n\nThe tradition of saluting can be traced to the Late Middle Ages practice of placing oneself in an unarmed position and, therefore, in the power of those being honored. This may be noted in the dropping of the point of the sword, presenting arms, discharging cannon and small arms by firing them, lowering sails, manning the yards, removing the headdress or laying on oars.\n\nThe gun salute might have originated in the 17th century with the maritime practice of demanding that a defeated enemy expend its ammunition and render itself helpless until reloaded, a time-consuming operation. The gun salute had been established as a naval tradition by the late sixteenth century. A man-of-war which visited a foreign port would discharge all its guns to show that its guns were empty. Since the ship would not have enough time to reload before it was within range of the shore batteries, it was clearly demonstrating its friendly intentions by going in with empty guns.\n\nSalute by gunfire is an ancient ceremony. For years, the British compelled weaker nations to render the first salute; but in time, international practice compelled \"gun for gun\" on the principle of equality of nations. In the earliest days, seven guns was the recognized British national salute because seven was the standard number of weapons on a vessel. In that day, gunpowder made from sodium nitrate was easier to keep on dry land than at sea. Thus those early regulations stated that although a ship would fire only seven guns, the forts ashore would fire three shots to each one shot afloat, hence the number 21. \n\nThe system of firing an odd number of rounds is said to have been originated by Samuel Pepys, Secretary to the Navy in the Restoration, as a way of economizing on the use of powder, the rule until that time having been that all guns had to be fired. Odd numbers were chosen, as even numbers indicated a death. \nWith the increase in quality of naval gunpowder by the use of potassium nitrate, honours rendered at sea were increased to the shore salute. 21 guns became the highest national honour,\n\nThere was much confusion because of the varying customs of maritime states, but finally the British government proposed to the United States a regulation that provided for \"salutes to be returned gun for gun\". The British at that time officially considered the international salute to sovereign states to be 21 guns, and the United States adopted the 21 guns and \"gun for gun\" return on 18 August 1875.\n\nBy country\n\nBangladesh\n\nThe 21-gun salute in Bangladesh is generally used for:\n* Martyrs (a member of the armed forces or other services or a civilian who is killed in any action or however is honored as a martyr)\n* Opening the Victory Day parade show on 16 December and the Independence Day celebration on 26 March.\n* Occasions that happen to be largely associated with any national achievements or celebrations.\n\nCanada\n\nGun salutes are used at special holidays, state funerals, and for members of the Canadian Royal Family.\n\n21-gun salutes are used for these people and holidays:\n* The sovereign\n* The Governor General of Canada (installation, special events, departure)\n* Foreign heads of state\n* Members of foreign reigning royal families\n* Victoria Day, in honour of The Queen's Birthday, (Monday prior to 25 May, in each provincial capital as well as the national capital)\n* Canada Day, in honour of Confederation, (1 July, in each provincial capital as well as the national capital)\n* Remembrance Day, in honour of war dead (however the proper rate of fire for this \"Funeral Salute\" is one round per minute rather than the normal one round every seven seconds) - the historically correct practice of firing the \"Funeral Salute\" at one minute intervals was revived by The Seymour Artillery Company at Port Moody, BC, in 2007 and has been adopted at other sites since that date, (11 November, in many locations in Canada including provincial capitals, Ottawa, and Montreal)\n*Birth of a member of the royal family\n\nThe prime minister, heads of foreign missions, foreign heads of government, and the Vice President of the United States are entitled to a 19 gun salute.\n\nA 17-gun salute is given to the Canadian Minister of National Defence when visiting a saluting station (limited to once a year), as well as foreign ministers of defence.\n\nA 15-gun salute is given on certain occasions for the lieutenant governors of the provinces, such as the Speech from the Throne in a provincial legislature, or for special occasions such as state funerals of important persons.\n\nRepublic of China (Taiwan)\n\nThe 21-gun salute is used in the Republic of China in honor of the President during National Day celebrations. After three trumpets blow, the audience is asked to stand up as the President enters. After he stands in the podium, the gun salute starts while the gun salute music is played. In some celebrations, it is done while the National Anthem is played.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nThis cannonade salute is used in relation to Czech presidential events and for the inauguration of the Prague Castle guard. It is fired to the sound of the National Anthem. The cannons used today were modified in 1993 from decommissioned 85mm vz.52 artillery cannons with electronic firing mechanisms by the Czech Military Technical Institute of arms and ammunition in Slavičín. The ammunition used is a version of blank shells, modified for an increased acoustic effect. Shots are traditionally fired from either two or four cannons so that, in the case of a failure of one of the weapons, the others will substitute it.\n\nThe salute was given to the ex-president Václav Havel by an artillery battery of four cannons (each firing 21 times) from the Petřín hill on the 23 December 2011 during the commemorative service after his death.\n\nDenmark\n\nGun salutes are used for a variety of occasions, mostly in honor of the Danish Royal Family. There are permanent salutory guns in place at Kronborg Castle in Elsinore, the Sixtus battery at Holmen naval base in Copenhagen, as well as at the naval base at Kangilinnguit in Greenland.\n\nA 27-gun salute is used in honor of Majesties, whereas the 21-gun salute is used in honor of other member of the Danish Royal Family.\n\nGun salutes occur on:\n* 16 April - Birthday of HM the Queen\n* 11 June - Birthday of HRH the Prince Consort\n* At the occasion of royal births\n* At the occasion of royal funerals\n\nGun salutes also occur during naval visits and when a foreign head of state arrives on a state visit. Also, when HM the Queen heads out on her annual summer cruise on the Royal Yacht Dannebrog, she is saluted when passing Kronborg.\n\nThe day after the birth of Princess Benedikte in 1944 which took place during Nazi Germany's Occupation of Denmark, members of the Danish resistance group Holger Danske performed a salute of 21 bombs in the Ørstedsparken public park in central Copenhagen as a reference to the traditional 21-gun salute performed at the occasion of royal births. \n\nFrance\n\nThe 21-gun is accorded to the President of the French Republic, forming part of his \"military honors\" (honneurs militaires). The salute is given during the inauguration ceremony (by two 75mm guns) and during naval visits. These honors are extended to foreign heads of state when in State visit.\n\nAll French Navy vessels anchored in a French harbor on Bastille Day must issue a 21-gun salute at noon, subjected to local regulation.\n\nIndia\n\nThe 21-gun salute is accorded to the President of India on several occasions. As soon as a new President is sworn-in, a 21-gun salute is given. On Republic Day of India, every year, a 21-gun salute is given to the National Flag and the President, during the Flag Hoisting Ceremony. When a foreign head of State visits India, a formal reception is held at the Rashtrapati Bhavan; and the Head of the State is given a Gun Salute.\n\nDuring the British Raj, India developed a formal hierarchical system of gun salutes. Apart from the 101 gun Imperial salute reserved for the British monarch, the more important of the hundreds of vassal rulers of princely states involved in indirect rule were classified by the number of guns used when paying honours to them, signifying their prestige in the eyes of the British. The highest of these so-called \"salute states\" (also in some other parts of the British Empire) enjoyed 21 guns (Hyderabad & Berar, Mysore, Jammu and Kashmir, Baroda, and Gwalior). For years, a few rulers not formally under the control of the British were granted 21 guns (Nepal, Muscat & Oman, Mosquito Coast and Zanzibar) or even 31 guns (Afghanistan and Siam).\n\nSalute for President of India consists of 21 cannon fires.\n\nDuring colonial British rule in India the following head of states had 21 gun salutes based on prosperity rather than military capability:\n#Hyderabad \n#Mysore\n#Jammu & Kashmir\n#Baroda\n#Gwalior\nAnd the following heads of states had 19 gun salutes, (21 locally)\n#Bhopal\n#Kolhapur\n#Indore\n#Travancore\n#Udaipur\nFollowing heads of states had 17 gun salutes,\n#Bundi\n#Bahawalpur\n#Jaipur/Amber\n#Kotah\n#Tonk\n#Bharatpur\n#Cochin\n#Jodhpur/Marwar\n#Orchha\n#Patiala\n#Bikaner\n#Cutch\n#Karauli\n#Rewa\n\nIsrael\n\nIn Israel the practice of gun salute has been eliminated since Israel has suffered many terror attacks  and thus the firing of arms has a negative connotation. The 3-volley salute is still used in military funerals.\n\nPhilippines\n\nIt is used in events, such as the inauguration of the president, death of a top military official, death of a former president or courtesy calls of foreign leaders during their state visits. The practice is heavily influenced by the United States of America.\n\nGun salutes can occur on:\n* 30 June - The Inauguration of the New President\n* Selected day in March - Graduation Parade of the Philippine Military Academy\n* 23 March - Army Day\n* 9 April - Araw ng Kagitingan (Day of Valor)\n* 12 June - Independence Day\n* 21 December - Founding Anniversary of the Armed Forces of the Philippines(Armed Forces Day)\n\nOn these days the 21-gun salute is done by either the Philippine Army or the Philippine Marine Corps.\n\nThe three-volley gun salute can also occur in the death of the low ranking military officials and soldiers who died heroically in combat while the 21-guns are reserved upon news of the deaths of national leaders. The normal 21-gun salute can occur with the state visits of head of states of the foreign countries in Malacañang Palace, with the guns manned by the Presidential Security Group.\n\nPoland\n\nIn Poland the 21-gun salute is used in military funerals and funerals of fallen leaders and heroes. Known as the Salwa Honorowa (Honour Salute), it is also used in national holidays.\n\nPakistan\n\nIn Pakistan a 21-gun salute is used on occasions such as on Pakistan Day (23 March), on which a 21-gun salute is given in provincial capitals and 31 in Islamabad, the federal capital. It is also given on Independence Day (14 August) and Defence Day (6 September). A 31-gun salute in Islamabad and a 21-gun salute in provincial capitals is also given on 12 Rabi-ul-Awwal the birth date of Prophet Muhammad. It is also given when a foreign president or prime minister visits Pakistan. \n\nSingapore\n\nA 21-gun salute is carried out for National Day Parades in Singapore by the Singapore Artillery during the presidential inspection of parade contingents. \n\nThe 21-gun salute was given to the former prime minister and founding leader Lee Kuan Yew during his state funeral. \n\nSweden\n\n21-gun salutes mark special royal occasions throughout Sweden, referred to as a Kunglig Salut (Royal Salute). The number of rounds fired in a salute depends on the place and occasion. The basic salute is 21 rounds. However, when a birth takes place within the Royal House of Sweden, and the child is the firstborn to either the reigning monarch or to the heir to the throne, an extra 21 rounds (for a total of 42) are added to the normal salute. In all other births 21 rounds are fired.\n\nGun salutes occur on:\n* 28 January - Name day of HM the King\n* 30 April - Birthday of HM the King\n* 6 June - National day of Sweden\n* 14 July - Birthday of HRH Crown Princess Victoria\n* 8 August - Name day of HM the Queen\n* 23 December - Birthday of HM the Queen\n\nGun salutes also occur at royal weddings, royal births, royal deaths and when a foreign head of state arrives on a state visit in Stockholm.\n\nMilitary saluting stations are Skeppsholmen and Kastellholmen in Stockholm, Fortress of Kungshall in Karlskrona, Battery of Fårösund on the island of Gotland, Boden Fortress in Boden, Battery of Kusthöjden in Härnösand, Vaxholm Castle in Vaxholm, Skansen Lejonet Fortress and Älvsborg Castle in Gothenburg.\n\n19-gun salutes are used for heads of government, cabinet ministers and ambassadors.\n\nThe Swedish Armed Forces also use a gun salute consisting of two rapid gunshots. This salute, called Svensk Lösen (Swedish signal), was fired whenever a Swedish ship would enter a harbour in order to identify the ship as Swedish, or on the field of battle to identify the Swedish troops. Sometimes a double signal was fired, i.e. four gunshots fired two and two, hence the Swedish tradition of a fourfold cheer instead of a threefold. This signal is today fired on special occasions, usually within the military.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n21-gun salutes mark special royal occasions throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, referred to as a \"Royal Salute\" (in the British Empire it was reserved, mainly among colonial princely states, for the most prestigious category of native rulers of so-called salute states), unless rendered to the president or flag of a republic; nonetheless salutes rendered to all heads of state regardless of title are casually referred to as \"royal\" salutes.\n\nThe number of rounds fired in a salute depends on the place and occasion. The basic salute is 21 rounds. In Hyde Park and Green Park an extra 20 rounds are added because they are Royal Parks. At the Tower of London 62 rounds are fired on royal anniversaries (the basic 21, plus a further 20 because the Tower is a Royal Palace and Fortress, plus another 21 'for the City of London') and 41 on other occasions. The Tower of London probably holds the record for the most rounds fired in a single salute — 124 are fired whenever the Duke of Edinburgh's birthday (62 rounds) coincides with the Saturday designated as the Queen's official birthday (also 62 rounds). \n\nGun salutes occur on:\n* Accession Day (6 February)\n* The Queen's actual birthday (21 April)\n* Coronation Day (the anniversary of The Queen's Coronation, 2 June)\n* The birthday of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (10 June)\n* The Queen's official birthday (the first, second, or third Saturday in June)\n* The birthday of Charles, Prince of Wales (14 November)\n\nGun salutes also occur when Parliament is prorogued by the Queen, on royal births and when a visiting head of state meets the Queen in London, Windsor or Edinburgh. A Royal Salute of 21 Guns is fired at Edinburgh Castle in honour of The Queen or Her Personal Representative, the High Commissioner (female) or Lord High Commissioner (male), when processing in state to the Opening of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland which occurs annually in May. The significance of the 21 Gun Salute is that the Lord High Commissioner is representing the Sovereign as Head of State.\n\nAuthorized military saluting stations are:  \n\nin England:\n*Hyde Park, London\n*The Tower of London \n*Royal Arsenal, Woolwich \n*York Museum Gardens\n*Colchester\n*Royal Artillery Barracks, Larkhill \n*Royal Citadel, Plymouth\n*Dover Castle\n*Fort Blockhouse, Gosport \nin Scotland: \n*Edinburgh Castle \n*Stirling Castle \nin Wales: \n*Cardiff \nin Northern Ireland:\n*Hillsborough Castle \nSalutes are also fired in Gibraltar. \n\nIn London, salutes are fired from Hyde Park and the Tower of London; on State Visits, at the State Opening of Parliament and for Trooping the Colour, Green Park is used instead of Hyde Park. In Hyde Park, the salute is fired by the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery. The first round is fired at noon (11am on The Queen's official birthday). At the Tower of London, the salute is fired by the Honourable Artillery Company at 1pm.\n\nSalutes in Northern Ireland are usually fired from Hillsborough Castle by 206 (Ulster) Battery, although recently they have also been fired from HMS Caroline in Belfast Harbour.\n\n19-gun salutes are used for Field Marshals, ambassadors, and the heads of executive branch of Parliamentary governments (i.e. Prime Ministers).\n\nUnited States\n\nBeginning in the colonial period, the United States fired one shot for each state in the Union as its national salute.\n\nOn 16 November 1776, the West Indian port of St. Eustatius returned a 9-gun salute for the 13-gun salute given by the American brigantine Andrew Doria. At the time, nine guns was the customary salute to an independent republic. This First Salute was specifically ordered by the Dutch governor of the island, and marks the first formal international recognition of the United States as an independent republic. The flag flown by the Andrew Doria was the Grand Union Flag, 13 alternating red and white stripes with the British Flag in the union. The Stars and Stripes received its first salute when John Paul Jones saluted France with 13 guns at Quiberon Bay in 1778 (the Stars and Stripes was not adopted as the national flag until 14 June 1777).\n\nThe practice of firing one gun for each state in the union was not officially authorized until 1810, when the United States Department of War declared the number of rounds fired in the \"National Salute\" to be equivalent to the number of states—which, at the time was 17. The tradition continued until 1841 when it was reduced from 26 to 21.\n\nIn 1842, the United States declared the 21-gun salute as its \"Presidential Salute\". While the \"National Salute\" had been formally established as the 21-gun salute, the current tradition holds the salute on Independence Day to be a 50 rounds—one round for each state in the union. This 'Salute to the Nation' is fired at noon on 4 July, on U.S. military installations, while the U.S. Navy full-dresses ships and fires 21 guns at noon on 4 July, as well as on Presidents' Day.\n\nIn April 1914, during the Mexican Revolution, the Tampico Affair occurred, and escalated as a result of a twenty-one gun salute(or more specifically, the lack of one). Nine unarmed American sailors were arrested in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico, for entering an off-limit area at a fuel loading station. Despite being released, the US Naval commander demanded an apology and a twenty-one gun salute. The apology was provided, but not the salute, giving President Woodrow Wilson reason to order the American occupation of the port of Veracruz.  Due to an arms embargo from the United States, issued to try to lessen the bloodshed of the revolution at its border, Mexico was forced to seek arms from European, and to a lesser extent Asian countries. During the occupation, a large German arms shipment aboard the SS Ypiranga was illegally seized, before being released and turned away by the American occupation force. These events ultimately drove a wedge between Mexican-American and German-American relations, and after the start of World War I on 28 July 1914,  would cause Germany to seek to influence Mexico into declaring war on the United States, in order to halt American arms shipments to the Allies, and attempt to prevent the then isolationist United States from joining the Allies.  This effort ultimately backfired, after culminating in the sending of the Zimmerman Telegram from Germany to Mexico, which urged Mexico to declare war on America, promising support and the return of much of the territory lost during the Mexican-American War, which, after being intercepted, caused America to enter the war on the side of the Allies on 6 April 1917, and due in large part to the arrival of fresh American troops into the war, largely a stalemate in its first years, would lead to the surrender of Germany on 11 November 1918, after helping to overpower the German Army, already fatigued from a long and costly war.\n\nOn Memorial Day, batteries on military installations fire a 21-gun salute to the nation's fallen. As well, batteries at Naval stations and on ships, fire a salute of 21-minute guns and display the ensign at half-mast from 8 a.m. until completion of the salute.\n\nToday, a 21-gun salute is rendered on the arrival and departure of the President of the United States; it is fired in concordance with four ruffles and flourishes, which are immediately followed by \"Hail to the Chief\"—the actual gun salute begins with the first ruffle and flourish, and 'run long' (i.e. the salute concludes after \"Hail to the Chief\" has ended). A 21-gun salute is also rendered to former U.S. Presidents, foreign Heads of State (or members of a reigning royal family), as well as to Presidents-elect. In such a ceremony, the national anthem of the visiting dignitary's country is played, following the salute.\n\nIn accordance with the ceremonial standard operating procedure (SOP) of the 3rd US Infantry (The Old Guard) the various gun salutes are assigned as follows: each round in a given salute is fired one at a time. The number of cannon used in a battery depends upon the intervals between each round fired. This includes, for example, a three-gun battery firing two of its guns with five-second intervals between rounds and one gun remaining at the ready in case of a misfire; such a battery would be used at an Armed Forces Full Honors Funeral, or for State Arrival Ceremony of a foreign dignitary at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. A four-gun battery has its first three guns firing rounds at three-second intervals, with the fourth gun (again) at the ready in case of misfire.\n\nThe SOP also provides each gun salute a two-man gun crew (one loader, one gunner) for each cannon, as well as a five-man \"staff\" of soldiers to give the fire commands. The staff includes an Officer in Charge, a watchman (who marks the intervals and signals each gun to fire), an assistant watchman (as a backup), a counter (who keeps track of the number of rounds fired and signals the last round to the Officer in Charge), and a Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (who marches the battery into place as well as signals the backup cannon to fire in case another gun misfires).\n\nNaval vessels now have saluting guns installed which are used solely for such purpose. The traditional timing chant, \"If I wasn't a gunner, I wouldn't be here. Fire #1,\" etc., has been replaced by stopwatch.\n\nNineteen-gun salutes are reserved for the Vice President of the United States, foreign deputy heads of state, cabinet members, Speaker of the House of Representatives, President pro tempore of the Senate, Chief Justice of the United States, state Governors, foreign heads of government (such as Prime Ministers), chiefs of staff and general officers in the U.S. military of five-star rank. For each flag rank junior to a five-star officer, two guns are subtracted (e.g., for a four-star admiral, a 17-gun salute is prescribed; a three-star general would rate a 15-gun salute; a two-star, 13 guns, and a one-star, 11 guns).\n\nA gun salute is not to be confused with the three-volley salute often rendered at military funerals.\n\nThe gun salutes fired in the United States are as follows: \n\nDeaths of presidents\n\nA U.S. presidential death also involves 21-gun salutes and other military traditions. On the day after the death of the president, a former president or president-elect—unless this day falls on a Sunday or holiday, in which case the honor will be rendered the following day—the commanders of Army installations with the necessary personnel and material traditionally order that one gun be fired every half-hour, beginning at reveille and ending at retreat.\n\nOn the day of burial, a 21-minute gun salute traditionally is fired starting at noon at all military installations with the necessary personnel and material. Guns will be fired at one-minute intervals. Also on the day of burial, those installations will fire a 50-gun salute—one round for each state—at five-second intervals immediately following lowering of the flag.\n\nMedia\n\nSalutt festningen.ogg|Six shots from a 21-gun salute on 4 December 2005 celebrating the birth of the new Norwegian Prince, Sverre Magnus, the previous day\nGun salute for Rama IX's Coronation Day 2009 at Sanam Luang.ogg|A 21-gun salute for 2009 Coronation Day of HM King Rama IX at Sanam Luang, Bangkok, Thailand, 5 May 2009\nRussian anthem at Victory Day Parade 2010.ogg|Instrumental performance of the Russian national anthem at the 2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade in Moscow's Red Square, resplendent with a 21 gun salute\nThe 1st Artillery Battalion fired a 21-gun salute for Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda's royal cremation ceremony.webm|A 21-gun salute in honour of HRH Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda in her royal cremation ceremony, 9 April 2012\n\nCultural references\n\nThe title of the Green Day song \"21 Guns\" is a reference to a 21-gun salute.\n\nIn the song \"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" by AC/DC 21-gun salutes are also mentioned.\n\nIn the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, when the Grandfather sings \"Posh\" whilst dangling from a hot air balloon, there is a line \"they 21 gun salute me\".\n\nBoston-based Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys recorded the song \"21 Guitar Salute\" (originally by The Press) on their 2002 split EP Face to Face vs. Dropkick Murphys.\n\nThe 21-gun salute are also mentioned in the song \"Methods to your Madness\" by heavy metal band Metal Church.\n\nAnother mention is in the Clutch song \"The Mob Goes Wild\".\n\nThe 2000 U.S. Open Golf Championship, held at the famed Pebble Beach Golf Links, saw a unique twist on the 21-gun salute. The tournament's defending champion, Payne Stewart, had died in a plane crash the previous October. Before the tournament began, a ceremony was held in Stewart's memory in which 21 golfers lined up on the 18th fairway and hit drives into the Pacific Ocean."

                "Greek Medicine: THE  GRECO-ROMAN BATH\nTHE  GRECO-ROMAN BATH\nCleanliness  is Health\n     The ancient Greeks and Romans had the wisdom and insight to know that bodily  cleanliness was an essential component of good hygiene and good health.  After the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe was plunged into the ignorance of  the Dark Ages, and this simple and self evident hygienic truth was obscured and  covered over by a plethora of unfounded superstitions about the dangers of  bathing. \n     Bathing is also a way of caring for and loving the body by taking good care of  it.  This ran counter to the Church's prevailing attitude of ascetic  denial and despising of the body and its needs. \n     In Western civilization, bathing practices suffered somewhat of a disruption or  hiatus due to the ignorance and superstition that prevailed in the Dark Ages  and medieval times.  And so, bathing had to reinvent itself in the modern  era.  Consequently, the way we bathe today is quite different from the way  the ancient Greeks and Romans bathed.  Let's see how:\n \nBathing:  A Way of Life\n     The  most important thing to understand about the classical approach to bathing is  that it was a way of life.  The Greek and Roman baths incorporated not  only the mere cleansing of the body, but also exercise and sports, socializing,  lectures and entertainment, and even snacks and delicacies.  Most  importantly, it was a great way to relax and chill out after a hard day's  work. \n     The Romans are most famous for the magnificent baths they built, like the  imperial baths at Caracalla; they were perhaps the most ardent devotees of the  bath.  But the Greeks also loved bathing, although the baths they  constructed were much simpler affairs.  In the ancient Greek baths, we can  see the origins of the later Roman baths. \n     The ancient Greeks and Romans lived a more communal lifestyle than we do today,  and weren't as ashamed to expose their bodies.  Some baths were sexually  segregated, but many others weren't.\n     Toilets at the public baths consisted of a series of slots in a long  slab of marble.  Underneath the marble slab, an inclined sewage ditch with  running water carried away the excrements.  The users of these toilets sat  next to each other, unseparated and unhidden by any partitioning walls or  stalls. \n     A gymnasium or palaestra adjoined many public baths.  This  was used for athletics and sporting activities.  Many athletes worked out  in the nude at sports like running, wrestling and weightlifting; for women, the  preferred activities were swimming and running while driving a rolling hoop  with a stick. \n     Nowadays, bathing is a private matter for most people, as most homes have their  own lavatory and bathing facilities, but in ancient times, bathing was a  communal affair.  In addition to promoting a public spirit of health  awareness, the public baths were centers for socializing and  entertainment. \n     Food vendors hawked their wares of light snacks and delicacies.  Strolling  musicians, acrobats and jugglers offered entertainment.  One could even  listen to the discourses and dialogs of philosophers; even the likes of Plato  obliged the public at the baths. \n \nTypes  of Baths\n     An  ancient Greek steam bath was called a Laconia.  It was usually a  circular room with a large, conical domed roof.  It was heated either by  fires underneath the floor, or by rocks heated in a fire, which were then  brought into the bath with pitchforks and placed into a central tray.  Water was then poured onto the hot rocks to create steam.  Sometimes, the  leaves or branches of Bay Laurel, Fir, Pine, or Juniper were  added for their therapeutic essences.  Or, the infusions or essential oils  of these plants were used. \n     The sweating process could be enhanced by previously massaging the body with  oils medicated with these or other essences, or by quaffing a cup of hot  diaphoretic herb tea like Peppermint or Elder flowers before  entering the steam bath. \n     At the Roman public baths, bathers would usually first soak in the warm waters  of the Tepidarium bath to relax and unwind.  Once the body was  relaxed, and the pores had started to open, the bather then entered into the  pool of the Caldarium, where water temperatures could reach 100 degrees  Fahrenheit, or 40 degrees Celsius or more.  And finally, a quick dip into  the cold water pool of a Frigidarium was needed to brace the body and  close the pores. \n     The warm waters of the Tepidarium relax the muscles and joints, and  improve the circulation, digestion and appetite.  The hot waters of the Caldarium fully open the capillaries and provoke a good sweat.  A final quick  dip in the Frigidarium closes the pores, which protects the  organism from incoming drafts and chills.   \n \nCleaning  the Body\n    Nowadays, soap,  in one form or another, is almost universally used to clean the body, but it  wasn't always so.  The ancient Greeks and Romans first smeared their wet  bodies with a mixture of pumice and ashes, and then applied a liberal dose of  olive oil over that.  Then, they used a curved metal scraper called a strigil to scrape of this \"muck\", which would take the dirt and grime  that had accumulated on the skin along with it.  The body, thus cleaned,  was ready to immerse itself in the large warm or hot water pools for a long  soak. \n     Although soap-like substances have been found in artifacts in archeological  excavations of ancient Egyptian and Babylonian sites dating back to almost  3,000 BCE, according to Roman legend, soap, called sapon,  was invented quite by accident on a sacred mountain, Mount Sapo.  There,  the fat or tallow from sacrificially slaughtered animals accidentally mixed  with ashy water that flowed over the ashes of sacrificial fires to create the  world's first soap.  Or at least that's how we got the word.\n     That's the basic chemistry of soapmaking.  The water and ashes, when mixed  together, create alkaline potassium salts which, when mixed with oils or fats,  transforms them into a detergent, or soap, in a process called saponification.  A detergent, which all soaps are, is a substance capable of emulsifying fats,  grease and grime, so it can be washed away or cleansed by water. \n     In ancient Greece, a soap or detergent was called smegma.  In  modern medical terminology, smegma means a cheesy, foul-smelling exudate that  collects on the genitals of both sexes.  By the second century AD, Galen  was recommending soap for cleansing and therapeutic purposes.\n     An auxiliary cleansing procedure that was sometimes used before the rubdown  with oil or soap was rubbing the wet body with a mitt made of coarse  muslin cloth.  This not only stimulated and opened up the capillary  circulation, but it also removed any residual dead skin on the surface of the  epidermis.\n     Galen also recommended this treatment on the dry, clean body prior to  massage.  It would open the pores, stimulate the peripheral circulation,  and prepare the body to receive the oil.  Nowadays, the traditional coarse  muslin cloth has been replaced, in most cases, by the loofa sponge or the bristle  brush, which are used for the same purposes. \n \nHealing  Spas and Curative Waters\n     The  ancient Greeks were great believers in the therapeutic powers of bathing.  Hippocrates recommends daily bathing and massage with fragrant oils for optimum  health. \n     The ancient Greeks also used medicinal baths of minerals, salts and herbal  infusions for therapeutic purposes.  A bath of clay water or epsom  salts can draw toxins out of the body.  A bath in an infusion of Bay  Laurel leaves or essence stimulates the circulation and relieves rheumatic  aches and pains.  A bath in Lavender scented water soothes the  nerves and helps one relax. \n     The ancient Greeks and Romans went to certain natural hot springs resorts  to \"take the waters\", because these waters had special healing  properties.  Different hot springs resorts were indicated for different  conditions, and each had their own specialties. \n     Wherever the Romans went in expanding their far-flung empire, they took their  baths with them.  The Roman baths at Bath, England are preserved even to  this day.  In Dacia, or present day Romania, Baile Herculane, or  The bath of Hercules, is still functioning, drawing many to seek out its  curative waters. \n     In European countries like Romania, in which many of the old Greek and Roman  spas are still functioning, balneotherapy, or medicinal bathing, is a  recognized subspecialty of medicine.  I will go into hydrotherapy and  balneotherapy in more detail in my article on the Water Cure, in the Therapies section of this website. \n     Bathing, whether for cleansing or therapeutic purposes, makes use of the  Expulsive Virtue of the Water element.  That's the whole principle behind  it, and the secret of its efficacy.\n \nTurkish  Baths, or Hammams\n     The  Roman baths live on in spirit in the Turkish Hammams.  I was priviledged  to have the opportunity to bathe in one the last time I visited Istanbul,  Turkey. \n     First, you are given a towel, some soap, a key, and a cloth skirt, or  wrap.  You enter a private cubicle and undress, wrapping yourself in the  wrap. \n     Then, you enter the main room of the bath.  You are doused with water,  then rubbed with mitts of coarse muslin cloth to rub off the residual dead  skin. \n     Next follows a thorough sudsing and rubdown with soap, worked into a profuse  lather.  Then, you are dowsed again and rinsed of the suds.  A second  sudsing and lathering follows, followed by a second rinse. \n     Then, you soak in a hot tub, or lie on a warm marble slab to relax and  chill out.  If you wish, you may receive a massage with fragrant, scented  medicinal oils. \n     When you come out, you feel thoroughly refreshed, revitalized and thoroughly  clean.  You have been reborn!\n \nInternet  Resources\n     There  are many great internet sites on Greco-Roman bathing practices, many of which  provided a lot of the information in this article. \n     The PBS TV program Nova has an excellent site up on the Roman baths.  The  highlight is a virtual tour of the imperial Roman baths at Caracalla, and even  recipes for some of the traditional Roman snacks and delicacies that were  available at the baths.  The site is at:",
                "Roman Baths and Hygiene in Ancient Rome\nRoman Baths and Hygiene in Ancient Rome\nRoman Baths and Hygiene in Ancient Rome\nToilets, etc.\nBy N.S. Gill\nUpdated August 09, 2016.\nHygiene in ancient Rome included the famous public Roman baths, toilets, exfoliating cleansers, public facilities, and -- communal toilet sponge (ancient Roman Charmin®) notwithstanding -- generally high standards of cleanliness.\nWhen trying to explain to children, students, readers, or friends what life was once like, nothing gets to the heart of the matter more poignantly than intimate details about daily life. Telling young children that there were no televisions, movies, or radio, no electric or traffic lights , no refrigerators, or air conditioners , no cars, trains, or airplanes, doesn't convey the \"primitive\" conditions nearly so well as explaining that instead of using toilet paper, they used a communal sponge -- dutifully rinsed out after use.\nIn reading about the ancient practices, it is important to put away preconceived notions. Did urban centers like ancient Rome stink? Certainly, but so do modern cities, and who's to say whether the smell of diesel exhaust is any less overwhelming than the smell of Roman urns for collecting urine for the fullers (dry cleaners)?\ncontinue reading below our video\n10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don't Know\nSoap is not the be-all and end-all of cleanliness. Bidets are not so common in the modern world that we can afford to scoff at ancient hygiene practices.\nThreads on ancient hygiene generated enormous interest in the Ancient/Classical History Forum. The following are some of the points made by those interested and knowledgeable about ancient Rome.\nAccess to Toilets\n\"According to O.F. Robinson, Ancient Rome : City Planning and Administration, there were 144 public latrines in Rome in the later Empire. Apparently mostly concomitant of the public baths, which only makes sense as they could share water and sewerage. There may have been a token payment if they were separate from the baths, she conjectures. She also writes that they were comfortable places, where one might sit and read, or otherwise \"amuse oneself sociably,\" hoping for [dinner] invitations. She cites a ditty by Martial :\nWhy does Vacerra spend his hours\nin all the privies, and day-long sit?\nHe wants a supper, not a s**t.\"\n[Urine tax] \"Public urinals consisted of buckets, dolia curta. The contents were regularly collected and sold to the fullers for cleaning wool, etc. That's where the tax story comes in. The fullers were the ones who were taxed. The collectors had public contracts and could be fined if late.\" ROMAHOST\nAccess to Hygiene Facilities for the Rich\n\"Readings from The Visible Past, by Michael Grant, indicate that hygiene in the Roman World was limited to the rich and famous, except for those who could afford the public baths or thermaes, as running water did not reach the poor's tenements from the aqueducts; these lesser folks relieved themselves in pots or commodes which were emptied into vats located under staircases and these emptied into cesspools throughout the city. The rich and famous, from the emperor on down, enjoyed running water in palaces and mansions from lead pipes connected to the aqueducts. At Pompeii, for instance, all houses except the poorest had water pipes fitted with taps, and the waste water was piped away into sewer or trench.\" ANDRESGRANA\nAccess to Hygiene Facilities for the Poor\n\"Florence Dupont (Daily Life in Ancient Rome) writes that it was for reasons of ritual that the Romans washed frequently. And she adds that \". . . even in very ancient times and even in the depth of the country, Romans, including women and slaves, would wash every day and would have a thorough bath on every feast day if not more often. At Rome itself, baths were taken daily.\n\"According to her, the admission fee at public baths was one-quarter as. [Affordable for pretty much everyone.]\n\"Joachim Marquardt (Privatleben der Römer) writes that fees differed, mentions one-quarter to one as for men, but always one full as for women, and that children got in free. He also writes that life-long free baths might be bequeathed in wills. That in itself seems to stress the importance of bathing.\" ROMAHOST\nRoman Way of Cleaning Clothes\n\"I have read that the Romans learned of soap from the Germans some time in the first century CE, and that previous to that they used urine (ammonia) for clothes. Using the two in combination, of course, would be even more effective. Urine was apparently treated in some way before use, but I do not know how. It may have been either a chemical process or a distillation.\" RMARTINEK\nHair Care in Ancient Rome\n\" Ovid' s advice on grooming includes hair removal, and not just men's beards. Whether this was accomplished by shaving, plucking or other depilatory practices is sometimes hard to tell. Julius Caesar was noted by Suetonius to have been meticulous in hair removal. Seems he didn't want hair anywhere except where he didn't have it (the crown of his head, hence the famous comb-over).\n\"Not that hair is inherently dirty or stinks; but there was an aesthetic of cleanness, of refining the surface. I've read somewhere that pervasive hair removal was characteristic of Egyptian priests, maybe as a form of purification; for practical purposes, it reduces susceptibility to lice, for instance.\" CYNWOLFE\nTools For Cleaning\n\"As Romahost has already said, [a strigil] is an instrument for scraping the skin. Bear in mind that oil was used in classical times for removing grime, and unlike soap which forms a lather with water and can be rinsed off, the oil had to be scraped off; thereafter, in a water-rich area (eg Italy) a bath could be taken, and in other cases clean (scented) oils could be used to finish off the job.\n\"The strigil at first glance looks a bit like a clasp-knife, handle and blade being in total about 8\" (if memory serves) in most cases. The blade is gently curved to accommodate the curves of the body and the handle is sometimes of another material such as bone or ivory.\n\"I have read somewhere that Augustus' face had sores caused by excessive use of the strigil.\n\"The museum at Thessalonica in N. Greece has plenty of them; They must have a website, so I am sure you will be able to get all the info you need. THEAGENE1\nCleansers vs. Soap in the Ancient World\n\"A respondent later in this exchange reminded readers of the Roman use of olive oil, along with the strigil to exfoliate. Soap is mainly just processed fat. The Celts of Gaul are sometimes credited, I think by Pliny, with the invention of soap (sapo) and may have used sheep tallow to make it. I'm not sure rubbing one's body with a product made from the fat of slaughtered animals is inherently more aesthetic or clean than using olive oil.\n\"It occurs to me that sitting on the edge of my own bathtub is a commercially prepared exfoliating rub made from olive oil, coarse salt, and sage extract, which would have been quite at home in another of Ovid's treatises, the one on making cosmetics. And at my local holistic grocery store or international market, I can buy a gentle, emollient soap made from olive oil, to confuse the distinction between oil and soap further. CYNWOLFE\nMore on Soap\n\"Further to the writer's discussion about soap, (and urine as a cleanser, etc.), and having just seen a programme about the Colosseum where a comment was made about death being a constant companion, tombs by the entrance to the city and the smell of burning corpses... (How the heck did they put up with the stench?) how much of a sense of hygiene did the Romans have? I know they didn't have the modern understanding of germs etc. Did their obsession with bathing extend to their clothes and homes? Did they have social/religious rules or customs (like the Jewish religious guidelines) that, by default, resulted in reduced spread of disease? Did their strict military camp setup result in improved hygiene?\" AB_DRAWSKTCH\n \nHistory of Shaving\n\"Here is an interesting webpage about the history of shaving. I am not too sure about all of the information. The author seems to think that because high foreheads were fasionable for women during the first half of the fifteenth century, that high foreheads were fashionable from 476 - 1270 A.D.\" KIRKALAN",
                "The History of Soap Making - Super Soap Making\nSee All Articles\nThe History of Soap Making\nThe history of soap making is closely  woven into the history of many civilizations. This is because soap  (once discovered) was not only used for cleaning, but it was also  used for healing, for religious rituals, and to show wealth or  prestige.\nThe Ancient World\nOur first records of soap were dated as  early as 2800 BC. An excavation of ancient Babylon revealed evidence  of soap making since soap-like material (remains of fats boiled with  ashes) were found in clay jars. It is unknown, however, if these were  used for the same purposes we use soap today. This soap-like material  could have been used as a hairstyling aid, just as the Germans and  Gauls of ancient Europe used soap (a mixture of tallow and ash) to  tint their hair.\nNext oldest are records found in  ancient Egypt, particularly the Ebers Papyrus which was dated 15000  BC described the combining of animal and vegetable oils with alkaline  salts. The material that was formed (soap) was said to treat skin  diseases, and was also used for washing. It seems that though the  ancient Egyptians did have soap and their records show that they  bathed regularly, they used other materials for their personal  hygiene.\nThe Bible too has records of soap  making, with Moses giving an order to mix oils and ashes in order to  produce a cleanser for the hair. It was from Moses' decree that the  famous line “cleanliness is next to godliness” was derived.\nThough this history of soap making  shows that many ancient civilizations had access to soap and had  knowledge of cleanliness, they didn't exactly see soap as part of  cleanliness. For example, the ancient Greeks would bathe often and  wash their clothes often, but neither process involved soap.\nThe Romans\nAn old Roman legends speaks of the  discovery of soap as accidental. When the rains washed away a mixture  of animal fat and wood ashes from Mount Sapo, the mountain in which  animals were sacrificed for religious rituals, this mixture mixed in  with the clay along the Tiber. This is why the women of Rome always  found it easier to wash their laundry along the waters of the Tiber.\nLike the Greeks, the Romans were well  aware of cleanliness. One of the things the empire is famous for are  the Roman Baths. These public bathing places were quite popular among  the Romans, who constantly tried to improve their bathing systems and  their cleanliness rituals. By the 2nd century AD, the  Roman Galen recommended that soap must be used for bathing.\nSo soap gained acceptance among people  and was sometimes seen as a necessity. After the fall of the Roman  Empire, however, the Middle Ages brought about a dark and  superstitious time which gave no importance to bathing. It is said  that the lack of hygiene during this period is one of the reasons for  the many plagues that wiped out the populations in Europe. The lack  of hygiene continued for a long period of history, and it wasn't  until the 17th century did bathing become popular once  more.\nEarly Modern Period\nThe history of soap making took a great  leap during this period in time. Soap making became an established  craft among the guilds in Europe. Their most basic recipe was to mix  vegetable and animal oils together with the ashes of plants. They  also added fragrance to the mixture. With the development of many  fragrances and the experimentation of which oils to use, guilds began  to develop varieties of soap, turning the simple procedure into a  profitable industry.\nIn the beginning, the soap was greatly  taxed, making it something only the rich could afford. Later on,  however, the tax was removed and soap became available to all people.  This boosted its popularity, and soon everyone was bathing with soap!\nEarly centers of soap making in Europe  include Italy, Spain, and France because these countries had a steady  and good supply of raw materials for making good quality soap. Olive  oil, for example.\nColonial History and the Modern World\nEurope's history of soap making is  centered around discovery. The history of soap making among the  colonies is centered around the manufacturing of soap. It was during  this era that discoveries or experiments yielded fruitful in the  development and production of cheaper materials for making soap in  abundance.\nSoap manufacturers in the colonies  adapted the new developments and discoveries involved with the making  of soap. It was this openness to new methods and the support for  “building things bigger” that  prompted William Colgate to open  Colgate & Co. in 1806. His company became the first big soap  company in America, being able to produce 45000 lbs. of soap in one  batch.\nNot long after, William Proctor and  James Gamble opened their own company from which Ivory soap was  produced. B.J. Johnson also created his own company which chose to  make soap only with palm and olive oils. He named his soap Palmolive,  after the oil combination.\nThe soap industry continued to grow.  However, most of the companies still used the old methods of making  soap, which involved natural materials. It wasn't until a fats and  oil shortage in Germany during World War I did scientists work on the chemistry of soap making and begin to  develop synthetic materials for making soap. These synthetic  materials produced a soap that did not combine with mineral salts in  water (which natural soaps did) and form insoluble soap curds. They  also found that these synthetic soaps made excellent cleaning agents,  now known as detergents.\nAmerican soap manufacturers embraced  the methods for making detergents, but continued to make natural  soaps for self-hygiene. It wasn't until World War II when another  shortage of fats and oils came did the detergent industry really take  off in America. Primarily because the military needed a good and  cheap cleaning agent that would work well with the sea water they had  to wash their clothes with.\nAfter the war, soaps and detergents  continued to improve. The first commercially manufactured liquid hand  soap came out it 1970, and from this innovation others followed. Now,  there are so many types of soaps! From liquid soap to bath bombs to  soap gels or beads, herbal soaps, natural material soaps, decorative  soaps, and so many more!",
                "History of Olive Oil\nHistory of Olive Oil\nCrete Products\nHistory of Olive Oil\nOlive tree cultivation and olive oil production has been with humankind since time immemorial, according to evidence that provide the artefacts and archaeological remains of the most ancient  civilisations. The olive has been an  integral part of life in the eastern Mediterranean  from the first stirrings of civilisation. There are stone mortars and presses  used for olive oil extraction that date back to 5000 BC ( History of olive oil in Israel ). Archaeological findings from the Minoan Palaces in Crete  are fine examples of olive oil’s role in the Cretan or Minoan civilisation,  which reached its zenith between 2000 and 1450 BC.\nFrom the time of ancient Egypt into the modern religions,  olive oil has been used in religious ceremonies and as an external ointment,  and you will find many citations about the olive in the Old Testament and other  holy writings. After the Flood, an olive leaf brought by a dove told Noah that  the flood waters had abated. Clay tablets from the reign of Nebuchadnezzar  listed allocations of oil to Jeboiachin, the young king of Judah, taken  prisoner by the Babylonians in 597 BC.\nThroughout the various civilisations, the olive tree and olive oil  have occupied pivotal positions in the agricultural economy of Mediterranean  countries and in their commerce with neighbouring populations. The Minoans of  Crete were among the first cultures to achieve prosperity on olive oil, and   Crete continues to be an important  olive production area to the present day.\nHistory of Olive Oil: Olive Oil in Minoan Crete\nFresco at the Knossos Palace - Bull and Olive Tree\n \nArchaeological finds proving that the Minoans  used olive oil in their daily lives are found everywhere in Crete.  One particularly impressive discovery is the untouched olives with the flesh  preserved, found at the bottom of a cup sunk in a water cistern at the Minoan  Palace of Kato Zakros. The Minoans used olive oil in their diet, as a cleanser  instead of soap , as the base for scents and ointments, as a medicine, in  tanning, for lighting and to protect delicate surfaces.\nAncient stone olive presses have been found in Crete. The one in Vathypetro, Archanes is believed to be  the oldest in Europe. Olive oil was stored in  large pithoi like those found in the West Magazines of the Minoan Palace of Knossos , with a total estimated capacity of  250,000 kilos.\nTraditional scholarship puts the origin of olive trees in ancient Iran and Turkestan.  However, other scholars argue that the modern olive tree must have originated  in multiple locations, since it seems to have appeared simultaneously in  southern Anatolia (now Turkey), Palestine (now Jordan and Israel), and the  Levant (now Syria and Lebanon) — countries that, as the ox cart went, were so  far from each other in antiquity.\nOlive tree cultivation was already widely scattered in the eastern Mediterranean, Egypt,  and North Africa by the time the proto-Greeks  colonised the Greek peninsula. Cultivation was not a universal activity, and as late as  500 BCE, civil leaders were  still exhorting people to grow more olive trees.\nHistory of Olive Oil: Olive Oil in Ancient Greece\nThe olive tree was a particularly important  symbol for the ancient Greeks. It was connected to their diet and their  religion, and was used as a decorative motif on vases, in gold jewellery and  elsewhere. It was considered a symbol of peace, wisdom and victory. That is why  the winners of the Olympic Games were crowned with a wreath of wild olive (the  cotinus).\nOlives in antiquity were usually gathered by  beating the tree with rods, although ancient authors condemned this practice.  Pliny repeatedly recommends: “Do not shake and beat your trees. Gathering by  hand each year ensures a good harvest.”\nThe olive-harvesting knowledge of the ancients,  incredibly advanced for its time, was often aided by astronomy, used to predict  poor harvests. Thales of Miletus, for example, used his astronomical  observations to predict an excellent harvest for 596 BC. He immediately  established many new oil-presses on Chios and Melos,  making the islands’ inhabitants rich in a year. Democritus also studied the  relationship between good harvests and the positions of the stars.\nOlive oil had many uses in ancient Greece,  differing according to social status. Poor people, for instance, did not  consume olive oil but ate many cereals. The rich, on the other hand, were able  to use olive oil in cooking, for cleaning their bodies and for lighting.\nOlive oil was also a valuable medicine in the  hands of ancient Greek doctors. Hippocrates mentions 60 different conditions  which could be treated with it, such as skin conditions, wounds and burns, gynaecological  ailments, ear infections and many others.\nGreek Athlete removing the olive oil\nfrom his body with a stlengis ( strigil )\nWhen medicine was not enough to save the  patient, olive oil was used in laying out the dead. Women washed the body and  anointed it with olive oil or scented oils. Oil, wine, honey and other products  were offered to the dead at the graveside.\nAnother popular use of olive oil in ancient Greece was for  oiling athletes’ bodies before exercise in the gymnasium and at games.\nOlive  oil was also a valuable winner’s prize. The city of Athens needed about 70,000 kilos of oil to  reward the winners of the Panathenian Games, held every four years.\nThe winner’s prize varied according to the  event. The best runner received about 70 amphoras of 35-40 kilos, i.e. 2,500  kilos of olive oil, while the chariot-race winner got double, i.e. about 5,000  kilos. These prizes were worth a lot of money if you consider that a day’s  wages for an Athenian craftsman was 1 Attic drachma, the equivalent of about 3  kilos of olive oil. And that was just the price of common oil, whereas the  winner’s oil was much better quality and more expensive. Of course no-one would  buy this oil to eat; instead it was used for anointing the bodies of rich young  athletes.\nHistory of Olive Oil: Olive Oil in the Greek colonies\nIt was the ancient Greeks who introduced the cultivation of the  olive to their colonies. The Greek population was growing fast, and after a  while, there was no longer enough room for everyone in the cities. The more  adventurous among them began moving out and founding Greek colonies in Sicily, southern France,  and the west coast of Spain  as early as 800 BCE. Other émigrés went  east, reaching the shores of the Black Sea.  Everywhere they went, they took olive trees with them. In 600 BCE, the Phoenicians were active in the western Mediterranean, and  were consolidating their trade routes, buying olive oil from Philistia and the  city of Ekron in what is now Israel.\nDealing in olive oil was the backbone of the import-export trade in  the ancient world. Merchants came from Phoenicia,  Crete and Egypt  to the Mediterranean basin and even farther, from 600 BCE onwards. The Scythians of the southern steppes of Russia  came to replenish stocks of olive oil at the prosperous Greek trading posts of  the Black Sea which later became the spas of Romania. Depositories of oil jars  such as those of Komos in Crete are evidence of  the importance of the olive oil trade. Olive oil was already liquid gold, ages  before fuel oil became known as black gold.\nThe Romans copied many of the Greek practices as they developed  their empire and expanded the olive cultivation the Greeks had started. At  first they did not cultivate olive trees in Italy  itself but relied on established producers in distant provinces like those in Spain, thus increasing their olive oil trade  with the conquered countries of the Roman Empire.  After conquering the whole of the Mediterranean and eliminating the last  vestiges of Greek power, the Romans began cultivating the olive tree in Italy.\nWith the fall of the Roman Empire  in the fifth century CE and the Barbarian invasion, olive cultivation declined for a  millennium. Western Europe entered the Dark Ages, but olive production  persisted in the Eastern Roman empire, Byzantium.  With recurring invasions by various Christian armies and later the Ottoman  conquests, Byzantium was hardly a stable place  during these years, but olive cultivation remained an important activity in the  land that is now Turkey.\nOlive oil regained its ancient role only in the Middle Ages, mainly  under the careful influence of religious communities. However, it took much  longer before olive oil again became the liquid gold of antiquity.\nAfter the 16th century AD, Europeans  introduced the olive tree to the New World and it is now cultivated in California, Mexico,  Peru, Chile and Argentina. It is estimated that  there are about 800 million olive trees in the world today, the vast majority  (95%) in Mediterranean countries. Olive trees are widely cultivated in Greece,  far more so than any other fruit tree, comprising 75% of total arboriculture  and covering about 15% of agricultural land.\nOlive Oil in Languages\nThe influence and movement of the olive tree and olive oil was very  extensive. The words used for olives and olive oil in modern languages still  give a hint of these ancient movements. Where the trees were brought by the  Greeks, the olive tree was called by the Greek term elaia, today elia, and olive oil was called elaioladho. The Latin word olea is a corruption of elaia. Olea in turn migrated into the  Romantic languages, so that even the English word oil reflects that linguistic  descent.\nWhere the olive followed the Phoenician trading routes, words that  stem from the Semitic word for olive, zeit,  are common: sait, taiti, even tat in Egypt. Further west in Morocco, the  olive oil was known by one of these Semitic variants. The Phoenicians were said  to be the first to plant olive trees on the Iberian   Peninsula. The Romans greatly expanded the orchards, but the Moors  thoroughly expunged almost all traces of Rome in  their 7th century conquest of Iberia  and centuries-long occupation of Spain. Today, traces of Arabic  remain in modern Spanish: olive oil is aceite.",
                "A History of Baths and Showers\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF BATHS AND SHOWERS\nBy Tim Lambert\nBaths and Showers in the Ancient World\nThe Egyptians are known for their cleanliness (they bathed frequently) and they used many cosmetics. Meanwhile in Babylon before 2,000 BC a form of soap was made. The Greeks knew that diet and exercise and keeping clean were important for health. The Greeks even invented a form of shower, which sprayed bathers with water.\nMost Greeks washed in a bowl on a pedestal called a louterion though the rich sometimes had bathrooms. People rubbed themselves with olive oil then rubbed it off with a tool called a strigil.\nThe Romans also knew that dirt encourages disease and they appreciated the importance of cleanliness. They built aqueducts to bring clean water into towns. In Roman towns an important building was the public baths. In Roman times people went to the baths not just to get clean but also to socialize. Roman Baths consisted of a frigidarium or cold room, a Tepidarium or warm room and a caldarium or hot room. You usually finished with a dip in a cold pool. To clean themselves Romans rubbed their skin with oil and scraped it off with a tool called a strigil. (The Romans also made soap).\nRoman women also used razors, pumice stone, tweezers and depilatory creams to remove unwanted body hair.\nBaths in the Middle Ages\nIn the Middle Ages there were bathhouses in many towns were people could pay to have a bath. Furthermore in Northern Europe in the Middle Ages people took sweat baths.\nIn the 14th century Edward III installed a bathroom in the Palace of Westminster. Other people made do with wooden tubs in their bedrooms.\nFurthermore in the Middle Ages there was an important soap making industry in England (although many people made their own soap at home). In the Middle Ages people used combs and tweezers. They also used toothpicks and mouthwashes.\nIn the Middle Ages in monasteries streams provided clean water. Dirty water was used to clear toilets, which were in a separate room. Monks also had a room called a laver where they washed their hands before meals.\nBaths and Showers 1500-1800\nMost Tudors cared about their appearance. People carried mirrors made of glass or steel. They also carried combs and used tweezers, ear scoops and bone manicure sets. In the Summer people sometimes had a bath in the local river. Sometimes they heated a cauldron of water and had a strip wash. Or they could have a 'dry wash' by rubbing themselves with clean linen.\nIn the 16th century bathrooms were very rare but Henry VIII had a bathroom in Hampton Court Palace. It had a simple boiler for hot water.\nIn the 17th century people used toothpicks but in the latter part of the century toothbrushes were introduced. (Toothbrushes came from China. They were first mentioned in 1498). People also made scented soaps. Then in 1767 Englishman William Feetham invented the first modern shower. However in Britain showers did not become common until the late 20th century.\nBaths and Showers in the 19th Century and 20th Century\nIn the mid 19th century middle class homes began to have bathrooms. Having a bath was also made much easier by the development of gas water heaters. The electric water heater was invented in 1889. Working class houses with bathrooms were first built around 1900 and in the 1920s council houses were built with bathrooms. However at that time bathrooms were still a luxury. As late as the early 1960s many homes in Britain did not have a bathroom.\nFrom about 1800 portable metal bathtubs gradually replaced wooden ones and in the 19th century some people used hand-pumped showers.\nIn the 19th century toothpaste was sold in jars until 1892 when Washington Sheffield invented the collapsible toothpaste tube. Meanwhile in 1888 the first modern deodorant was invented. It was called Mum.\nThe first safety razors for men were sold in 1901. Women first began to shave under their arms in the 1910s. The first razor for women was introduced in 1915.\nIn the 19th century most homes also had a scullery. In it was a 'copper', a metal container for heating water for washing clothes. The copper was filled with water and soap powder was added. To wash the clothes they were turned with a wooden tool called a dolly. Or you used a metal plunger with holes in it to push clothes up and down. Wet clothes were wrung through a device called a wringer or mangle to dry them. The clothes wringer or mangle was invented by Robert Tasker in 1850.\nSimple hand operated washing machines were invented in the 18th century. The first electric washing machine was made in 1907. In Britain washing machines first became common in the late 1950s and 1960s. Meanwhile The electric clothes dryer was invented in 1935 by a man named J. Ross Moore. The first laundromat opened in Fort Worth, Texas in 1934. The first laundrette in Britain opened in 1949.\nJosephine Cochrane invented the first practical dishwasher in 1886. By 2009 36% of households in Britain had a dishwasher. Steel wool cleaning pads were invented in 1913.\nMeanwhile soap was rationed in Britain from 1942 to 1950.\nPeople used to wash their clothes with soap flakes. The first synthetic detergent was invented in Germany during the First World War. In the following decades detergents were gradually improved and became more common. Today washing is much easier than it was in the past. Washing is a lot easier with the proper water heater.",
                "History and making of homemade soap with used olive oil.\n \nHISTORY AND MAKING OF HOMEMADE SOAP WITH USED OLIVE OIL\nSoap is an ancient product, as old as man's need to    clean himself. Soaps do not only have hygenic benefits but they were    also conceived as ointments dedicated to alleviating aches and pains or    to relax the body. Its true, that what we now consider today as soap, is far from the soap that was used in ancient times as in the Middle Ages or even in more recent times. The objective of the product was exactly: to eliminate    the dirt from clothes and the human body, however its composition has    varied a lot.\nNatural artisan soaps are composed of animal fat or    oils such as olive oil, mixed together with an alkaline substance such    as, for example, sodium hydroxide (pure lye). However, soaps and    detergents contain synthetic chemical substances whose objectives are to    produce a large amount of foam. And as a result, foam has been related    to cleanliness even though this is in fact a complete myth.\nVirgin olive oil is perfect for the making of    homemade soaps\nThe origin of the name \"soap\" came much after the    origin of the product itself. Roman mythologic tradition relates the    origin of the name with Mount Sapo, situated close to the river Tíber in    Rome.  The story tells that it was in the on the side of this    mountain that the chemical reaction of saponification was first    produced, i.e. the rain water mixed with the ash and animal fat from    ritual animal sacrifices, giving birth the origin of soap. \nAnother custom exists that affirms    that the origin of the name prodeeds from the town of Savona, situated    close to Génova in Italy, where the first solid soap was made. Which    highlights the etymological similarity between the name of the town and    the French denomination of soap as \"savon\" and the italian \"sapone\".\n \nWe can't know    for sure which was the real origin of soap, however its origins can be    retraced. The first testimonial source made a reference to a soap-like    product from III millennium BC, in ancient Mesopotamia,    the land which was the origin of the great civilizations of mankind. Specifically in the Sumer region clay tablets appeared telling of the    mixture consisting in the boiling of oils with alkali, potassium,    sodium, resins and salt. This mixture was used mainly to treat the    textile fabrics such as wool and skin.\nClay tablet like the one located in Mesopotamia which refers to soap made with sodium,    oil and other items.\nAlso, from Ancient Egypt come testimonies related to soap substances or detergents, to make them they used fuller's earth, the natron and crushed lupins. They displayed references to mixtures made with oils and fats,    but the aim of these ointments was in fact medicinal. Similarly, in Phoenicia in the seventh century C. there is testimony to the use of soap, especially for cleaning cotton and wool.\nLike in all other    ancient societies, the classic civilization also used soap. One    can still witness the discovery of archaeological remains found in the Roman city of Pompeii,    which have been interpreted as a soap factory, dating from the II millennium BC.  According to the testimony of Pliny the Elder, author of the first century AD, he attests to the use of soap in one of his texts on the different types of soaps that women used to treat their hair. This author claimed that it was the Gauls who  invented soap in the fourth century BC.  It consisted in    a frothy liquid which was obtained by boiling oils with the water from    the washing of ashes. Another classical author who names soap in their texts is Galen, of the second century BC. This author identifies it as a product used for washing clothes and personal hygiene.    In spite of these mentionings, the Greeks and Romans more than soap,    used to use olive oil for their personal hygeine. They  smeared their bodies in olive    oil and sand and afterwards proceeded to remove the mixture along with    the dirt with a scraper called \"strigil\".\nUse of the \"strigil\"accompanied by a mixture of olive oil and sand. Athenian red-figure cup (460 BC)\nWith the fall of the Roman Empire and the barbarian    invasions the use of soap in Europe fell into decline. However, the    Muslim world continued investigations in the field and they were the    first to introduce lime to the ash lye, in fact, the word alkali derives    from the arab \"al-qali\", which meant ash.\nFrom the VIII - IX century throughout the Mediterranean basin, and even more focused in the regions of Marseilles,    Genoa, Savona and Venice, the soap industry began to flourish.  During the fifteenth century soaps made from olive oil    were on the rise, spreading across Europe, becoming the best form of    body care. These soaps were the precursors of today's soaps.  \n \nDEVELOPMENT\nOF SOAP    CRAFT:\nMany and varied procedures have been used in the making of soap. Here, we will examine the non-industrial production from two soap recipes that feature used olive oil as an ingredient.  When we reuse    virgin olive oil to cook various times it loses its properties and ends    up deteriorated. In this situation we can choose to get rid of it or recycle it. Traditionally, rural women in nineteenth and twentieth century used to whiten their clothes with soap that they made from used virgin olive oil with hot water and ash in their    households.\nThe soap-making    process is very simple and in addition it gives great results, offering    a creamy and efficient soap. Before you start, you need to put on rubber    gloves so that your hands will not come into contact with the sodium and    you must never use aluminium or tin recipients so as to prevent the    expellation of harmful fumes. \nVirgin olive oil is one of the three key ingredients for making homemade soap\n \nTradicional Soap Recipe:\nTo make this    recipe you need 3 litres of water, ½ kilo of caustic soda (sodium    hydroxide) and 3 litres of used virgin olive oil. The first step is to    mix in the recipient on the heat, the soda with the water and stir,    always in the same direction, until it dissolves. Next, add the olive    oil a little bit at a time until the mixture curdles.  This is when you can add items such as bleach so that the soap comes out whiter or scents of herbs and fruits to give you a nicer smell. As the mixture    gets colder it acquires a solid look and feel. The soap should be put in    a wooden or plastic container and left for a couple of days until it has    all solidified. Then you cut it into pieces and it is ready to use.\nArtisan soaps made from used extra virgin olive oil\n \nLiquid    Soap Recipe:\nThe recipe of this homemade soap is    very similar to the previous one, however, this one is of liquid soap    that can be put directly into the drawer of your washing machine. The    ingredients are 8 litres of water,  ¼ kilo of soda, a bottle of    liquid detergent, 2 litres of fabric softner and 2 litres of used olive    oil. The procedure is to dissolve all ingredients in large bowl and leave it to stand for 7 to 9 days in a row, during which you must stir regularly with a wooden tool. At the end of the 7 to 9 days, when the paste thickens acquiring the look and feel similar to liquid soap, it is ready. Then the soap can be distributed in reused bottles of fabric softener and soap.\nEste tipo de jabones artesanos a base de aceite de    oliva virgen extra queda totalmente disuelto en el agua y no deja restos    de residuos. This type of artisan soap, with an extra virgin olive oil base are completely dissolvable in water and leaves no residue remains. It is ideal for washing clothes and if used to wash floors it leaves a clean and shiny finish, that makes them look as if they had been waxed. It also helps protect the environment in being an organic soap.\n \nWomen washing clothes in the river with natural virgin olive oil based products",

The Cretan Kouritis brought and  planted the first olive tree in Olympia  and was the founder of the Olympic games.\nDactyls Hercules had four siblings. He was the oldest  one and he once took them to Olympia  for a running race. Dactyl Hercules crowned the winner with a twig from the  olive tree that he had planted there. Since then, people who won an Olympic event,  were crowned with an olive twig. From Olympia  the olive tree planting was expanded to the rest of ancient Greece.\nOlive trees had a sacred place amongst other plants in  Minoan art. Not only were they stored in special jars that were very hard to  make, they also had splendid wall art with their main topic being of course,  olive trees.\nAncient Greeks presumed olive trees as sacred, and  according to Aristotelis , anyone found destroying the trees was punished by  death. It was a symbol of peace and who ever offered it was accepted with  respect.\n \nSolon , when  published new laws, ensured the dramatic increase of oil production. Along with  the developing of the civilization, so were developed the importance of olive  trees and the laws protecting them. A new law Solon ensured was that whoever  dared to lay a hand on an olive tree, would be punished with death and  especially the holy olive trees the goddess Athena had offered to the city of Athens. Even if the tree was  withered and only its trunk remained, still, nobody could not touch it.\n \n \nDuring the Panathenaic races, organised to honour goddess  Athena, the winners of these races, except the wreath, got large quantities of  olive oil, which was usually sold to outsiders.\nEven though the governors of Athens strictly forbid exporting olive oil,  Pannathenean winners were allowed. This olive oil was then appeared all over Italy and Marseilles.  Olive oil was bought by wealthy young people,  who loved to apply themselves with this sacred oil that came to them in ancient  storage jars. Olive oil was probably the first branded agricultural product in  ancient world.\nIn the Greek ancient culture, the olive tree was the  tree of peace. Goddess Eirini (Greek word for peace) was pictured with an olive  branch placed in her hands. The best way of demonstrating peace during war  times was each war leader giving an olive branch to the other one.\nThe messengers, which were to broadcast a message of  peace to the enemy held an olive branch, and was respected by each and every  soldier of the enemy. It was the indisputable holy symbol that stated the  intents of the ones that had decided to send it.\n \nOLIVE OIL & HERBS: HEALTH  BENEFITS\nWithin the Hippocrates code, over sixty medical uses of olive oil can be  found, the most common are mainly for healing of dermatological diseases. Also,  olive oil is the base of the Hippocrates diet, in combination of course, with  wine and bread.\nIn his book «Dietology and Therapies», Hippocrates  mentions that: “using oil in winter helps the body remain warm, because it  stops the heat from escaping your body. In summer when you mix oil with water  and rub it on your body, it nourishes it and prevent overheating”.\nPlutarch in his book  ‘ethics’ refers to mastitis treatment with a mixture of olive oil and water,  also keeping gums  healthy and teeth  white.\nIn the temple   of Asklepius oil was used in order to   create ointments and medicines. Olive tea and olive flowers and their leaves   were used as medicine for stomach ache and for irritation of eyes.\nIn all the ancient books of Hippocrates (Hippocrates  collection), Theofrastus (History of plants), Dioscorides (About medicines),  Galenos etc gave great importance in the healing abilities of herbs and  trees.\nIn ancient medical treatments herbs, roots, leaves and  their essences were used among others as anti-fever, pain killers, anti-emetics,  psychotropic drugs, hypnotics and drugs."

                "The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, \"the books\"  ) is a collection of texts sacred in Judaism and Christianity. It is a collection of scriptures written at different times by different authors in different locations. Jews and Christians consider the books of the Bible to be a product of divine inspiration or an authoritative record of the relationship between God and humans.\n\nThe canonical Bible varies depending on traditions or groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents.  The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of narratives, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about the contents of the canon, primarily in the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect.\n\nAttitudes towards the Bible also vary amongst Christian groups. Roman Catholics, Anglicans and Eastern Orthodox Christians stress the harmony and importance of the Bible and sacred tradition, while Protestant churches focus on the idea of sola scriptura, or scripture alone. This concept arose during the Protestant Reformation, and many denominations today continue to support the use of the Bible as the only source of Christian teaching.\n\nWith estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, the Bible is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time.   It has estimated annual sales of 100 million copies,  and has been a major influence on literature and history, especially in the West where the Gutenberg Bible was the first mass-printed book. It was the first book ever printed using movable type.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English word Bible is from the Latin biblia, from the same word in Medieval Latin and Late Latin and ultimately from Koine Greek  ta biblia \"the books\" (singular  biblion). \n\nMedieval Latin biblia is short for biblia sacra \"holy book\", while biblia in Greek and Late Latin is neuter plural (gen. bibliorum). It gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun (biblia, gen. bibliae) in medieval Latin, and so the word was loaned as a singular into the vernaculars of Western Europe. \nLatin biblia sacra \"holy books\" translates Greek  ta biblia ta hagia, \"the holy books\". \n\nThe word  itself had the literal meaning of \"paper\" or \"scroll\" and came to be used as the ordinary word for \"book\".\nIt is the diminutive of  byblos, \"Egyptian papyrus\", possibly so called from the name of the Phoenician sea port Byblos (also known as Gebal) from whence Egyptian papyrus was exported to Greece.\nThe Greek ta biblia (lit. \"little papyrus books\")  was \"an expression Hellenistic Jews used to describe their sacred books (the Septuagint).   Christian use of the term can be traced to c. 223 CE. The biblical scholar F.F. Bruce notes that Chrysostom appears to be the first writer (in his Homilies on Matthew, delivered between 386 and 388) to use the Greek phrase ta biblia (\"the books\") to describe both the Old and New Testaments together. \n\nTextual history\n\n\t\nBy the 2nd century BCE, Jewish groups had called the Bible books the \"scriptures\" and referred to them as \"holy,\" or in Hebrew כִּתְבֵי הַקֹּדֶשׁ (Kitvei hakkodesh), and Christians now commonly call the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible \"The Holy Bible\" (in Greek , tà biblía tà ágia) or \"the Holy Scriptures\" (, e Agía Graphḗ).  The Bible was divided into chapters in the 13th century by Stephen Langton and into verses in the 16th century by French printer Robert Estienne  and is now usually cited by book, chapter, and verse. \n\nThe oldest extant copy of a complete Bible is an early 4th-century parchment book preserved in the Vatican Library, and known as the Codex Vaticanus. The oldest copy of the Tanakh in Hebrew and Aramaic dates to the 10th century CE. The oldest copy of a complete Latin (Vulgate) Bible is the Codex Amiatinus, dating from the 8th century. \n\nDevelopment\n\n \n\nProfessor John K. Riches, Professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow, in an Oxford University Press introduction to the Bible, says that \"the biblical texts themselves are the result of a creative dialogue between ancient traditions and different communities through the ages\",  and \"the biblical texts were produced over a period in which the living conditions of the writers – political, cultural, economic, and ecological – varied enormously\".  Timothy H. Lim, a professor of Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism at the University of Edinburgh, says that the Old Testament is \"a collection of authoritative texts of apparently divine origin that went through a human process of writing and editing.\"  He states that it is not a magical book, nor was it literally written by God and passed to mankind.\nParallel to the solidification of the Hebrew canon (c. 3rd century BCE), only the Torah first and then the Tanakh began to be translated into Greek and expanded, now referred to as the Septuagint or the Greek Old Testament. \n\nIn Christian Bibles, the New Testament Gospels were derived from oral traditions in the second half of the first century CE. Riches says that:\n\nScholars have attempted to reconstruct something of the history of the oral traditions behind the Gospels, but the results have not been too encouraging. The period of transmission is short: less than 40 years passed between the death of Jesus and the writing of Mark's Gospel. This means that there was little time for oral traditions to assume fixed form. \n\nThe Bible was later translated into Latin and other languages. John Riches states that:\n\nThe translation of the Bible into Latin marks the beginning of a parting of the ways between Western Latin-speaking Christianity and Eastern Christianity, which spoke Greek, Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and other languages. The Bibles of the Eastern Churches vary considerably: the Ethiopic Orthodox canon includes 81 books and contains many apocalyptic texts, such as were found at Qumran and subsequently excluded from the Jewish canon. As a general rule, one can say that the Orthodox Churches generally follow the Septuagint in including more books in their Old Testaments than are in the Jewish canon.\n\nHebrew Bible\n\nThe Masoretic Text is the authoritative Hebrew text of the Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh.  It defines the books of the Jewish canon, and also the precise letter-text of these biblical books, with their vocalization and accentuation.\n\nThe oldest extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century CE,  and the Aleppo Codex (once the oldest complete copy of the Masoretic Text, but now missing its Torah section) dates from the 10th century.\n\nThe name Tanakh (Hebrew: ) reflects the threefold division of the Hebrew Scriptures, Torah (\"Teaching\"), Nevi'im (\"Prophets\") and Ketuvim (\"Writings\").\n\nTorah\n\nThe Torah (תּוֹרָה) is also known as the \"Five Books of Moses\" or the Pentateuch, meaning \"five scroll-cases\".   \n\nThe Hebrew names of the books are derived from the first words in the respective texts. The Torah consists of the following five books:\n* Genesis, Beresheeth (בראשית)\n* Exodus, Shemot (שמות)\n* Leviticus, Vayikra (ויקרא)\n* Numbers, Bamidbar (במדבר)\n* Deuteronomy, Devarim (דברים)\n\nThe first eleven chapters of Genesis provide accounts of the creation (or ordering) of the world and the history of God's early relationship with humanity. The remaining thirty-nine chapters of Genesis provide an account of God's covenant with the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (also called Israel) and Jacob's children, the \"Children of Israel\", especially Joseph. It tells of how God commanded Abraham to leave his family and home in the city of Ur, eventually to settle in the land of Canaan, and how the Children of Israel later moved to Egypt. The remaining four books of the Torah tell the story of Moses, who lived hundreds of years after the patriarchs. He leads the Children of Israel from slavery in Ancient Egypt to the renewal of their covenant with God at Mount Sinai and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation was ready to enter the land of Canaan. The Torah ends with the death of Moses. \n\nThe Torah contains the commandments of God, revealed at Mount Sinai (although there is some debate among traditional scholars as to whether these were all written down at one time, or over a period of time during the 40 years of the wanderings in the desert, while several modern Jewish movements reject the idea of a literal revelation, and critical scholars believe that many of these laws developed later in Jewish history).     These commandments provide the basis for Jewish religious law. Tradition states that there are 613 commandments (taryag mitzvot).\n\nNevi'im\n\nNevi'im (, \"Prophets\") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the Torah and Ketuvim. It contains two sub-groups, the Former Prophets (, the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (, the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets).\n\nThe Nevi'im tell the story of the rise of the Hebrew monarchy and its division into two kingdoms, ancient Israel and Judah, focusing on conflicts between the Israelites and other nations, and conflicts among Israelites, specifically, struggles between believers in \"the  God\"  and believers in foreign gods,   and the criticism of unethical and unjust behavior of Israelite elites and rulers;    in which prophets played a crucial and leading role. It ends with the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians followed by the conquest of the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nFormer Prophets\n\nThe Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. They contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the Promised Land, and end with the release from imprisonment of the last king of Judah. Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:\n* Joshua's conquest of the land of Canaan (in the Book of Joshua),\n* the struggle of the people to possess the land (in the Book of Judges),\n* the people's request to God to give them a king so that they can occupy the land in the face of their enemies (in the Books of Samuel)\n* the possession of the land under the divinely appointed kings of the House of David, ending in conquest and foreign exile (Books of Kings)\n\nLatter Prophets\n\nThe Latter Prophets are divided into two groups, the \"major\" prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets, collected into a single book. The collection is broken up to form twelve individual books in the Christian Old Testament, one for each of the prophets:\n\n* Hosea, Hoshea (הושע)\n* Joel, Yoel (יואל)\n* Amos, Amos (עמוס)\n* Obadiah, Ovadyah (עבדיה)\n* Jonah, Yonah (יונה)\n* Micah, Mikhah (מיכה)\n* Nahum, Nahum (נחום)\n* Habakkuk, Havakuk (חבקוק)\n* Zephaniah, Tsefanya (צפניה)\n* Haggai, Khagay (חגי)\n* Zechariah, Zekharyah (זכריה)\n* Malachi, Malakhi (מלאכי)\n\nKetuvim\n\nKetuvim or Kəṯûḇîm (in  \"writings\") is the third and final section of the Tanakh. The Ketuvim are believed to have been written under the Ruach HaKodesh (the Holy Spirit) but with one level less authority than that of prophecy. \n\nThe poetic books\n\nIn Masoretic manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel stichs in the verses, which are a function of their poetry. Collectively, these three books are known as Sifrei Emet (an acronym of the titles in Hebrew, איוב, משלי, תהלים yields Emet אמ\"ת, which is also the Hebrew for \"truth\").\n\nThese three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of cantillation notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.\n\nThe five scrolls (Hamesh Megillot)\n\nThe five relatively short books of Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Book of Esther are collectively known as the Hamesh Megillot (Five Megillot). These are the latest books collected and designated as \"authoritative\" in the Jewish canon even though they were not complete until the 2nd century CE. \n\nOther books\n\nBesides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are Daniel, Ezra–Nehemiah and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics:\n* Their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e., the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion).\n* The Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them.\n* Two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in the Tanakh with significant portions in Aramaic.\n\nOrder of the books\n\nThe following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of Sifrei Emet and Hamesh Megillot.\n\nThe Three Poetic Books (Sifrei Emet)\n* Tehillim (Psalms) תְהִלִּים\n* Mishlei (Book of Proverbs) מִשְלֵי\n* Iyyôbh (Book of Job) אִיּוֹב\nThe Five Megillot (Hamesh Megillot)\n* Shīr Hashshīrīm (Song of Songs) or (Song of Solomon) שִׁיר הַשׁשִׁירִים (Passover)\n* Rūth (Book of Ruth) רוּת (Shābhû‘ôth)\n* Eikhah (Lamentations) איכה (Ninth of Av) [Also called Kinnot in Hebrew.]\n* Qōheleth (Ecclesiastes) קהלת (Sukkôth)\n* Estēr (Book of Esther) אֶסְתֵר (Pûrîm)\nOther books\n* Dānî’ēl (Book of Daniel) דָּנִיֵּאל\n* ‘Ezrā (Book of Ezra-Book of Nehemiah) עזרא\n* Divrei ha-Yamim (Chronicles) דברי הימים\n\nThe Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in Ketuvim. The Babylonian Talmud (Bava Batra 14b-15a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles. \n\nIn Tiberian Masoretic codices, including the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex, and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Esther, Daniel, Ezra. \n\nCanonization\n\nThe Ketuvim is the last of the three portions of the Tanakh to have been accepted as biblical canon. While the Torah may have been considered canon by Israel as early as the 5th century BCE and the Former and Latter Prophets were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century of the Common Era. \n\nEvidence suggests, however, that the people of Israel were adding what would become the Ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets. As early as 132 BCE references suggest that the Ketuvim was starting to take shape, although it lacked a formal title.  References in the four Gospels as well as other books of the New Testament indicate that many of these texts were both commonly known and counted as having some degree of religious authority early in the 1st century CE.\n\nMany scholars believe that the limits of the Ketuvim as canonized scripture were determined by the Council of Jamnia c. 90 CE. Against Apion, the writing of Josephus in 95 CE, treated the text of the Hebrew Bible as a closed canon to which \"... no one has ventured either to add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable...\"  For a long time following this date the divine inspiration of Esther, the Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes was often under scrutiny. \n\nOriginal languages\n\nThe Tanakh was mainly written in biblical Hebrew, with some small portions ( and , , ) in biblical Aramaic, a sister language which became the lingua franca for much of the Semitic world. \n\nSeptuagint \n\nThe Septuagint, or LXX, is a translation of the Hebrew Scriptures and some related texts into Koine Greek, begun in the late 3rd century BCE and completed by 132 BCE,   initially in Alexandria, but in time elsewhere as well.  It is not altogether clear which was translated when, or where; some may even have been translated twice, into different versions, and then revised. \n\nAs the work of translation progressed, the canon of the Greek Bible expanded. The Torah always maintained its pre-eminence as the basis of the canon but the collection of prophetic writings, based on the Nevi'im, had various hagiographical works incorporated into it. In addition, some newer books were included in the Septuagint, among these are the Maccabees and the Wisdom of Sirach. However, the book of Sirach, is now known to have existed in a Hebrew version, since ancient Hebrew manuscripts of it were rediscovered in modern times. The Septuagint version of some Biblical books, like Daniel and Esther, are longer than those in the Jewish canon.  Some of these deuterocanonical books (e.g. the Wisdom of Solomon, and the second book of Maccabees) were not translated, but composed directly in Greek.\n\nSince Late Antiquity, once attributed to a hypothetical late 1st-century Council of Jamnia, mainstream Rabbinic Judaism rejected the Septuagint as valid Jewish scriptural texts. Several reasons have been given for this. First, some mistranslations were claimed. Second, the Hebrew source texts used for the Septuagint differed from the Masoretic tradition of Hebrew texts, which was chosen as canonical by the Jewish rabbis.  Third, the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of Christianity.  \nFinally, the rabbis claimed a divine authority for the Hebrew language, in contrast to Aramaic or Greek – even though these languages were the lingua franca of Jews during this period (and Aramaic would eventually be given a holy language status comparable to Hebrew). \n\nThe Septuagint is the basis for the Old Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Old Armenian, Old Georgian and Coptic versions of the Christian Old Testament.  The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches use most of the books of the Septuagint, while Protestant churches usually do not. After the Protestant Reformation, many Protestant Bibles began to follow the Jewish canon and exclude the additional texts, which came to be called Biblical apocrypha. The Apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the King James Version of the Bible, the basis for the Revised Standard Version. \n\nIncorporations from Theodotion\n\nIn most ancient copies of the Bible which contain the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, the Book of Daniel is not the original Septuagint version, but instead is a copy of Theodotion's translation from the Hebrew, which more closely resembles the Masoretic Text. The Septuagint version was discarded in favour of Theodotion's version in the 2nd to 3rd centuries CE. In Greek-speaking areas, this happened near the end of the 2nd century, and in Latin-speaking areas (at least in North Africa), it occurred in the middle of the 3rd century. History does not record the reason for this, and St. Jerome reports, in the preface to the Vulgate version of Daniel, \"This thing 'just' happened.\"  One of two Old Greek texts of the Book of Daniel has been recently rediscovered and work is ongoing in reconstructing the original form of the book. \n\nThe canonical Ezra–Nehemiah is known in the Septuagint as \"Esdras B\", and 1 Esdras is \"Esdras A\". 1 Esdras is a very similar text to the books of Ezra–Nehemiah, and the two are widely thought by scholars to be derived from the same original text. It has been proposed, and is thought highly likely by scholars, that \"Esdras B\" – the canonical Ezra–Nehemiah – is Theodotion's version of this material, and \"Esdras A\" is the version which was previously in the Septuagint on its own.\n\nFinal form\n\nSome texts are found in the Septuagint but are not present in the Hebrew. These additional books are Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah (which later became chapter 6 of Baruch in the Vulgate), additions to Daniel (The Prayer of Azarias, the Song of the Three Children, Susanna and Bel and the Dragon), additions to Esther, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Odes, including the Prayer of Manasseh, the Psalms of Solomon, and Psalm 151.\n\nSome books that are set apart in the Masoretic Text are grouped together. For example, the Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings are in the LXX one book in four parts called Βασιλειῶν (\"Of Reigns\"). In LXX, the Books of Chronicles supplement Reigns and it is called Paralipomenon (Παραλειπομένων—things left out). The Septuagint organizes the minor prophets as twelve parts of one Book of Twelve.\n\nChristian Bibles\n\nA Christian Bible is a set of books that a Christian denomination regards as divinely inspired and thus constituting scripture. Although the Early Church primarily used the Septuagint or the Targums among Aramaic speakers, the apostles did not leave a defined set of new scriptures; instead the canon of the New Testament developed over time. Groups within Christianity include differing books as part of their sacred writings, most prominent among which are the biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical books.\n\nSignificant versions of the English Christian Bible include the Douay-Rheims Bible, the Authorized King James Version, the English Revised Version, the American Standard Version, the Revised Standard Version,  the New American Standard Version, the New King James Version, the New International Version, and the English Standard Version.\n\nOld Testament\n\nThe books which make up the Christian Old Testament differ between the Catholic (see Catholic Bible), Orthodox, and Protestant (see Protestant Bible) churches, with the Protestant movement accepting only those books contained in the Hebrew Bible, while Catholics and Orthodox have wider canons. A few groups consider particular translations to be divinely inspired, notably the Greek Septuagint and the Aramaic Peshitta.\n\nApocryphal or deuterocanonical books\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, translations based on the Septuagint still prevail. The Septuagint was generally abandoned in favour of the 10th-century Masoretic Text as the basis for translations of the Old Testament into Western languages. Some modern Western translations since the 14th century make use of the Septuagint to clarify passages in the Masoretic Text, where the Septuagint may preserve a variant reading of the Hebrew text. They also sometimes adopt variants that appear in other texts, e.g., those discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.  \n\nA number of books which are part of the Peshitta or Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew (Rabbinic) Bible (i.e., among the protocanonical books) are often referred to as deuterocanonical books by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e., deutero) canon, that canon as fixed definitively by the Council of Trent 1545–1563.   It includes 46 books for the Old Testament (45 if Jeremiah and Lamentations are counted as one) and 27 for the New.\n\nMost Protestants term these books as apocrypha. Modern Protestant traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles included them in Apocrypha sections until the 1820s. However, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church recognizes: \n* Tobit\n* Judith\n* 1 Maccabees\n* 2 Maccabees\n* Wisdom\n* Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)\n* Baruch\n* The Letter of Jeremiah (Baruch Chapter 6)\n* Greek Additions to Esther (Book of Esther, chapters 10:4 – 12:6)\n* The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children verses 1–68 (Book of Daniel, chapter 3, verses 24–90)\n* Susanna (Book of Daniel, chapter 13)\n* Bel and the Dragon (Book of Daniel, chapter 14)\n\nIn addition to those, the Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches recognize the following: \n* 3 Maccabees\n* 1 Esdras\n* Prayer of Manasseh\n* Psalm 151\n\nRussian and Georgian Orthodox Churches include:\n* 2 Esdras i.e., Latin Esdras in the Russian and Georgian Bibles\n\nThere is also 4 Maccabees which is only accepted as canonical in the Georgian Church, but was included by St. Jerome in an appendix to the Vulgate, and is an appendix to the Greek Orthodox Bible, and it is therefore sometimes included in collections of the Apocrypha.\n\nThe Syriac Orthodox tradition includes:\n* Psalms 151–155\n* The Apocalypse of Baruch\n* The Letter of Baruch\n\nThe Ethiopian Biblical canon includes:\n* Jubilees\n* Enoch\n* 1–3 Meqabyan\nand some other books.\n\nThe Anglican Church uses some of the Apocryphal books liturgically. Therefore, editions of the Bible intended for use in the Anglican Church include the Deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church, plus 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, which were in the Vulgate appendix. \n\nPseudepigraphal books \n\nThe term Pseudepigrapha commonly describes numerous works of Jewish religious literature written from about 300 BCE to 300 CE. Not all of these works are actually pseudepigraphical. It also refers to books of the New Testament canon whose authorship is misrepresented. The \"Old Testament\" Pseudepigraphal works include the following:Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.\n\n* 3 Maccabees\n* 4 Maccabees\n* Assumption of Moses\n* Ethiopic Book of Enoch (1 Enoch)\n* Slavonic Book of Enoch (2 Enoch)\n* Hebrew Book of Enoch (3 Enoch) (also known as \"The Revelation of Metatron\" or \"The Book of Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest\")\n* Book of Jubilees\n* Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch (2 Baruch)\n* Letter of Aristeas  (Letter to Philocrates regarding the translating of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek)\n* Life of Adam and Eve\n* Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah\n* Psalms of Solomon\n* Sibylline Oracles\n* Greek Apocalypse of Baruch (3 Baruch)\n* Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs\n\nBook of Enoch \n\nNotable pseudepigraphal works include the Books of Enoch (such as 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, surviving only in Old Slavonic, and 3 Enoch, surviving in Hebrew, c. 5th to 6th century CE). These are ancient Jewish religious works, traditionally ascribed to the prophet Enoch, the great-grandfather of the patriarch Noah. They are not part of the biblical canon used by Jews, apart from Beta Israel. Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books of Enoch as having some historical or theological interest or significance. It has been observed that part of the Book of Enoch is quoted in the Epistle of Jude (part of the New Testament) but Christian denominations generally regard the Books of Enoch as non-canonical or non-inspired.  However, the Enoch books are treated as canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\n\nThe older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300 BC, and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably was composed at the end of the 1st century BCE. \n\nDenominational views of Pseudepigrapha \n\nThere arose in some Protestant biblical scholarship an extended use of the term pseudepigrapha for works that appeared as though they ought to be part of the biblical canon, because of the authorship ascribed to them, but which stood outside both the biblical canons recognized by Protestants and Catholics. These works were also outside the particular set of books that Roman Catholics called deuterocanonical and to which Protestants had generally applied the term Apocryphal. Accordingly, the term pseudepigraphical, as now used often among both Protestants and Roman Catholics (allegedly for the clarity it brings to the discussion), may make it difficult to discuss questions of pseudepigraphical authorship of canonical books dispassionately with a lay audience. To confuse the matter even more, Eastern Orthodox Christians accept books as canonical that Roman Catholics and most Protestant denominations consider pseudepigraphical or at best of much less authority. There exist also churches that reject some of the books that Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants accept. The same is true of some Jewish sects. Many works that are \"apocryphal\" are otherwise considered genuine.\n\nRole of Old Testament in Christian theology\n\nThe Old Testament has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar N.T. Wright says \"Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures.\"  He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the \"holy writings\" of the Israelites as necessary and instructive for the Christian, as seen from Paul's words to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15), and as pointing to the Messiah, and as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus himself, generating the \"new covenant\" prophesied by Jeremiah. \n\nNew Testament\n\nThe New Testament is a collection of 27 books  of 4 different genres of Christian literature (Gospels, one account of the Acts of the Apostles, Epistles and an Apocalypse). Jesus is its central figure. The New Testament presupposes the inspiration of the Old Testament. (2 Timothy 3:16) Nearly all Christians recognize the New Testament as canonical scripture. These books can be grouped into:\n\nThe Gospels\n* Synoptic Gospels\n** Gospel According to Matthew\n** Gospel According to Mark\n** Gospel According to Luke\n* Gospel According to John\n\nNarrative literature, account and history of the Apostolic age\n* Acts of the Apostles\n\nPauline Epistles\n* Epistle to the Romans\n* First Epistle to the Corinthians\n* Second Epistle to the Corinthians\n* Epistle to the Galatians\n* Epistle to the Ephesians\n* Epistle to the Philippians\n* Epistle to the Colossians\n* First Epistle to the Thessalonians\n* Second Epistle to the Thessalonians\n\nPastoral epistles\n* First Epistle to Timothy\n* Second Epistle to Timothy\n* Epistle to Titus\n* Epistle to Philemon\n* Epistle to the Hebrews\n\nGeneral epistles, also called catholic epistles\n* Epistle of James\n* First Epistle of Peter\n* Second Epistle of Peter\n* First Epistle of John\n* Second Epistle of John\n* Third Epistle of John\n* Epistle of Jude\n\nApocalyptic literature, also called Prophetical\n* Revelation, or the Apocalypse\n\nThe New Testament books are ordered differently in the Catholic/Orthodox/Protestant tradition, the Slavonic tradition, the Syriac tradition and the Ethiopian tradition.\n\nOriginal language\n\nThe mainstream consensus is that the New Testament was written in a form of Koine Greek,   which was the common language of the Eastern Mediterranean     from the Conquests of Alexander the Great (335–323 BCE) until the evolution of Byzantine Greek (c. 600).\n\nHistoric editions\n\nThe original autographs, that is, the original Greek writings and manuscripts written by the original authors of the New Testament, have not survived.  But historically  copies exist of those original autographs, transmitted and preserved in a number of manuscript traditions.  There have been some minor variations, additions or omissions, in some of the texts. When ancient scribes copied earlier books, they sometimes wrote notes on the margins of the page (marginal glosses) to correct their text—especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line—and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions and additions. \n\nThe three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the Alexandrian text-type (generally minimalist), the Byzantine text-type (generally maximalist), and the Western text-type (occasionally wild). Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts.\n\nDevelopment of the Christian canons\n\nThe Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of synods produced a list of texts equal to the 39, 46(51),54, or 57 book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the Synod of Hippo in 393 CE. Also c. 400, Jerome produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see Vulgate), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.\n\nThe Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon—the number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division—while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Churches recognise 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 in addition to the Catholic canon. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognises a longer canon. The term \"Hebrew Scriptures\" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew. Both Catholics and Protestants (as well as Greek Orthodox) have the same 27-book New Testament Canon. \n\nThe New Testament writers assumed the inspiration of the Old Testament, probably earliest stated in , \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God\".\n\nEthiopian Orthodox canon\n\nThe Canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is wider than the canons used by most other Christian churches. There are 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. The Ethiopian Old Testament Canon includes the books found in the Septuagint accepted by other Orthodox Christians, in addition to Enoch and Jubilees which are ancient Jewish books that only survived in Ge'ez but are quoted in the New Testament, also Greek Ezra First and the Apocalypse of Ezra, 3 books of Meqabyan, and Psalm 151 at the end of the Psalter. The three books of Meqabyan are not to be confused with the books of Maccabees. The order of the other books is somewhat different from other groups', as well. The Old Testament follows the Septuagint order for the Minor Prophets rather than the Jewish order.\n\nDivine inspiration\n\nThe Second Epistle to Timothy says that \"all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness\". ()  Various related but distinguisahle views on divine inspiration include:\n\n* the view of the Bible as the inspired word of God: the belief that God, through the Holy Spirit, intervened and influenced the words, message, and collation of the Bible  \n* the view that the Bible is also infallible, and incapable of error in matters of faith and practice, but not necessarily in historic or scientific matters\n* the view that the Bible represents the inerrant word of God, without error in any aspect, spoken by God and written down in its perfect form by humans\n\nWithin these broad beliefs many schools of hermeneutics operate. \"Bible scholars claim that discussions about the Bible must be put into its context within church history and then into the context of contemporary culture.\" Fundamentalist Christians are associated with the doctrine of biblical literalism, where the Bible is not only inerrant, but the meaning of the text is clear to the average reader. \n\nJewish antiquity attests to belief in sacred texts,   and a similar belief emerges in the earliest of Christian writings. Various texts of the Bible mention divine agency in relation to its writings.  In their book A General Introduction to the Bible, Norman Geisler and William Nix write: \"The process of inspiration is a mystery of the providence of God, but the result of this process is a verbal, plenary, inerrant, and authoritative record.\"  Most evangelical biblical scholars    associate inspiration with only the original text; for example some American Protestants adhere to the 1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy which asserted that inspiration applied only to the autographic text of Scripture.  Among adherents of Biblical literalism, a minority, such as followers of the King-James-Only Movement, extend the claim of inerrancy only to a particular translation. \n\nVersions and translations\n\nThe original texts of the Tanakh were mainly in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic. In addition to the authoritative Masoretic Text, Jews still refer to the Septuagint, the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, and the Targum Onkelos, an Aramaic version of the Bible. There are several different ancient versions of the Tanakh in Hebrew, mostly differing by spelling, and the traditional Jewish version is based on the version known as Aleppo Codex. Even in this version there are words which are traditionally read differently from written, because the oral tradition is considered more fundamental than the written one, and presumably mistakes had been made in copying the text over the generations.\n\nThe primary biblical text for early Christians was the Septuagint. In addition, they translated the Hebrew Bible into several other languages. Translations were made into Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and Latin, among other languages. The Latin translations were historically the most important for the Church in the West, while the Greek-speaking East continued to use the Septuagint translations of the Old Testament and had no need to translate the New Testament.\n\nThe earliest Latin translation was the Old Latin text, or Vetus Latina, which, from internal evidence, seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time. It was based on the Septuagint, and thus included books not in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nPope Damasus I assembled the first list of books of the Bible at the Council of Rome in 382 CE. He commissioned Saint Jerome to produce a reliable and consistent text by translating the original Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin. This translation became known as the Latin Vulgate Bible, in the fourth century CE. And in 1546, at the Council of Trent, Jerome's Vulgate translation was declared by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only authentic and official Bible in the Latin Church.\n\nSince the Protestant Reformation, Bible translations for many languages have been made. The Bible continues to be translated to new languages, largely by Christian organisations such as Wycliffe Bible Translators, New Tribes Mission and Bible societies.\n\nViews\n\nJohn Riches, professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow, provides the following view of the diverse historical influences of the Bible:\n\nIt has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art; it has equally fuelled some of the worst excesses of human savagery, self-interest, and narrow-mindedness. It has inspired men and women to acts of great service and courage, to fight for liberation and human development; and it has provided the ideological fuel for societies which have enslaved their fellow human beings and reduced them to abject poverty. ... It has, perhaps above all, provided a source of religious and moral norms which have enabled communities to hold together, to care for, and to protect one another; yet precisely this strong sense of belonging has in turn fuelled ethnic, racial, and international tension and conflict. \n\nOther religions\n\nIn Islam, the Bible is held to reflect true unfolding revelation from God; but revelation which had been corrupted or distorted (in Arabic: tahrif); which necessitated the giving of the Qur'an to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, to correct this deviation.\n\nMembers of other religions may also seek inspiration from the Bible. For example, Rastafaris view the Bible as essential to their religion  and Unitarian Universalists view it as \"one of many important religious texts\". \n\nBiblical studies\n\nBiblical criticism refers to the investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention. It is not the same as criticism of the Bible, which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance, or observations that the Bible may have translation errors. \n\nHigher criticism\n\nIn the 17th century Thomas Hobbes collected the current evidence to conclude outright that Moses could not have written the bulk of the Torah. Shortly afterwards the philosopher Baruch Spinoza published a unified critical analysis, arguing that the problematic passages were not isolated cases that could be explained away one by one, but pervasive throughout the five books, concluding that it was \"clearer than the sun at noon that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses . . .\"  \n\nArchaeological and historical research\n\nBiblical archaeology is the archaeology that relates to and sheds light upon the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures (or \"New Testament\"). It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times. There are a wide range of interpretations in the field of biblical archaeology. One broad division includes biblical maximalism which generally takes the view that most of the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible is based on history although it is presented through the religious viewpoint of its time. It is considered the opposite of biblical minimalism which considers the Bible a purely post-exilic (5th century BCE and later) composition. Even among those scholars who adhere to biblical minimalism, the Bible is a historical document containing first-hand information on the Hellenistic and Roman eras, and there is universal scholarly consensus that the events of the 6th century BCE Babylonian captivity have a basis in history.\n\nThe historicity of the biblical account of the history of ancient Israel and Judah of the 10th to 7th centuries BCE is disputed in scholarship. The biblical account of the 8th to 7th centuries BCE is widely, but not universally, accepted as historical, while the verdict on the earliest period of the United Monarchy (10th century BCE) and the historicity of David is unclear. Archaeological evidence providing information on this period, such as the Tel Dan Stele, can potentially be decisive. The biblical account of events of the Exodus from Egypt in the Torah, and the migration to the Promised Land and the period of Judges are not considered historical in scholarship.  \n\nBibles Gallery\n\nFile:Bibel Kloster Paleokastritsa.jpg|Old Bible from a Greek monastery\nFile:Imperial Bible.jpg|  Imperial Bible, or Vienna Coronation Gospels from Wien (Austria), c 1500.\nFile:Kennicott Bible.jpg |The Kennicott Bible, 1476\nFile:A religious Baroque Bible - 7558.jpg|A Baroque Bible\nFile:Lincoln inaugural bible.jpg |The bible used by Abraham Lincoln for his oath of office during his first inauguration in 1861\nFile:Bible and Key Divination.jpg|A miniature Bible\nFile:19th century Victorian living room, Auckland - 0843.jpg|19th century Victorian Bible\nFile:Bizzell Bible Collection.jpg |Shelves of the Bizzell Bible Collection at Bizzell Memorial Library \n\nIllustrations\n\nMost old Bibles were illuminated, they were  manuscripts in which the text is supplemented by the addition of decoration, such as decorated initials, borders (marginalia) and miniature illustrations. \nUp to the twelfth century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a commission from a wealthy patron. Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the monks who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a scriptorium, where “separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk.”   \nBy the fourteenth century, the cloisters of monks writing in the scriptorium started to  employ laybrothers from the urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands.    \nDemand for manuscripts grew to an extent that the Monastic libraries were unable to meet with the demand, and began employing secular scribes and illuminators.  These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in certain instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day. \n\nThe manuscript was “sent to the rubricator, who added (in red or other colors) the titles, headlines, the initials of chapters and sections, the notes and so on; and then – if the book was to be illustrated – it was sent to the illuminator.”  In the case of manuscripts that were sold commercially, the writing would “undoubtedly have been discussed initially between the patron and the scribe (or the scribe’s agent,) but by the time that the written gathering were sent off to the illuminator there was no longer any scope for innovation.” \n\nFile:Bible chartraine - BNF Lat116 f193.jpg|Bible from 1150, from Scriptorium de Chartres, Christ with angels\nFile:Bible of St Louis detail.jpg |Blanche of Castile and Louis IX of France Bible, 13th century\nFile:Bible moralisée - Vienne Cod.1179 -frontispice.jpg| Bible moralisée : Christ  the architect of the Universe. \nFile:Maciejowski Bible Leaf 37 3.jpg| Maciejowski Bible, Leaf 37, the 3rd image, Abner (in the center in green) sends Michal back to David.\n\nFile:Jephthah's daughter laments - Maciejowski Bible.JPG|Jephthah's daughter laments - Maciejowski Bible (France, ca. 1250)\nFile:Whore-babylon-luther-bible-1534.jpg|Colored version of the Whore of Babylon illustration from Martin Luther's 1534 translation of the Bible. \nFile:Malnazar - Bible - Google Art Project.jpg |An Armenian Bible, illuminated by Malnazar, Armenian) illuminator.\n\nFile:Foster Bible Pictures 0031-1.jpg|Fleeing Sodom and Gomorrah, Foster Bible"

                "Bruce Springsteen (Music) - TV Tropes\nBruce Springsteen\nYou need to login to do this. Get Known if you don't have an account\nShare\nWMG\n\"Cuz tramps like us, baby, we were born to run.\"\nBruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949), nicknamed \"The Boss\", is one of the most notable singer-songwriters to come out of the 1970s . Perhaps his most well-known albums are Born to Run (1975) and Born in the USA (1984). Alongside his backing group the E Street Band, the membership of which has remained mostly constant throughout the years, Springsteen is best known for a \"heartland rock\" style that features themes of Americana, working-class desperation in an age of cynicism, and hope for a better life. Despite his associations with liberal politics and John Kerry in particular, his songs have sometimes been appropriated by conservative politicians, oftentimes without his permission. The most glaring example is the song \"Born in the USA\", which despite its title is not an unequivocal celebration of that country, but rather a condemnation of its treatment of Vietnam veterans. When Ronald Reagan tried to use the song for his reelection campaign in 1984, Springsteen famously told the President that he couldn't use it.\nDespite his most well-known work being produced in the '70s and '80s , he is still recording today. His latest album, High Hopes, was released in 2014. He also campaigned for Barack Obama during the 2008 American presidential campaign and performed at the inauguration.\nSpringsteen is also notable for helping to launch Courteney Cox 's career when she appeared in his video for \"Dancing in the Dark.\"\n, after reading the books to his son, and tried to get it into the movie.\nStudio discography\nGreetings from Asbury Park, N.J. (1972)^\nThe Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle (1973)^\nDarkness on the Edge of Town (1978)^\nThe River (1980)^\nBorn in the U.S.A. (1984)^\nTunnel of Love (1987)^\nThe Ghost of Tom Joad (1995)\nThe Rising (2002)^\nWe Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (2006)\nMagic (2007)^\nWorking on a Dream (2009)^\nWrecking Ball (2012)^\n^=with the E Street Band\n\"Tropes like us, baby we were born to run!\":\nAcademy Award : Won one for his 1993 song Streets of Philadelphia , the title tune of the film Philadelphia .\nAesop Amnesia : In 1984, President Reagan famously wanted to use \"Born in the USA\" his campaign song, prompting Springsteen to note that the song's lyrics weren't quite as upbeat many people believed the chorus to be and that it was actually a mournful song about veterans (including some of Bruce's friends) who went through the Vietnam War. In a similar vein, Independence Day celebrations have often used the song. And Bruce will publicly have to explain once again how the song is about how poorly Vietnam veterans (and the working class in general) were treated.\nAge Progression Song : Arguably \"Outlaw Pete\", albeit slightly nastier than most of these usually are.\nAll Drummers Are Animals : Averted with the chilled-out Max Weinberg, but the original E Street drummer, Vini Lopez, was nicknamed \"Mad Dog\".\nAll Just a Dream : A verse in \"Downbound Train\"\nAnd Now For Something Completely Different : Nebraska was a departure: Three Chords and the Truth by Springsteen on his own instead of the earlier full band backing and dark, political songs. Not quite a New Sound Album , though, as it was followed by Born in the USA...\nWe Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions. Bruce put together an entirely new band and recorded a selection of traditional folk songs like \"Old Man Tucker\", \"Eyes on the Prize\", \"John Henry\" and \"Mary Don't You Weep\". The end product is one of his most rocking albums in recent years.\nWrecking Ball proved to be quite a surprise for early listeners. Traces of gospel, Celtic folk, hip-hop beats and big horns collide in a messy combination, featuring some of his angriest lyrics in years. It just works.\nAnd Starring : When he introduces the members of the E Street Band in concert, he always saved saxophone player Clarence Clemons (\"The Big Man\") for last, usually shouting, \"And last but not least...\" In his 2000 Live from New York City album, the band intros take place between verses two and three of \"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\", as Springsteen shouts, \"Do I have to say his name?\" while the rest of the band leads the audience in chanting \"CLAR-ence! CLAR-ence!\", segueing seamlessly into the first line in verse three, \"The change was made uptown and the Big Man joined the band!\" Clemons' untimely passing may mean the end of this tradition...\nIn performances since Clemons's death, the band stops playing after this line, giving way to a couple minutes of silent footage of Clemons performing on the overhead monitors.\nArc Words : 'Magic' reappears a lot throughout his discography, culminating in the album Magic and being mentioned in multiple songs therein (including the Title Track ).\nArtistic Stimulation : The Seeger Sessions is a mild form of this. The bonus DVD shows Bruce encouraging his fellow musicians to drink whiskey and beer so that their background vocals will sound \"wild.\"\nBallad of X : \"Ballad of Elmer and Pea,\" \"Ballad of Jesse James,\" \"Ballad of the Self-Loading Pistol\"\nBawdy Song : \"Red Headed Woman\".\nBig Name Fan : Being one of the most prominent singer-songwriters in America, Bruce not surprisingly has quite a few. Special mention goes to fellow New Jerseyans Jon Stewart (who spoke in Bruce's honor when Bruce was being honored at the 2009 Kennedy Center Awards) and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has attended more than 129 Spingsteen concerts and fanboys about Springsteen frequently. It's been said that Governor Christie had a huge fanboy reaction when Springsteen—in the wake of shared relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy—told Christie \"Okay, we are officially friends.\" (This is kind of interesting, since Springsteen is well noted as being very liberal and a solid supporter of the Democrats—and gets super annoyed when Republicans use his music—while Christie is a Republican and as conservative as you can get and get elected in New Jersey. But then—it's clear both love their home state, so it really shouldn't be surprising.)\nBruce himself is apparently this for the Harry Potter novels, and even wrote a ballad about Harry, and tried to get it into the movies, being unsuccessful only because of Harry Potter novelist/creator JK Rowling's contractual stipulation that no commercial songs of any type be used in the Harry Potter film series.\nBowdlerize : Tom Waits ' \"Jersey Girl\" originally included the line \"Don't want no whores on Eighth Avenue.\" Bruce changed it to \"Or the girls out on the avenue.\"\nBreakout Character : E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg is probably the most successful, being just as well known for his work as bandleader of the house band for NBC 's Late Night/The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien .\nIn addition, lead guitarist Steven Van Zandt is also pretty successful as well, being just as well known for his role as Silvio Dante on the HBO drama The Sopranos , and for his long-running weekly radio show \"Little Steven's Underground Garage\".\nBreakthrough Hit : \"Born to Run\".\nBreakaway Pop Hit : \"Streets of Philadelphia\" is a well known and well received song, which won Springsteen an Oscar, in addition to being the song for the (also well received) movie Philadelphia .\nCall Back : Possibly crossed with Bookends , but on Born to Run the title track is a Call Back to \"Thunder Road\", albeit more upbeat and hopeful, whereas \"Jungleland\" is a Call Back to \"Backstreets\" although where \"Backstreets\" has a hopeful ending \"Jungleland\"... doesn't.\nIn \"Long Time Comin'\" from 2005's Devils and Dust, the narrator is married to a woman named Rosie. After the album's release, there was some speculation that \"Rosie\" is actually the title character from \"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\"; she's just grown up now.\nCheap Pop : Parodied with the joke song \"In Michigan\"\n, performed at two shows there in September 1996.\nChristmas Songs : The Boss' cover of \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\", based on Phil Spector's arrangement for the Crystals , is a classic rock radio standard during Christmastime.\nDitto for \"Merry Christmas, Baby!\"\nCliché Storm : Invoked and parodied with \"My Best Was Never Good Enough,\" where the lyrics, except for the title and \"Come'on pretty baby, call my bluff\" are nothing but\nclichés, including a Take That to Forrest Gump .\n\"Now life's like a box of chocolates\nYou never know what you're gonna get\nStupid is as stupid does and all the rest of that shit.\"\nCool Car : Cars are often means of escape and objects of desire for his protagonists.\n\"Ramrod\": \"She's a hot stepping hemi with a four on the floor / She's a roadrunner engine in a '32 Ford...\"\n\"Cadillac Ranch\": \"Cadillac, Cadillac / Long and dark, shiny and black / Open up your engines, let 'em roar / Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur...\"\n\"Pink Cadillac\": \"Crushed velvet seats, ridin' in the back, oozin' down the streets, wavin' to the girls, feelin' outta sight...\"\nSubverted in \"Racing In The Streets\", about a guy who's sunk all of his dreams in a Cool Car that's never going anywhere.\nInverted in \"The Line\", in which border police use their cars as weapons against illegal immigrants (\"We'd rush 'em with our Broncos...\") and \"Balboa Park\", in which the protagonist is hit and probably killed by a car.\nAlso inverted in \"Used Cars,\" in which the child narrator is ashamed of his family's poverty and how they can't afford a new car. They always have to buy secondhand cars and even that is a strain on their finances.\nNow mister the day the lottery I win\nI ain't ever gonna ride in no used car again\nCool Old Guy : He's hit sixty-two years old, and he sounds as good as ever, if not better.\nClarence Clemons, who was still playing with the band right before he died at the age of 69, also counts.\nCrapsack World : The overlying theme of his 1982 album Nebraska.\nCreator Breakdown : His 1987 album ''Tunnel Of Love\" chronicles the falling apart of his first marriage to actress Julianne Phillips.\nDowner Ending : Several of his songs, notably Jungleland.\nDying Town : \"My Hometown\" and \"Youngstown\". Based in large part on the economic turmoil that hit Bruce's hometown of Freehold, NJ and other towns that suffered with the loss of factory jobs during the postwar decades.\nAnd of course, \"Death to my Hometown\" from 2012's Wrecking Ball.\n\"Frankie\" from Tracks contains the line, \"Everybody's dying, this town's closing down.\"\nEagleland : Most of his songs are meditations on American small towns, culture, politics etc. Usually coming in type 3 but with a few songs like \"Born in the USA\" closer in tone to 2 when discussing topics like the ill treatment received by the Vietnam Veterans or the existence of political corruption. That being said, his recent album \"Wrecking Ball\" goes back to Type 3: Despite the existence of corrupt powers-that-be, the album ultimately suggests that in the end the good will triumph, and Bruce celebrates the American small towns and urban centers that he hopes will recover from the current economic turmoil.\nEarn Your Happy Ending : Appears in some of his songs, notably \"Badlands\" and \"Land of Hopes and Dreams\".\nIn the album \"Live In New York City\" (also available on DVD), during \"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\", he did his \"Gospel of Rock and Roll\" routine during an extended bridge between the second and third verses , telling his audience that hope, happiness, companionship, a second chance, and all of life's blessings could be theirs. \"But you gotta work at it!\"\nEpic Rocking : Not so much with album versions, but there are some exceptions. \"Drive All Night\",\"Outlaw Pete\" and \"Jungleland\" are all around the 8-minute mark, but his longest to date is \"New York Serenade\", at nearly 10 minutes long. Live performances are a different matter, though - live renditions of \"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\", \"E Street Shuffle\" or especially \"Kitty's Back\" (their dedicated \"jamming song\", where everyone gets a chance to solo) can stretch to 20 minutes.\nExactly What It Says on the Tin : The album 18 Tracks, a collection of 18 tracks.\nFan Disservice : The graphic sex scene in \"Reno\" is creepy and sad, and fully meant to be so.\nFor the Evulz : The narrator of \"The New Timer\" blames his friend's murder on \"somebody killing just to kill.\"\nForeshadowing : A number of songs on The River. The title track, for example, presaged the themes he would devote Nebraska to.\nFortune Teller : \"4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\": \"The cops finally busted Madame Marie, for telling fortunes better than they do.\" This referred to a real-life Asbury Park fortune teller named Marie Castello , who once told Springsteen he would be a great success as a musician.\n\"Brilliant Disguise\": \"We stood at the altar / the gypsy swore our future was right / But come the wee wee hours / Well maybe baby the gypsy lied.\"\nGlory Days : The Trope Namer . The song itself is a reflection on high school memories.\nInsult Backfire :\nHis 1984 hit \"Born In the USA\" is about the negative effect the Vietnam War had on working class Americans and criticizes how the US government feels it needs to \"police the world\". However, it has been frequently misinterpreted as a patriotic anthem and was embraced by a number of nationalist figures during The '80s who were oblivious to the song's true meaning. Most notably, Ronald Reagan wanted to use the song for his 1984 reelection campaign (which Springsteen openly mocked him for) and Lee Iacocca wanted to use the song in a patriotically themed advertising campaign for Chrysler automobiles. Naturally, Springsteen refused to allow either to use the song.\nHis song Glory Days is often used at high school reunions and is embraced as a lighthearted tale of those reminiscing of their youth. However, the song is really about a group of high school classmates who are down-on-their-luck losers that have gone nowhere in life since their graduation. However, all of them were popular and really had things going for them back during their school days, so they regularly get together, get drunk and reminisce about their time in high school to feel better about themselves and forget about how pitiful their lives currently are.\nIntercourse with You : \"I'm On Fire\". Fittingly enough, it was later covered by AWOLNATION for the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack.\nI Thought It Meant : Sweet Jenny, whom Bruce mentions in his song \"Youngstown\" is not the protagonist's wife or girlfriend, but a blast furnace . The song is about demise of the steel industry in Youngstown, Ohio, and Jeannette Furnace, nicknamed \"Sweet Jenny\", was a real blast furnace.\nJoisey : Where Bruce was born, raised, and has usually drawn a lot of his inspiration from. The loss of many industrial jobs in Springsteen's hometown of Freehold and in other parts of New Jersey informed a lot of his lyrics and beliefs right from the start of his career, and his singing about this issue obviously found a sympathetic audience in the parts of the state that were suffering from the loss of jobs. Scenery from the Jersey Shore (no, not that Jersey Shore ) are often used as imagery in his lyrics and song titles. And Bruce—loyal to his roots—always makes sure to have concerts in Jersey throughout his tours. It's no wonder that—although he's honored and adored by fans throughout America— it's in New Jersey where Bruce is the most beloved.\nAfter Bruce and Patti began having children, Bruce decided to move the family out of Beverly Hills to get away from that kind of environment. So where did he and Patti go to raise their kids? Back home to Jersey of course. To a town merely 15 minutes from Freehold, in fact.\nListen to any live recording of a Bruce song containing the word \"Jersey\"; you'll probably hear a large cheer from the audience as soon as they hear the word.\nKnight in Sour Armor : Some characters, e.g. in \"Highway Patrolman\".\nLarge Ham : \"The E Street Band has traveled thousands of miles, to fulfill their solemn vow...TO ROCK THE HOOOOOOOOUUSE!!!\"\nFrom his intro to their Super Bowl gig: \"Ladies and gentlemen! Tonight we are bringing the righteous and the mighty power of the E Street Band into YOUR beautiful home! So I want you to to step back from the guacamole dip! I want you to put the chicken fingers down! And turn your televisions ALL the way up!...\"\nJon Stewart , a life-long Springsteen fan, provided an Affectionate Parody the next day; \"You are about to witness the righteous power of the Daily Show! I want you to step away from your remote... wha, no? It was cool when Springsteen did it!\"\nOr this 2013 classic: \"I want you to go home with your back aching and your hands aching and your voice hoarse and your feet aching and your knees aching AND YOUR SEXUAL ORGANS STIMULATED!!!\"\n\"The heart-stopping, fun-loving, earth-quaking, love-making, record-breaking, air-conditioner-shaking, Viagra-taking, history-making E! STREET! BAND! \"\n\"What time is it?\" \"It's BOSS TIME!!!!!\"\nLegacy Character : Max Weinberg was replaced by his son on the most recent tour for some shows that conflicted with his commitments to The Tonight Show . Danny Federici's son also played on the most recent album following his death. After Clarence Clemons' death, his nephew Jake joined the band on sax.\nLive Album : In Concert: MTV Unplugged, Live in New York City, Hammersmith Odeon, London '75, Live in Dublin\nAnd the 13x platinum box set Live 1975-85.\nLoads and Loads of Characters : The current E Street Band has eight permanent members, along with two semi-permanent members, with a rotation for some of the permanent members. However, Wikipedia lists, over the entire lifetime of the band, twelve full-time members and a further seventeen touring members. And Bruce. Fortunately, Bruce always introduces everyone on stage each concert. The Sessions Band, active briefly in '97 and then again in '05-'06, had roughly twenty-five members (never all at once, but sometimes with twenty people on stage), only a couple of which were also E Streeters!\nAlso, all the different characters in the songs (various women named Mary, Spanish Johnny, Hazey Davey, Jimmy the Saint, Go-Cart Mozart, Early Pearly, Bad Scooter, Wild Billy, Sandy, Kitty, Rosalita, Wendy, etc. etc., and those are just the ones with names.)\nLocation Song : \"Nebraska\", \"Born In The U.S.A.\", which all paint a not so rosy-posy picture of the USA.\nThe Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle\nDarkness On the Edge of Town\nIt's Hard To Be A Saint In The City\nLyrical Dissonance : Probably the reason so many people misinterpret his songs:\n\"Born in the USA\" (although it depends on what version you're listening to; the versions on Tracks and Live In New York City are more obviously mournful and don't really fit this trope)\n\"Born to Run\"\n\"Hungry Heart\"\n\"Johnny 99\"\nLyrical Shoehorn : Bruce is prone to inserting the word \"mister\" into lines where he needs a couple of extra syllables to fill out the meter.\nThe Mafia : \"Atlantic City\" opens by referencing the assassination of Philadelphia crime family boss Philip \"the Chicken Man\" Testa\n, and it seems that the viewpoint character is about to join the Mafia as a hitman (either taking a job in AC or, more likely, spending his last free weekend on the Shore).\nMohs Scale of Lyrical Hardness : Since he's done everything from odes to old-fashioned Rock 'N' Roll, cars and love songs to serious political commentary, tales of working class struggle and the odd Murder Ballad , it's safe to say that he's gone all over it, from 2 to an 8 or even (arguably) a 9 in some cases.\nMohs Scale of Rock and Metal Hardness : All over the bottom half of the scale- his songs jump around between 1 and 5.\nMood Whiplash : The River (the album; the title track is an unrelenting downer). Completely intentional, according to Word of God .\nMorality Ballad : \"Born in the USA\".\nMany of Springsteen's songs could be described, to paraphrase Max Frisch, as morality ballads without a moral. His characters find themselves bewildered and torn by their actions, but it is clear they would do the same things again, for instance in \"Hungry Heart\".\n\"Nebraska\" - inspired by the real-life murder spree of Charles Starkweather.\n\"Johnny 99\"\n\"Highway 29\"\nArguably \"Atlantic City\"\nNever Bareheaded : Steve Van Zandt was in a car accident a long time ago; his head broke the windshield and the hair on the top of his head never grew back. Consequently, he is always seen with a bandana tied around his head, except when he starred in The Sopranos and wore a pompadour wig instead.\nOutlaw : \"Outlaw Pete\"\nOutlaw Couple : \"Nebraska\", \"Highway 29\" and \"Easy Money.\"\nPrecision F-Strike : Springsteen doesn't usually use R-rated language in his songs, he saves it for special occasions:\n\"Long Time Comin'\": \"Two kids in a sleeping bag beside / Reach 'neath your shirt, put my hands across your belly and feel / Another one kickin' inside / And I ain't gonna fuck it up this time!\"\n\"Queen of the Supermarket\": \"As I lift my groceries in to my car / I turn back for a moment and catch a smile / That blows this whole fucking place apart!\"\n\"My Best was Never Good Enough\": \"And the early bird catches the fuckin' worm...\"\nLive versions of \"Lost in the Flood\": \"Hey man, did you see that, those poor cats are sure fucked up\"\n\"Don't vote for that fuckin' Bush !\"- during a concert at the Nassau Coliseum on April 1, 1988.\nProtest Song : \"Born in the USA\" again, which is about the treatment of Vietnam veterans. Many other songs also qualify, and The Ghost of Tom Joad is almost an entire album of protest songs.\nSeveral of the songs on Wrecking Ball, particularly \"Shackled and Drawn\" and \"Death To My Hometown.\"\nRearrange the Song : Notably, \"Youngstown\" was reworked from a mournful acoustic ballad to furious rocker\ncapped by possibly the wildest guitar solo in Springsteen's entire catalogue.\nThe \"Live In Dublin\" album contains several classic Springsteen songs that have been rewritten to sound like folk songs (this was right after his folk album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions was released and he was on tour with the Sessions Band).\nRecycled Lyrics : Nebraska has some examples: \"Atlantic City\" and \"Johnny 99\" both have the narrator mention having \"debts no honest man can pay\". \"State Trooper\" and \"Open All Night\" share the couplet \"in the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy / radio relay towers lead me to my baby\". In \"State Trooper\", the \"radio's jammed up with talk show stations\", whereas in \"Open All Night\" it's \"jammed up with gospel stations\".\n\"Spanish Eyes\" and \"I'm On Fire\" both start with the lines \"Hey little girl is your Daddy home, did he go away and leave you all alone?\"\n\"Further On Up The Road\" and \"Maria's Bed\" both contain the lines, \"Got on my dead man's suit and smiling skull ring, lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing.\" There's also a line in both songs about being \"out in the desert, doing my time.\"\nRepurposed Pop Song : Barack Obama used \"The Rising\" in his campaign, and Springsteen himself played it at a few rallies.\nRonald Reagan rather famously tried to do this to \"Born in the USA\" apparently mistaking it for a (somewhat jingoistic) hyper patriotic anthem.

                "The Ghost Of Tom Joad - Bruce Springsteen - Listen to Free Music by Bruce Springsteen on Pandora Internet Radio\nmore\nBruce Springsteen\nIn the decades following his emergence on the national scene in 1975, Bruce Springsteen proved to be that rarity among popular musicians, an artist who maintained his status as a frontline recording and performing star, consistently selling millions of albums and selling out arenas and stadiums around the world year after year, as well as retaining widespread critical approbation with ecstatic reviews greeting those discs and shows. Although there were a few speed bumps along the way in Springsteen's career, the wonder of his nearly unbroken string of critical and commercial success is that he achieved it while periodically challenging his listeners by going off in unexpected directions, following his muse even when that meant altering the sound of his music or the composition of his backup band, or making his lyrical message overtly political. Of course, it may have been these very sidesteps that kept his image and his music fresh, especially since he always had the fallback of returning to what his fans thought he did best, barnstorming the country with a marathon rock & roll show using his longtime bandmates.\nBruce Springsteen was born September 23, 1949 in Freehold, New Jersey, the son of Douglas Springsteen, a bus driver, and Adele (Zirilli) Springsteen, a secretary. He became interested in music after seeing Elvis Presley perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956 and got a guitar, but he didn't start playing seriously until 1963. In 1965, he joined his first band, the Beatles -influenced Castiles. They got as far as playing in New York City, but broke up in 1967 around the time Springsteen graduated from high school and began frequenting clubs in Asbury Park, New Jersey. From there, he briefly joined Earth, a hard rock band in the style of Cream . Also in the hard rock vein was his next group, Child (soon renamed Steel Mill), which featured keyboard player Danny Federici and drummer Vini Lopez. (Later on, guitarist Steve Van Zandt joined on bass.) Steel Mill played in California in 1969, drawing a rave review in San Francisco and even a contract offer from a record label. But they broke up in 1971, and Springsteen formed a big band, the short-lived Dr. Zoom & the Cosmic Boom, quickly superseded by the Bruce Springsteen Band. Along with Federici, Lopez, and Van Zandt (who switched back to guitar), this group also included pianist David Sancious and bassist Garry Tallent, plus a horn section that didn't last long before being replaced by a single saxophonist, Clarence Clemons . Due to a lack of work, however, Springsteen broke up the band and began playing solo shows in New York City. It was as a solo performer that he acquired a manager, Mike Appel, who arranged an audition for legendary Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond. Hammond signed Springsteen to Columbia in 1972.\nIn preparing his debut LP, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., Springsteen immediately re-hired most of his backup band, Federici, Lopez, Sancious, Tallent, and Clemons . (Van Zandt, on tour with the Dovells , was mostly unavailable.) The album went unnoticed upon its initial release in January 1973 (although Manfred Mann's Earth Band would turn its lead-off track, \"Blinded by the Light,\" into a number one hit four years later, and the LP itself has since gone double platinum). The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle (September 1973) also failed to sell despite some rave reviews. (It too has gone double platinum.) The following year, Springsteen revised his backup group -- now dubbed the E Street Band -- as Lopez and Sancious left, and Max Weinberg (drums) and Roy Bittan (piano) joined, and in 1975, Van Zandt returned to the group. With this unit he toured extensively while working on the LP that represented his last chance with Columbia. By the time Born to Run (August 1975) was released, the critics and a significant cult audience were with him, and the title song became a Top 40 hit while the album reached the Top Ten, going on to sell six million copies.\nDespite this breakthrough, Springsteen's momentum was broken by a legal dispute, as he split from Appel and brought in Jon Landau (a rock critic who had famously called him the \"rock & roll future\" in a 1974 concert review) as his new manager. The legal issues took until 1977 to resolve, during which time Springsteen was unable to record. (One beneficiary of this problem was Patti Smith , to whom Springsteen gave the composition \"Because the Night,\" which, with some lyrical revisions by her, became her only Top 40 hit in the spring of 1978.) He finally returned in June 1978 with Darkness on the Edge of Town. By then, he had to rebuild his career. Record labels had recruited their own versions of the Springsteen \"heartland rock\" sound, in such similar artists as Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band (who actually preceded Springsteen but achieved national recognition in his wake), Johnny Cougar (aka John Mellencamp ), Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Meat Loaf , Eddie Money , and even fellow Jersey Shore residents Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes, to name only some of the more successful ones. At the same time, the punk/new wave trend had become the new focus of critical devotion, making Springsteen seem unfashionable. Notwithstanding these challenges, Darkness earned its share of good reviews and achieved Top Ten status, selling three million copies as the single \"Prove It All Night\" hit the Top 40. (In early 1979, the Pointer Sisters took Springsteen's composition \"Fire\" into the Top Ten.)\nSpringsteen fully consolidated his status with his next album, the two-LP set The River (October 1980), which hit number one, sold five million copies, and spawned the Top Ten hit \"Hungry Heart\" and the Top 40 hit \"Fade Away.\" (In 1981-1982, Gary U.S. Bonds reached the Top 40 with two Springsteen compositions, \"This Little Girl\" and \"Out of Work.\") But having finally topped the charts, Springsteen experimented on his next album, preferring the demo recordings of the songs he had made for Nebraska (September 1982) to full-band studio versions, especially given the dark subject matter of his lyrics. The stark LP nevertheless hit the Top Ten and sold a million copies without benefit of a hit single or a promotional tour. (Van Zandt amicably left the E Street Band for a solo career at this point and was replaced by Nils Lofgren .)\nBut then came Born in the U.S.A. (June 1984) and a two-year international tour. The album hit number one, threw off seven Top Ten hits (\"Dancing in the Dark,\" which earned Springsteen his first Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, \"Cover Me,\" \"Born in the U.S.A.,\" \"I'm on Fire,\" \"Glory Days,\" \"I'm Goin' Down,\" and \"My Hometown\"), and sold 15 million copies, putting Springsteen in the pop heavens with Michael Jackson and Prince . For his next album, he finally exploited his reputation as a live performer by releasing the five-LP/three-CD box set Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band Live/1975-85 (November 1986), which topped the charts, was certified platinum 13 times, and spawned a Top Ten hit in a cover of Edwin Starr 's \"War.\" (In March 1987, \"the Barbusters\" -- actually Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, took Springsteen's composition \"Light of Day,\" written for the movie of the same name, into the Top 40.)\nCharacteristically, Springsteen returned to studio work with a more introverted effort, Tunnel of Love (October 1987), which presaged his 1989 divorce from his first wife, actress Julianne Phillips. (He married a second time to singer/songwriter/guitarist Patti Scialfa , who had joined the E Street Band as a backup vocalist in 1984.) The album was another number one hit, selling three million copies and producing two Top Ten singles, \"Brilliant Disguise\" and the title song, as well as the Top 40 hit \"One Step Up.\" The album earned him a second male rock vocal Grammy. (In the spring of 1988, Natalie Cole covered the Springsteen B-side \"Pink Cadillac\" for a Top Ten hit.)\nSpringsteen retreated from public view in the late '80s, breaking up the E Street Band in November 1989. He returned to action in March 1992 with a new backup band, simultaneously releasing two albums, Human Touch and Lucky Town, which entered the charts at numbers two and three, respectively, each going platinum. A double-sided single combining \"Human Touch\" and \"Better Days\" was a Top 40 hit. Of course, this was a relative fall-off from the commercial heights of the mid-'80s, but Springsteen was undeterred. He next contributed the moody ballad \"Streets of Philadelphia\" to the soundtrack of Philadelphia, film director Jonathan Demme's 1993 depiction of a lawyer fighting an unjust termination for AIDS. The recording became a Top Ten hit, and the song went on to win Springsteen four Grammys (Song of the Year, Best Rock Song, best song written for a motion picture or television, and another for male rock vocal) and the Academy Award for best song.\nIn early 1995, Springsteen reconvened the E Street Band to record a few new tracks for his Greatest Hits (February 1995). The album topped the charts and sold four million copies, with one of the new songs, \"Secret Garden,\" eventually reaching the Top 40. Despite this success, Springsteen resisted the temptation to reunite with the E Street Band on an ongoing basis at this point, instead recording another low-key, downcast, near-acoustic effort in the style of Nebraska, The Ghost of Tom Joad (November 1995), and embarking on a solo tour to promote it. The LP won a Grammy for best contemporary folk album, but it missed the Top Ten and only went gold.\nA much more prolific songwriter and recording artist than what was reflected in his legitimately released discography, Springsteen went into his vault of unreleased material and assembled the four-CD box set Tracks (November 1998), which went platinum. Whether inspired by the playing he heard on those recordings, bowing to constant fan pressure, or simply recognizing the musicians with whom he had made his most successful music, Springsteen finally reunited the E Street Band in 1999, beginning with a performance at his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. All the members from the 1974-1989 edition of the group returned. (Characteristically, Springsteen sidestepped the question of whether to use Van Zandt or Lofgren in the guitar position by rehiring both of them.) They embarked on a world tour that lasted until mid-2000, its final dates resulting in the album Live in New York City, which hit the Top Ten and sold a million copies.\nSpringsteen's writing process in coming up with a new rock album to be recorded with members of the E Street Band was given greater impetus in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the resulting disc, The Rising (July 2002), contained songs that reflected on the tragedy. The album hit number one and sold two million copies, winning the Grammy for rock album, as the title song won for rock song and male rock vocal. Following another lengthy tour with the E Street Band, Springsteen again returned to the style and mood of Nebraska on another solo recording, Devils & Dust (April 2005), taking to the road alone to promote it. The album hit number one and went gold, winning a Grammy for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. One year later, Springsteen unveiled another new musical approach when he presented We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (April 2006), an album on which he played new arrangements of folk songs associated with Pete Seeger , played by a specially assembled Sessions Band. The album reached the Top Ten and went gold as Springsteen toured with the group. It also won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album. The tour led to a concert recording, Live in Dublin (June 2007), which reached the Top 40.\nOnce again, Springsteen recorded a new rock album, Magic (October 2007), as a precursor to re-forming the E Street Band and going out on another long tour. The album hit number one and went platinum, with the song \"Radio Nowhere\" earning Grammys for rock song and solo rock vocal. (Another track from the album, \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes,\" won the rock song Grammy the following year.) Sadly, longtime E Street Band keyboardist Danny Federici succumbed to a three-year battle with melanoma on April 17, 2008, his death causing the first irrevocable change in the group's personnel (saxophonist Clarence Clemons would die on June 18, 2011 due to complications from a stroke). Federici was replaced by Charles Giordano, who had played with Springsteen previously in the Sessions Band.\nSpringsteen finished the tour in 2008 and held several additional shows in support of Senator Barack Obama, whose presidential campaign had kicked into hyperdrive earlier that year. While playing an Obama rally in early November, Springsteen debuted material from his forthcoming album, Working on a Dream, whose tracks had been recorded with the E Street Band during breaks in the group's previous tour. The resulting album, which was the last to feature contributions from Federici (as well as his son, Jason), arrived on January 27, 2009, one week after Obama's historic inauguration. It immediately hit number one, Springsteen's ninth album to top the charts over a period of three decades, and it went on to go gold and win him another Grammy for solo rock vocal. In February, Springsteen and the E Street Band provided the half-time entertainment at Super Bowl XLIII. The group's tour, which featured full-length performances of some of Springsteen's classic albums at selected shows, ran through November 22, 2009. In December, the 60-year-old was ranked fourth among the top touring acts of the first decade of the 21st century, behind only the Rolling Stones , U2, and Madonna . The same month he was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors.\nSpringsteen's 2010 was devoted to a revival of Darkness on the Edge of Town, with the 1978 masterpiece receiving an expanded box set called The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town; the set contained a feature-length documentary and a double-disc set of outtakes that was also available separately. As Springsteen began work on a studio album produced by Ron Aniello, who'd previously worked with Patti Scialfa , Clarence Clemons died. Clemons ' last recorded solo appeared on \"Land of Hope and Dreams,\" one of many politically charged songs on the resulting album, Wrecking Ball. Supported by a major media blitz that included a showcase week of Bruce covers on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and the Boss delivering a keynote address at South by Southwest, Wrecking Ball appeared the first week of March 2012. Before the end of that month, he embarked on a mammoth world tour to promote the album, on which he eventually took in 26 countries over the course of 18 months.\nLate in 2013, it was announced that the E Street Band would receive a belated induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in early 2014. Prior to the induction ceremony came High Hopes, Springsteen's 18th studio album. Inspired in part by Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello , who had temporarily replaced Van Zandt for the last six months of the Wrecking Ball tour and also played on the album, High Hopes was a collection of covers, reinterpretations of old songs, and leftovers; it appeared in mid-January 2014 and easily reached number one on the album charts. He toured with the E Street Band through the late spring, and also issued the EP American Beauty, which consisted of four unreleased songs from the High Hopes sessions.\nIn late 2015, Springsteen released another audio/video box set offering an in-depth look at one of his classic albums. The Ties That Bind: The River Collection offered a remastered version of Springsteen's 1980 album, along with an expansive disc of outtakes, an early single-LP version of the album Springsteen pulled prior to release, an original documentary on the making of The River, and a complete concert filmed in Tempe, Arizona in 1980. In the fall of 2016, Springsteen released a memoir entitled Born to Run, which was accompanied by a career-spanning collection called Chapter & Verse that he compiled himself. ~ William Ruhlmann",
                "Overrated, Underrated, or Properly Rated: Bruce Springsteen «\nhttps://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:stevenhyden:playlist:1LmPKJBvDJBzLkDH0XofHD\nBorn to Run (1975) There’s a particular brand of vanity that exists in certain kinds of young men between the ages of 19 and 27 where it’s vitally important to present a façade that is equal parts masculine, feminine, tough, and sensitive. For instance (and this example is purely hypothetical and not at all autobiographical), this certain kind of young man may drive around alone late on rainy nights — he actually chooses to drive when it rains because it is appropriately evocative for his inner emotional geography — while listening to Clarence Clemons’s sax solo on “Jungleland.” And when he feels himself starting to cry, he will look in the rearview mirror in order to stare at his own tears. He knows he will never tell anyone that he cries alone to the sounds of the Big Man’s titanic blowing, but he guesses that strangers will sense it, and this will make him appear soulful. (Forgive him. He is a little naive and very silly.) It doesn’t matter that the lyrics of “Jungleland” have virtually nothing to do with his life — he’s pretty sure that the only people for whom “kids flash guitars just like switchblades” represents reality are Danny Zuko and Kenickie. But this song is still his avatar, and he’s confident it always will be.\nBecause this person is a nerd, he will remember that a 25-year-old Bruce Springsteen painstakingly directed Clemons in the studio during the recording of “Jungleland,” telling him when to go up, when to go down, and when to hold. And he will wonder whether Bruce did this while staring at himself in the mirror. PROPERLY RATED.\nDarkness on the Edge of Town (1978) This was the first Springsteen record coproduced by his new manager and ex–rock critic Jon Landau, and it sounds like a record designed by a rock critic. The songs are shorter (rock critics hate jamminess), more cynical (rock critics hate sentimentality), and generally weighed down by undercurrents of depression and severe daddy issues (no comment). So, I guess I’m outing myself as a sucker for critic-bait when I say this is my favorite Springsteen album. It’s his best “guitar solo” record (see “Adam Raised a Cain” or any live version of “Prove It All Night”). It’s also the first, best example of Springsteen juxtaposing rousing rock music with miniaturist, miserablist, Middle American storytelling — which is to say, it kicks your ass and crushes your heart. PROPERLY RATED.\nThe River (1980) This is a double album that feels like two separate albums. The first record takes place during the day — the people in these songs go to work and then drink off the drudgery at the corner tavern. The second record occurs in the middle of the night. (Not to be confused with The Night, the romanticized nocturnal fantasyland of the early records. This night is black, cold, and silent, like that final jump cut on the Sopranos finale .) I listen to the first disc at least three times as much, mostly because I love how it splits the difference between Born to Run and Darkness. This disc contains some of Springsteen’s most exuberant songs (“Two Hearts,” “Out in the Street”) as well as his most direct gut punches (“Independence Day,” the title track). Then you have the second disc, which is so ominous and death-obsessed it manages to out-Darkness Darkness. (This is the side that Sylvester Stallone plays endlessly in Cop Land, because the big lug feels like a stolen car being driven on a pitch-black night.)\nInitially greeted by critics as a masterwork and responsible for Springsteen’s first hit, “Hungry Heart,” The River was subsequently overshadowed by the records that surround it in his discography. Casual listeners will always pick up Born to Run or Nebraska first. But The River is the most representative of his entire body of work. UNDERRATED.\nNebraska (1982) I love Nebraska. I love that it contains my favorite Springsteen “hit.” 2 I love that it has at least three deep cuts (the title track, “Johnny 99,” and “Used Cars”) that belong in the 98th percentile of Bruce Springsteen deep cuts. I love that it easily has the best cover art of any Springsteen album. 3 I love that Bruce recorded it at home and on a four-track recorder, which makes Nebraska his Bee Thousand. I love that Kanye West likened Yeezus to Nebraska, because “Hold My Liquor” is essentially “Highway Patrolman” as sung from Frankie’s point of view. That said, we’re not here to figure out whether Nebraska is great, but whether it’s properly rated. This complicates the issue, because Nebraska is the go-to record for people who don’t like Springsteen because it’s not like Springsteen’s other albums.\nWhich is fine, except these same people then take the next step and declare Nebraska to be Springsteen’s “best” album, based on the (strange) criterion that an artist’s least characteristic work should somehow be considered superior to his most characteristic. I can’t allow this. (In my view, Born, Darkness, and The River are all better records.) Therefore, I must declare Nebraska to be ever so slightly OVERRATED.\nBorn in the U.S.A. (1984) It seems ridiculous to suggest that an album that sold 15 million copies in this country alone and spawned seven top-10 singles might be underrated, so I won’t. But if I were to make that case, I would merely point out that Born in the U.S.A. is hardly ever mentioned in the “Best Springsteen album” conversation, even though it has the stats and the songs (“Dancing in the Dark” and “I’m on Fire,” with “No Surrender” and “Downbound Train” coming off the bench) to put it there. A lot of this has to do with Born in the U.S.A.‘s unwitting status as a prop for demagogues. Dumb people who identify as conservative rewarded this album in the ’80s for extolling the virtues of Reagan’s America (when in fact it does the opposite). In retrospect, dumb people who identify as liberal have penalized this album for being jingoistic (when in fact it is the opposite). But, again, a record this popular can’t be credibly classified as underrated, so let’s just say the massive sales and widespread misinterpretation cancel each other out. PROPERLY RATED.\nTunnel of Love (1987) Based on my personal experience, this is by far his most underrated record. (I still encounter Springsteen fans who dismiss Tunnel of Love as an unfortunate byproduct of Bruce’s “expensive synths and cheap bolo ties” period.) Lyrically, this is his best album, even better than Nebraska. You really shouldn’t be allowed to hear this record until you’ve been married for a few years, though at that point it might strike a little too close to home. If Ingmar Bergman had been born in Freehold and cut his artistic teeth at the Stone Pony, he would’ve made this record in place of Scenes From a Marriage. Totally ’80s production aside — though, really, Tunnel of Love basically sounds as modern as that Haim record — this album represents the heaviest blues of Springsteen’s career. The songs are about men and women who flirt, have sex, fall in love, get married, get bored, have sex with other people, and wind up stuck in the middle of that dark night from the second disc of The River. Shout-out to Patti Scialfa, the woman for whom Bruce left his wife Julianne Phillips, who provides incredible backing vocals and a fitting subtext to the tortured cheater ode “One Step Up.” UNDERRATED.\nHuman Touch (1992) Bruce ditches Jersey and the E Street Band for L.A. and a new backing group that includes future American Idol judge Randy Jackson, the guitarist from Lone Justice, and the drummer from the “Love Shack” video. Oh, and the ’80s are over and misanthropic heroin addicts have turned rock away from “Born to Run” and toward “Destined for Piss-Stained Couches.” Yep, the ’90s were a bad time for Bruce, and it doesn’t get any worse in his catalogue than Human Touch. The only rock album possibly more out of step with the times in ’92 was Def Leppard’s Adrenalize, but at least Joe Elliott contained his irrelevance to just one record. Good news first: The holler-through-the-murk shimmer of “Gloria’s Eyes” is a diamond in the rough. It belongs on any post–glory years “unsung” Bruce playlist. The rest of Human Touch deserves its reputation as thoroughly spoiled macho man-meat. 4 PROPERLY RATED.\nLucky Town (1992) Half of these songs are as corny as anything on Human Touch. (“Leap of Faith” and “Local Hero” sound like Bruce trying to write Eddie and the Cruisers songs.) The other half (especially the title track, “If I Should Fall Behind,” and “Beautiful Reward”) isn’t on par with his ’70s and ’80s material, but (by default) it’s his strongest output of the decade. This shouldn’t be seen as an endorsement, exactly, but given its terrible reputation, I’d say Lucky Town is a touch UNDERRATED.\nThe Ghost of Tom Joad (1995) I’ve never listened to this the whole way through. And neither have you. Good thing the title track comes first. PROPERLY RATED.\nThe Rising (2002) This was the record that the country needed Bruce Springsteen to make after September 11. His performance of “My City of Ruins” — actually written one year before the terrorist attack — during the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit had all of the gravitas and resolve that people expected from the Boss at such a tragic time. As hokey as Springsteen’s detractors find his inspirational heartland spokesman shtick, it’s undeniable that millions of people find solace in songs like “My City of Ruins” that are consciously conceived as bulwarks against the existential void precisely when that void appears to be closing in.\nSo, I don’t want to underestimate the importance this record had for people when it was released. It’s just that, for me, The Rising signifies my least-favorite version of Springsteen — the one where he’s in message-driven stump speech mode. This is a record about Big Themes being thrust upon little people, as opposed to records like Nebraska and Born in the U.S.A., which explored the lives of little people in order to illuminate the Big Themes lurking in the background. 5 OVERRATED.\nDevils & Dust (2004) At first I thought this was like Nebraska but worse, but over time I’ve come around. Now it’s like The Ghost of Tom Joad except likable. UNDERRATED.\nWe Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (2006) Not essential by any means, but it’s the best “band” record he’s ever made outside of E Street. And “O Mary Don’t You Weep” is one of my two or three favorite non-Magic Springsteen tracks of the ’00s. A fine tribute to Pete Seeger, and an excellent homage to Tom Waits. UNDERRATED.\nMagic (2007) At first I resisted the obvious classicism of Magic — surely I couldn’t allow myself, as a devotee of Darkness on the Edge of Town and The River, to blindly love deliberate throwbacks like “You’ll Be Comin’ Down” and “Gypsy Biker” without checking myself. Then I thought, Stop being a moron. And so I did. I’m not privy to the private creative conversations that went on during the making of Magic, but somebody must’ve persuaded Springsteen to get back to making enjoyable rock records that sound good when played loudly in bars. This idea (apparently) hadn’t occurred to Bruce since Born in the U.S.A., but Magic showed he was still really good at making that kind of record. PROPERLY RATED.\nWorking on a Dream (2009) Neil Young makes albums like this all the time, on which the songs are half-baked but are thrown together in the hopes that they will somehow cohere into a weirdly harmonious mess. Springsteen is typically more cautious than Young, so a record like Working on a Dream seems worse than it is. It actually reminds me a lot of High Hopes — I don’t really like it, but I appreciate that Springsteen was able to say, “Fuck it, I’m gonna go ahead and release ‘Outlaw Pete’ even if it sounds like Kiss.” PROPERLY RATED.\nWrecking Ball (2012) I feel like I personally overrated Wrecking Ball when it first came out. I listened to it intensely for a few days, wrote a really positive review , and I don’t think I’ve played it all the way through since. Most of the tracks sound like rejected theme songs for a preachy David Simon TV drama. The title track is still great, though. OVERRATED.\nLive Albums\nBetween albums, boxed sets, EPs, and DVDs, there are 10 of them. (Which is just a fraction of the live bootlegs that are easily accessible online.) Out of all those, I’d recommend just one, Hammersmith Odeon London ’75, to the casual fan. 6 This is not a great average. OVERRATED.\nB Sides, Non-Album Tracks, and Outtakes\nOnly Bob Dylan and Neil Young rival Springsteen’s “shadow” discography of unreleased (or “under”-released) material. Springsteen’s songwriting output, especially in the late ’70s and early ’80s, was legendarily prodigious — he was famous for writing three or four songs for every one that ended up on a record. A lot of this unreleased material was eventually released, and a good chunk of it is brilliant. Discs 2 and 3 of the Tracks boxed set rank with the best albums of his career. Then there’s The Promise, the double record released in 2010 that was made at the same time as Darkness. For Springsteen fanatics, comparing favorite outtakes is the foremost game of one-upmanship. Here, I’ll start with “Iceman.” What do you got? PROPERLY RATED.\nThe Live Concert Experience\nThis is the most mythologized aspect of Bruce Springsteen’s career. Springsteen isn’t described merely as a great live performer — his concerts are classified as RELIGIOUS experiences conjuring SPIRITS that will CHANGE YOUR LIFE. Forget the hyperbole. I can only address this based on my firsthand experience.\nI’ve seen Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band four times. The first was at Target Center in Minneapolis in 1999. I was 21 and it was just OK. The second time was at Bradley Center in Milwaukee on St. Patrick’s Day in 2008. I loved it. The third time was also at Bradley Center in 2009. He played the entirety of Born to Run and brought out Richard Davis 7 to play on “Meeting Across the River.” It was amazing. The fourth time was in 2012 at Wrigley Field. My seats sucked, the sound sucked, the Old Style Light could’ve been a touch colder, and I still had a wonderful time. PROPERLY RATED.\nThe E Street Band\nClarence Clemons: R.I.P. The Big Man was like an athlete whose worth isn’t measured by statistics. While it’s true that saxophone doesn’t appear in the majority of Springsteen songs, Clemons was unquestionably the heart of the band. PROPERLY RATED.\nGarry Tallent: Unless you’re Paul McCartney or Geddy Lee, the bass player is always underrated, particularly if you’re in a band that happens to rock. UNDERRATED.\nDanny Federici: R.I.P. He looked the most like a guy who was selected randomly from an anonymous New Jersey bar band. But he didn’t play like it. UNDERRATED.\nVini “Mad Dog” Lopez: The original drummer. He got fired after he accused Springsteen’s manager of stealing from the band. A few years later, Springsteen himself sued his manager. Rock rule no. 1: The drummer always takes the hit, even when he’s right. UNDERRATED.\nDavid Sancious: The original pianist. He played on the first two records and then came back for Human Touch. One of the best musicians to ever spend time in the E Street Band, his playing on “Incident on 57th Street” is exquisite. UNDERRATED. 8\nErnest “Boom” Carter: The drummer who briefly replaced Lopez and was subsequently replaced by Max Weinberg. If he hadn’t played drums on “Born to Run,” nobody would remember him. But he did, so he’s immortal. UNDERRATED.\nRoy Bittan: The most important member of the E Street Band in terms of Springsteen’s signature sound, even if he looks like a driver’s ed instructor from Hackensack. UNDERRATED.\nMax Weinberg: If Bittan defines the sound of the E Street Band, Weinberg personifies the band’s personality. He looks a little square, but he packs a wallop. PROPERLY RATED.\nSuki Lahav: She played violin for a year in the mid-’70s. I’ll be honest: I never heard of her until five minutes before typing this sentence. UNDERRATED.\nSteven Van Zandt: The official consigliere of New Jersey icons, Miami Steve stood at the right hand of Boss Springsteen and Boss Soprano. If those guys can overlook Van Zandt’s pirate-dressing tendencies, so can the rest of us. PROPERLY RATED.\nNils Lofgren: Before he joined the E Street Band, Lofgren was one of those whiz-kid prodigies who wound up playing guitar on Neil Young’s After the Gold Rush when he was 17. The fact that being a member of Crazy Horse at that age didn’t kill him is impressive enough, but he’s also had a long and respected solo career outside of the E Street Band. UNDERRATED.\nPatti Scialfa: The rare instance of the rock-star wife who was already in the band when she married the lead singer (and therefore didn’t have to be forcibly inserted à la Linda McCartney). PROPERLY RATED.\nSoozie Tyrell: She plays violin and contributes backing vocals. She seems nice. PROPERLY RATED.\nJake Clemons: The Big Man’s nephew. You could be cynical and argue that his hiring was nepotism and be absolutely correct. But the E Street Band is maybe the only institution I allow myself to get sentimental about anymore, and I’m glad there’s somebody named Clemons who’s still in the lineup. PROPERLY RATED.\nMusic Videos\nWhen it comes to Bruce Springsteen’s music videos, we only really have to talk about three of them, since they’re the only ones anybody remembers–slash–makes fun of.\n“Dancing in the Dark”\nOne of my favorite filmmakers of all time, Brian De Palma, directed this, which is why I refuse to take it at face value. Yes, if you ignore the subtext, the “Dancing in the Dark” video is the single cheesiest shooting star in the Springsteen galaxy. But let’s dig a little deeper: The lyrics for “Dancing in the Dark” are pretty clearly about a guy who hates himself. He wants to change his hair, his clothes, and his face. He wants to be a great man, though he can’t express this without exposing his lack of imagination. (He thinks a self-evident statement like “you can’t start a fire without a spark” is insightful, for example.) But in the video, Springsteen is smiling like an insane extra in Reefer Madness. He is so broad that it seems disingenuous, particularly given the song he’s performing. It’s such an over-the-top representation of Springsteen that it almost seems like a purposeful choice to be fake.\nThe same year that this video was released, De Palma made Body Double, which is about an unbelievably dorky actor (played by unbelievably dorky actor Craig Wasson) who is set up to witness the murder of a woman who is not the person she appears to be. Thematically, “doubles” appear throughout De Palma’s filmography; 9 it’s among the cinematic obsessions he picked up from Alfred Hitchcock. Do you see where I’m going with this? The buffed, smiling, frightfully Caucasian robo-dancing version of Springsteen in the “Dancing in the Dark” video is in fact a Springsteen “double” that subtly critiques how cartoonish Springsteen’s image became during the Born in the U.S.A. album cycle. It’s supposed to be cheesy, in other words.\nDo I actually believe this? Not completely. But it makes the video much more bearable. UNDERRATED.\n“I’m on Fire”\nI thought this one was directed by De Palma, too, because it’s sexy and prominently features a mysterious woman who probably just got done gratuitously masturbating in the shower. 10 But it was actually directed by John Sayles, whose big film from ’84, The Brother From Another Planet, shares no subtext with this video. This is just as well, because this video is good enough to stand on its own. PROPERLY RATED.\n“Glory Days”\nTwo thoughts: (1) The E Street Band was so versatile, it boasted both a tambourine player and a cowbell player simultaneously; and (2) all due respect to Andy Serkis, but mid-’80s Steven Van Zandt would’ve murdered the role of Gollum without CGI. PROPERLY RATED.\nSpringsteen’s Buick-Size Chin in the “We Are the World” Video\nImpressionists booked countless gigs at countless Chuckle Huts across the nation in the mid-’80s by jutting out their chins to simian-like proportions, gurgling a Michael Jackson–penned chorus about starving African children, and calling it Bruce Springsteen. This is the moment when the Boss briefly morphed into Rocky — he was the do-ragged and denim-clad manifestation of earnest American kick-assitude. In the “We Are the World” video, you can see him swallowing the world’s problems and running them forcibly through his lower colon. He implored viewers to join the fight — not by pointing an accusatory finger but rather by persuasively directing his earnest jawline. Alas, world hunger was not solved in the process, so I must say OVERRATED.\n“Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town”\nI have a friend who hates Springsteen as much as I love Springsteen, and he insists that the moment near the end of “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town” when Bruce stifles a laugh ranks among the most irritating two or three seconds in Christmas rock history. On this one Boss-related point, we agree. OVERRATED.\nJoan Jett and Michael J. Fox Performing “Light of Day” in Light of Day\nWith the possible exception of “Fire,” this is the best Springsteen song not initially performed by Springsteen. Because even the Boss defers to Marty McFly. 11 The moment when Joan Jett suddenly appears onstage is rivaled only by David St. Hubbins suddenly waving Nigel Tufnel to his side at the end of This Is Spinal Tap in the annals of great fake rock band moments. UNDERRATED.\n“Streets of Philadelphia”\nThis song has been mostly forgotten in Springsteen lore, but it was a top 10 hit during a fallow period in his career and won an Oscar for best original song, so “Streets of Philadelphia” is actually kind of important. “Streets” conforms to the cliché about aging rock stars in the ’90s getting “sonically adventurous” by employing lightly funky drum machines. It shouldn’t work, but this is a good tune. It’s a “message” song, but it’s not Bruce in dreaded stump speech mode. Rather, it’s a quiet character study about the time that Tom Hanks had AIDS. UNDERRATED.\nMTV Plugged Special\nThis is Bruce playing songs from two of his worst albums with musicians who aren’t in the E Street Band, and yet it’s somehow really good. The Human Touch/Lucky Town material sounds 100 percent better live than it does on the records. And Springsteen approaches Darkness-level greatness with his guitar playing. When this aired in 1992, I remember watching with a group of friends who thought Springsteen was the biggest tool in the world. And I had to sit there and silently love it. The silence ends now. UNDERRATED.\nHis Appearance in High Fidelity\nIt can’t really be overstated how unfashionable Springsteen had become by the end of the ’90s. Two developments helped to turn the tide: (1) his reunion with the E Street Band, and (2) his cameo in High Fidelity. It’s not so much that these events made it “acceptable” to like Springsteen so much as they reminded the public why he was awesome in the first place. Also: As a person who occasionally dreams about Springsteen at the precise moments when he needs counsel from the wise father figure he’s missing in his waking life, I can testify to the accuracy of this scene. UNDERRATED.\nHis Slide During “Tenth Avenue Freezeout” at the 2009 Super Bowl Halftime Show\nBy this time, Springsteen had successfully reasserted himself as a national treasure. He’s like a member of the family now — specifically, the uncle who drinks too much at the Super Bowl party and winds up recklessly hurtling himself across the floor. PROPERLY RATED.\nHis Performance of “Whip My Hair” As Born to Run–era Springsteen With Jimmy Fallon As Neil Young\nMany people under the age of 30 know Bruce Springsteen mainly for his impersonation of ’70s Bruce Springsteen on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon. Bruce is a little stiff, and not nearly as good at imitating himself as Fallon is at doing Young. But this is still pretty amazing, as is the encore of “Sexy and I Know It.” Given the trajectory of most rock stars, engaging in intentional self-parody isn’t a bad place to end up. PROPERLY RATED.\nComically mangling the lyrics to “Blinded by the Light” is the most overrated Springsteen joke in the history of Springsteen jokes. But when Bruce does it himself — go to 9:30 — it’s awesome.\nThat would be “Atlantic City,” which wasn’t really a hit though it was included on Springsteen’s mid-’90s greatest hits album.\nBruce Springsteen album covers from worst to first (studio records only): 18.

Purchase your cheap Bruce Springsteen tickets today and see this rock legend perform live in 2016!\nBruce Springsteen Biography\nBruce Springsteen was born on September 23, 1949, in Long Branch, New Jersey. At the age of 13, Bruce Springsteen bought himself a used guitar after being inspired by a television special featuring Elvis Presley. Soon after learning how to play the guitar, Bruce Springsteen began playing piano and harmonica and eventually began performing at local clubs and bars.\nIn 1972, Bruce Springsteen signed a record contract with Columbia Records and released his first album the following year. Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. (1973) and his second album, The Wild, the Innocent, & the E Street Shuffle (1973), were released to critical acclaim but without much commercial success. In 1974, Bruce Springsteen finalized the structure of the E Street Band. Membership has changed over time, but currently includes Garry Tallent on bass guitar and tuba, Max Weinberg on drums, Roy Bittan on piano and synthesizer, Steve Van Zandt on lead guitar, Nils Lofgren on pedal steel guitar, and Patti Scialfa on backing and duet vocals and acoustic guitar.  It wasn't until the release of Born to Run (1975) that Bruce Springsteen was sent into superstardom as a singer and songwriter. By this stage in his career, everyone was looking to buy Bruce Springsteen tickets. Critics were wild with Brucemania, and one of them even left his job to become Bruce Springsteen's manager, according to All Music Guide .\nBruce Springsteen is perhaps best known for his 1984 album, Born in the U.S.A.. The album saw seven hit singles released — including \"Dancing in the Dark,\" \"Cover Me,\" \"Born in the U.S.A.,\" \"I'm on Fire,\" \"Glory Days,\" \"I'm Goin' Down,\" and \"My Hometown\" — and sold over ten million copies. At that time, the album was the best-selling album in the history of Columbia Records, and the single \"Dancing in the Dark\" won a 1984 Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. The song was so popular upon release that former President Ronald Reagan used it during his re-election campaign. Today, with a 15x platinum rating, it remains Bruce Springsteen's best-selling album.\nThroughout the course of his career, Bruce Springsteen has received plenty of critical acclaim and awards. He has racked up 18 Grammy Awards as well as an Academy Award in 1994. The Academy Award was given to Bruce Springsteen for his song \"Streets of Philadelphia,\" which was written for the soundtrack to the film Philadelphia (1993). After winning the Academy Award for Best Song, the album went on to win multiple Grammys the following year. Springsteen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 and since then hasn't stopped writing conscientiously charged albums. The same year, Bruce Springsteen reformed the E Street Band, and they went on the Reunion Tour, including a three-night ending spectacular at Shea Stadium. Bruce Springsteen released The Rising in 2002, which reflects in part on the aftermath of the September 11th attacks in New York . He has also released the albums Devils and Dust (2005), We Shall Overcome (2007), Magic (2007), Working on a Dream (2009), Wrecking Ball (2012) and High Hopes (2014).",

He is best known for his work with the E Street Band. Nicknamed \"The Boss\", Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock, poetic lyrics, Americana sentiments centered on his native New Jersey and his lengthy and energetic stage performances, with concerts from the 1970s to the present decade running up to an uninterrupted 250 minutes in length.\nSpringsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented works. His most successful studio albums, Born in the U.S.A. and Born to Run, showcase a talent for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily American life; he has sold more than 65 million albums in the United States and more than 120 million worldwide and he has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award as well as being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him as the 23rd Greatest Artist of all time, the 96th Greatest Guitarist of all time on their latest list and the 36th Greatest Singer of all time in 2008.\nBruce Springsteen has been a member of, or has been backed by, several bands during his career, most notably The E Street Band.\nPrior to signing his first record deal in 1972, Springsteen was a member of several bands including Steel Mill. In October 1972 he formed a new band for the recording of his debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., which became known as The E Street Band, although the name was not officially introduced until September 1974. The E Street Band performed on all of Springsteen's recorded works from his debut until 1982's Nebraska, a solo album on which Springsteen himself played all the instruments.The full band returned for the next album Born in the USA, but there then followed a period from 1988 to 1999 in which albums were recorded with session musicians. The E Street Band were briefly reunited in 1995 for new contributions to the Greatest Hits compilation, and on a more permanent basis from 1999, since which time they have recorded three albums together (The Rising, Magic, and Working on a Dream) and performed a number of high profile tours.\nThe 2005 album Devils & Dust was largely a solo recording, with some contribution from session musicians and the 2006 folk rock We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions album was recorded and toured with another band, known as The Sessions Band.\nEarlier Bands: The Castiles, Earth, Child, Steel Mill, Sundance Blues Band, Dr Zoom and the Sonic Boom, Bruce Springsteen Band.\n*Discography*\nGreetings from Asbury Park, N.J.

The young Soares studied at the University of Lisbon and at the Faculty of Law, Sorbonne, Paris, becoming a student activist and thereafter taking up a law practice defending political dissidents. By the time that the army-imposed right-wing dictatorship fell in 1974, Soares had been jailed 12 times and twice experienced exile, in São Tomé (1968) and Paris (1970–74). In 1964 he and others founded a clandestine society, the Portuguese Socialist Action, which by 1974 had transformed into the Portuguese Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Portuguesa).\nFrom 1974 to 1975 Soares was foreign minister in the new but still military-controlled government and oversaw the negotiations for freeing Portugal’s overseas colonies. In 1976 he became the first constitutionally elected prime minister since the 1974 revolution (serving 1976, 1976–78, and 1983–85) and in 1986 became the first civilian head of state (president) since 1926, ending 60 years of army overlordship. Reelected in 1991, Soares was constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term, and he left office in 1996. He ran again for president in 2006 but finished third.\nSoares wrote a number of books on philosophy and politics, including a partly autobiographical work, first published in Paris, Le Portugal baillonné: un témoignage (1972; “Portugal Muzzled: A Testament”).

In 1976 he became the first constitutionally elected prime minister since the 1974 revolution (serving 1976, 1976–78, and 1983–85) and in 1986 became the first civilian head of state ( president ) since 1926, ending 60 years of army overlordship. Reelected in 1991, Soares was constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term, and he left office in 1996. He ran again for president in 2006 but finished third.\n      Soares wrote a number of books on philosophy and politics, including a partly autobiographical work, first published in Paris, Le Portugal baillonné: un témoignage (1972; “Portugal Muzzled: A Testament”). He also authored Portugal 's Struggle for Liberty (1975).\n* * *",

                "Mario Soares - Politics biography\nMario Soares\nCategory : Politics\nLast modified : 2011-10-19\nMário Soares was the first socialist president of Portugal and a long-time opponent of the right-wing Salazar regime.\nMário Alberto Nobre Lopes Soares was born in Lisbon on December 7, 1924. As a young boy he was greatly influenced by his father, a militant republican who spent considerable time in prison, in exile, or in hiding for his political activism. In the mid-1930s Soares' father started a private school, the Colegio Moderno, that reflected his deep-seted republican and liberal views. The young Soares subsequently lived and attended classes at this well-known private high school in Portugal. Later, Mário Soares attended the Classical University of Lisbon, where he became a student leader opposed to the right-wing authoritarian government of the day. In time he earned degrees in history, philosophy, and law, which, along with the influence of his father, prepared him well for his future role as one of Portugal's leading political activists.\nFor most of his adult life Mário Soares was an opponent of the fascist government of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar (1932-1968), which had come to power after a military government overthrow of the Portuguese Republic in 1926. Both Salazar's so-called \"New State\" and the six-year successor regime of Marcello Caetano (1968-1974) drew the opposition of Mário Soares. By the time the dictatorship fell in 1974 Soares had been jailed 12 times on political grounds, banished for almost one year to the former Portuguese territory of Sao Tome, and exiled for four years to France (1970-1974). Soares, however, was implacable. As one of his close friends stated: \"Nothing gets him down. He is an optimist. He is a fighter….\" One noteworthy act of defiance performed by Soares was his prison wedding to Maria Barroso, an actress he had met at the university. She later headed the Colegio Moderno founded by Soares' father.\nSoares' political fortunes rose with the emergence of the Portuguese Socialist Party (PSP). First founded in 1875, it was strongly suppressed with the rise of Salazar's dictatorship. However, in 1964 Soares and his allies played a leading role in founding the Portuguese Socialist Action, which led to the clandestine reconstruction of the PSP in the early 1970s. In 1969 Soares represented Portugal at the 11th congress of the Socialist International in Eastbourne. Following this congress he came to know many of the leading European socialists in the late 1960s and early 1970s; among them were Olaf Palme of Sweden, Willy Brandt of West Germany, and Bruno Kreisky of Austria. During his long exile in France he also became a close acquaintance of Francois Mitterrand.\nDue in part to the protracted rebellion in Portugal's African colonies (Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea) and the general state of the economy, young military officers overthrew the Caetano regime on April 25, 1974. Known as the Armed Forces Movement, the new leadership chose General Antonio de Spinola as the head of a new government that pledged to restore democracy to Portugal. When Soares returned to his country from Paris, he was quickly mobbed by thousands of his admirers. In the first military-controlled government following the overthrow Soares served as foreign minister and oversaw the granting of independence to the African colonies. In elections to a constituent assembly in April of 1975 Soares' PSP emerged as Portugal's strongest party, winning 116 seats out of 250.\nThe year 1975 proved to be a crucial year for the \"Portuguese Revolution\" and the political career of Mário Soares. Following the radicalization of the Armed Forces Movement, influenced by the Moscow line of the Communist Party of Portugal, Soares was compelled to resign as foreign minister, and in July he quit the government altogether and called for rallies and demonstrations against the Communists. Increased Communist influence in the government as well as an unsuccessful coup attempt by Spinola eventually motivated a moderate military faction in the Armed Forces Movement backed by Soares to call for elections in 1976. Soares' PSP won these elections with approximately 35 percent of the vote, winning 107 of the 263 seats in a new assembly. Soares then became Portugal's first constitutionally elected prime minister since the revolution of 1974 and served in this office from 1976 to 1978. In 1976, too, Soares was elected vice-president of the Socialist International.\nSoares' popularity and that of his party, however, declined in the following years due to austerity measures that the government imposed in order to obtain a loan from the International Monetary Fund. The representation of Soares' PSP in parliament dropped to 74 seats in the 1979 elections and to 66 seats in the 1980 elections. Defections from the PSP and the party's declining political fortunes at the polls influenced Soares to resign as secretary general of the Socialist Party in 1979. One year later, however, he resumed his duties as leader of the PSP.\nBy 1983 the popularity of the PSP was on the rise once again. Soares' effective opposition politics may be partially credited for this renewal. In the April 1983 elections the PSP won 36 percent of the vote and 101 seats in parliament; it subsequently formed a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party. Following the 1983 elections Soares was appointed to his former position as prime minister. However, in the October 1985 elections he and his party suffered a humiliating defeat, winning only 20 percent of the vote.\nNevertheless, Soares decided to run in the 1986 presidential elections, and four months later defeated the conservative candidate Diogo Freitas do Amaral by 151,000 votes. Soares thus became Portugal's first civilian president in 60 years. His tenacity and superior debating skills contributed to this victory. At the end of Soares' five-year term in 1991, his popularity was such that he was faced with only token opposition, and was easily re-elected, taking 70% of the popular vote. In 1996, socialist candidate Jorge Sampaio was elected to succeed Soares, who had to give up the presidency after two consecutive terms.\nSoares played a primary role in engineering the entry of Portugal into the European Economic Community (1986). His goal was to modernize Portugal's economy, the most backward in Western Europe, and to tie his nation closer to Western states. Portugal's integration into the economy of Western Europe strengthened the economy of Soares' country and stabilized the Portuguese political system. At home, Soares instituted popular informal town meetings with the citizens, and he rarely interefered with the work of the cabinet or legislature.\nPerhaps the most distinguished characteristic of Mário Soares as a politician was his ability to rebound after a loss. \"There are victories and defeats in politics,\" he was quoted as saying after his 1986 presidential victory, \"and what is necessary is to maintain your convictions, to keep battling.\"\nView the full website biography of Mario Soares .",

But as he said earlier, ''There are victories and defeats in politics, and what is necessary is to maintain your convictions, to keep battling.''\nMr. Soares is known to Portuguese as ''sempre em pe,'' the Portuguese name for the toy that bounces back whenever it is knocked over. It is a reflection of a tenacity, courage and ebullient optimism that have made Mr. Soares the central figure in Portuguese politics since the revolution in 1974 ended nearly 50 years of right-wing dictatorship.\nHe has been Prime Minister three times. Now he is President, a post that has less immediate power but one that he has long coveted because of its subtle, more long-term influence as a revered symbol of the nation, a sort of elected constitutional monarch.\n''I am a natural President,'' he said recently in his unabashed style. ''I have the experience to know how to avoid the successive crises the country has suffered.'' Father Was Often Exiled\nMario Alberto Nobre Lopes Soares was born in Lisbon on Dec. 7, 1924. His father, Joao Lopes Soares, was a liberal republican jailed and often exiled for protests against the monarchy and then the dictatorship of Antonio Oliveira Salazar.\nMr. Soares inherited his father's activism. He was a student leader at the Classical University of Lisbon against Salazar. After repeated interruptions in his studies, he earned degrees in philosophy and history and in law, and he set up a practice defending political dissidents.\nBy the time the dictatorship fell in 1974, by then under a new dictator, Marcello Caetano, Mr. Soares had been jailed 12 times, banished for seven months to the former Portuguese territory of Sao Tome and Principe and exiled in Italy and France for four years. A fellow inmate said that even in prison Mr. Soares ''was always in a splendid mood and made us laugh.''\nIn 1949, during one of his prison terms, he married Maria Barroso, an actress whom he had met at the university. The prison wedding was a show of defiance that led to Mrs. Soares's being banned from acting by the Government.\nToday, she heads a noted private high school founded by Mr. Soares's father, and she has just completed acting a role in a Portuguese movie. The couple have two children, a son who is a lawyer and a daughter who is a journalist. Helped Found Socialist Party\nIt was while in exile in 1974 that Mr. Soares and a group of friends founded the Socialist Party. When Mr. Soares arrived by train from Paris after the the army-led revolutuion in 1974, he was mobbed by thousands of waiting admirers and marched through the capital's streets.\nMr. Soares was Foreign Minister in the first military-controlled Government and oversaw the granting of independence to Portugal's African colonies. But the radicalization of the Government under the influence of the Moscow-line Communist Party of Portugal led him to quit the Government in July 1975 and set up a dramatic confrontation with anti-Government rallies and denunciations of the Communists.\nA moderate military faction backed by Mr. Soares headed off a Communist-backed coup attempt and in 1976 called elections, which Mr. Soares won, making him the first constitutionally elected Prime Minister after the revolution. He served as head of two Governments until 1979, and then of a third from 1983 to 1985.\nMr. Soares was the leading force behind Portugal's entry into the European Economic Community this year. But although he has a vision for a modern Portugal, he maintains an older political style of debating ideology and delivering fluorishing speeches.\nThat style was was challenged by the slick, youth-oriented campaign of Diogo Freitas do Amaral, a conservative Christian Democrat. Relies on Quick Thinking\nMr. Soares, with his energy and debating skills, prevailed. But even his supporters say, as his former professors said, that he relies heavily on his quick thinking and oratory skills, often to the detriment of dealing with practical details. They said being President would now allow him to focus on big ideas, which is what he has said he likes most.\nMr. Soares enjoys reading and music and has written memoirs and a political book. He acknowledges a fondness for the good life - he has a mountain house, a beach house and a Lisbon apartment. He said today that he would not move into the sumptuous presidential palace.\nBut he admits that what he is, more than anything, is a political animal.\n''I am here to unify the Portuguese and not divide them!'' he shouted from the balcony early this morning.\nphoto of Mario Soares",
                "SOCIALIST, IN BIG COMEBACK, WINS PORTUGAL'S PRESIDENCY - NYTimes.com\nSOCIALIST, IN BIG COMEBACK, WINS PORTUGAL'S PRESIDENCY\nBy EDWARD SCHUMACHER, Special to the New York Times\nPublished: February 17, 1986\nLISBON, Feb. 16— Former Socialist Prime Minister Mario Soares was elected Portugal's first civilian President in 60 years today.\nAccording to virtually complete returns, Mr. Soares won 51 percent of the vote. His opponent, Diogo Freitas do Amaral, a Christian Democrat, won 49 percent.\nIt was a remarkable comeback for Mr. Soares, a three-time former Prime Minister who was overwhelmingly voted out of Government just four months ago after being blamed for the national recession.\nMr. Soares is a center-leftist who has been one of the United States' closest allies in Europe and the man who led his country into the Common Market last month. #60 Years of Soldier Presidents Mr. Soares will be the first civilian President since a military coup in 1926. A revolution in 1974 overthrew the last dictator, Marcelo Caetano, but a popular army general, Antonio Ramalho Eanes, was elected President for two five-year terms after that, in part to maintain military support for the young democracy.\nUnder the Constitution Mr. Eanes could not succeed himself. Popular demands for a civilian successor cut short attempts to put up another military candidate.\nMr. Soares, assuming the role of a statesman in victory, said in a news conference tonight that the biggest winner today was this Iberian nation of 10 million people on the toe of Europe.\n''The transition phase of democracy is over,'' he said. ''The phase of a new, real democracy has begun.''\nMr. Freitas do Amaral graciously conceded defeat and ended his short statement in a separate news conference by saying, ''Forward Portugal,'' the slogan from his youth-oriented campaign. Rain Did Not Dampen Turnout\nDespite a drizzle that fell over much of the country on Election Day, there was a 78 percent turnout, much higher than in general and municipal elections last year.\nThe race was a classic one of right versus left and turned on which of the two candidates was seen as the one who would most provide long-term stability.\nMr. Freitas do Amaral won the first round in a field of four candidates three weeks ago with 46 percent of the vote, but was able to pick up only three percentage points more in today's runoff. Mr. Soares got just 25 percent in the first round, but he picked up the vote of the other two candidates, both leftists.\nMr. Soares, backed by blue-collar workers and intellectuals, carried the major cities of Lisbon, Oporto and Setubal and the Communist-dominated south.\nMr. Freitas do Amaral carried the conservative north and the youth vote, prompting his campaign chiefs to hold out hope that despite today's defeat the country's trend is to the right.\n''The results show that almost 50 percent of the people are for change,'' Mr. Cavaco Silva said tonight. ''We should not disillusion them.'' Communists Back Soares\nThe Communists appeared to vote solidly for Mr. Soares. The Moscow-line party controls about the 15 percent of the vote, but there were questions over whether many would stay home today. The party endorsed Mr. Soares, but only reluctantly because of a long-standing enmity between Mr. Soares and the party.\nMr. Freitas do Amaral charged that Mr. Soares would be beholden to the Communists, but Mr. Soares firmly maintained that he had offered nothing in exchange for Communist support.\nMr. Soares argued that as president he would be able to keep the left and unions in line while providing ideological balance to the centrist Government of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, a Social Democrat who strongly backed Mr. Freitas do Amaral.\nMr. Soares, however, holds a grudge against the Prime Minister that many political analysts fear could provoke disagreements between the President and the Prime Minister and further the country's political instability. It was Mr. Cavaco Silva who led the Social Democrats out of a coalition with the Socialists last summer, causing the downfall of Mr. Soares's Government. Power to Dismiss Governments\nThe President has less power than the Prime Minister, but he can delay legislation with vetoes and dismiss Governments that have lost parliamentary support.\nIf other parties block the Government's programs in Parliament, Mr. Soares can on his own dismiss Mr. Cavaco Silva's Government and then either appoint his own or call elections.\nBut Mr. Soares said he has no intention of carrying out such a move. Saying that he sees his task as ''the stabilizer and moderate or national life,'' Mr. Soares said tonight he would meet and seek to cooperate with all sectors of sectors of Portugese society and especially the Government.\n''I won't be president of a party, not even the ones who elected me,'' he said tonight. ''I will be president of all the Portugese.''\nSoares aides say that dismissal of the Government any time soon would also be unpopular. Mr. Cavaco Silva's decisive governing style is publicly admired and the country is tired of elections. Today's was the fourth in four months.\nPhoto of voters leaving polling station in Alges, Portugal (NYT/Ingeborg Lippman)"

                "Mounds is a candy bar made by Hershey's. It consists of a filling made of shredded coconut, which is enrobed in dark chocolate. The Mounds bar's sibling is Almond Joy, which is made the same way but with milk chocolate and a whole almond crowning the coconut.\n\nMounds' original slogan, \"Indescribably Delicious\", was created when Mounds ran a contest to come up with the best two words to sell a candy. Leon Weiss, the person who came up with the slogan, won $10, while Mounds went on to use the slogan in advertising and on the wrappers, still continuing today.\n\nMounds uses a packaging and logo design similar to its sister product, with Almond Joy's blue replaced by red, and the two candies are often advertised together. The candy's famous 1970s ad campaign used a jingle, \"Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't / Almond Joy's got nuts / Mounds don't\", written by Leon Carr.\n\nA limited-edition Mounds Island Orange candy bar was introduced in 2006 with orange-colored and -flavored coconut.\n\nA similar coconut-filled chocolate bar by the name of Bounty is manufactured by Mars, Incorporated and sold in markets other than the United States. The bars are sold in light or dark chocolate and are recognized by their blue (light chocolate) or red (dark chocolate) wrappers. Neither bar contains almonds.\n\nHistory \n\nMounds was created in 1920 as a single piece for 5 cents. In 1929, the Peter Paul Company purchased the line and had begun production. The format changed to two pieces that still sold for 5 cents, with the price rising to 10 cents after World War II.[http://snacks.cyberpunks.org/peterpaul.html Nearly everything you wanted to know about Peter Paul]  Mounds was made in milk chocolate, as well. \nDuring World War II, Peter Paul was faced with severe shortages of sugar and coconut which had been shipped from the Philippines before war broke out. Rather than sacrifice quality, the company discontinued some of its lesser selling brands and concentrated production on the Mounds candy bar. Over the years, Peter Paul added several products to its line, including the Almond Joy candy bar and York Peppermint Patties.\nCadbury and Peter Paul merged in 1978, and Hershey Foods purchased the company's U.S. operations in 1988.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIn Family Guy, Joe Swanson's favorite candy bar is the Mounds bar. In the episode \"Finders Keepers\", Joe states that he's eaten them \"two or three times a day for the past 25 years\". \n\nMounds is mentioned in Philip Roth's debut novel, Goodbye, Columbus.  The main character's aunt and uncle are described as \"sharing a Mounds Bar in the cindery darkness of their alley\". \n\nIn an opening monologue on NBC's television show Saturday Night Live, comedian Louis C.K. compared his love for Mounds bars with a child molester's love for molesting children."

                "Imperial War Museum | Military Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nIWM North\nImperial War Museums (IWM) is a British national museum organisation with branches at five locations in England, three of which are in London. Founded as the Imperial War Museum in 1917, the museum was intended to record the civil and military war effort and sacrifice of Britain and its Empire during the First World War . The museum's remit has since expanded to include all conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914. As of 2012, the museum aims 'to provide for, and to encourage, the study and understanding of the history of modern war and \"wartime experience\"'. [2]\nOriginally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill , the museum opened to the public in 1920. In 1924 the museum moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington, and finally in 1936 the museum acquired a permanent home which was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark . The outbreak of the Second World War saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference, but in the post-war period the museum entered a period of decline. The 1960s saw the museum redevelop its Southwark building, now referred to as Imperial War Museum London, which serves as the organisation's corporate headquarters . During the 1970s the museum began to expand onto other sites. The first, in 1976, was a historic airfield in Cambridgeshire now referred to as IWM Duxford . In 1978 the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Belfast became a branch of the museum, having previously been preserved for the nation by a private trust. In 1984 the Cabinet War Rooms , an underground wartime command centre, was opened to the public. From the 1980s onwards the museum's Bethlem building underwent a series of multimillion-pound redevelopments, completed in 2000. Finally, 2002 saw the opening of IWM North in Trafford , Greater Manchester, the fifth branch of the museum and the first in the north of England. In 2011 the museum rebranded itself as IWM, standing for 'Imperial War Museums'.\nThe museum's collections include archives of personal and official documents, photographs, film and video material, and oral history recordings; an extensive library, a large art collection, and examples of military vehicles and aircraft, equipment and other artefacts.\nThe museum is funded by government grants, charitable donations and revenue generation through commercial activity such as retailing, licensing, and publishing. Admission is free to IWM London and IWM North, but an admission fee is levied at the other branches. The museum is an exempt charity under the Charities Act 1993 and a non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport . As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards . Since October 2008, the museum's Director General has been Diane Lees .\nContents\nEdit\nSir Alfred Mond, photographed between 1910 and 1920.\nOn 27 February 1917 Sir Alfred Mond , an MP and First Commissioner of Works, wrote to the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to propose the establishment of a National War Museum. This proposal was accepted by the War Cabinet on 5 March 1917 and the decision announced in The Times on 26 March. A committee was established, chaired by Mond, to oversee the collection of material to be exhibited in the new museum. [3] [4]\nThis National War Museum Committee set about collecting material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, the production of munitions , and women's war work . [5] There was an early appreciation of the need for exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway , the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must 'be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals'. [6] The museum's first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes , who had previously been curator of the Tower of London armouries. [7] In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and Field Marshal Haig , who reportedly took great interest in his work. [8] In December 1917 the name was changed to the Imperial War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum. [9]\nThe museum was opened by The King at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond addressed the King on the behalf of committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one who took part in the war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice'. [10] Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India, South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. [11] While the Act was being debated, some Parliamentarians felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War'. [12] On the August Bank Holiday 1920, the first public holiday since the museum's opening, 94,179 visitors were received, [13] and by November 1921, 2,290,719 had visited the museum. [14]\nRelocation 1924–1936\nEdit\nIn 1924 the museum moved to the Imperial Institute building (demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to make way for Imperial College ) in South Kensington. While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums, the accommodation itself proved cramped and inadequate [15] and in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the River Thames in Southwark.\nThe Imperial Institute, South Kensington, where the museum was located from 1924–1936\nThe building, designed by James Lewis [16] was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital which had been vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by Lord Rothermere , who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely in order to provide a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park , after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear'. [17] The 'distinguishing dome' was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital's chapel. [18] The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later King George VI ) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.\nSecond World War and after: 1939–1966\nEdit\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict. [19] In November 1939, during the so-called ' Phoney War ', the museum appeared in the opening sequence of the GPO Film Unit production The First Days, in which children are seen playing on some of the museum's German artillery pieces captured during the First World War. [20] With the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk in May/June 1940, however, the British Army's shortage of equipment saw eighteen of the museum's artillery pieces return to military service. [21] The museum's trench clubs were used by the Home Guard , while other items such as sights and optical instruments were returned to the Ministry of Supply. The museum refused, however, to return some historic items such as a naval gun from HMS Lance (which had fired Britain's first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by Victoria Cross -winning boy seaman Jack Cornwell . [21] The museum initially remained open but was closed for the duration of the war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz . On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Seaplane , which had flown at the Battle of Jutland , was destroyed. [22] While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school. [23] In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department . These included the submarine fuel pipeline PLUTO, the fog dispersal method FIDO , and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier . [24] However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946. [22] [25] A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949. [26] [27]\nIn 1953, with Commonwealth forces engaged in Korea and Malaya the museum began its current policy of collecting material from all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were involved. [22] However, despite this expansion of remit, the early postwar period was a period of decline for the museum. Dr Noble Frankland, the museum's Director from 1960 to 1982, described the museum's galleries in 1955 as appearing 'dingy and neglected [and in a] dismal state of decay' the museum's 'numerous stunning exhibits' notwithstanding. [28]\nRedevelopment and expansion: 1966–2012\nEdit\nIn August 2009 the Museum announced the creation of the Imperial War Museum Foundation. Chaired by Jonathon Harmsworth the foundation was charged with raising funds to support the redevelopment of Imperial War Museum London's permanent galleries. [55] In December 2010 plans were announced to redevelop IWM London's First World War gallery in time for the conflict's centenary in 2014, [56] and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge became the foundation's patron. [57] In a speech at IWM London on 11 October 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron announced an additional £5 million of government funding to support the museum's redevelopment, as part of funding arrangements to facilitate national centenary commemorations. [58] The redevelopment is intended to provide new gallery spaces and a new central hall, easier navigation and improved visitor facilities. [59] In preparation for building work, a number of galleries were closed during September 2012, [60] and by December 2012 over sixty large objects had been removed from the IWM London atrium for conservation at Duxford. [61] To allow building work to go ahead, IWM London closed to the public on 2 January 2013. The museum partially reopened on 29 July 2013. [62]\nBranches\nEdit\nFrom the 1970s onwards the Imperial War Museum began to expand onto other sites. The first branch, Imperial War Museum Duxford opened to the public on a regular basis in June 1976. [63] HMS Belfast became a branch of the museum in 1978. [64] The Cabinet War Rooms opened in 1984, and Imperial War Museum North in 2002.\nImperial War Museum London\nFile:BethlemSteelEngraving1828.png\nThe museum has occupied the former Bethlem Royal Hospital on Lambeth Road since 1936. The hospital building was designed by the hospital surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by John Gandy and other architects, and construction completed in October 1814. The hospital consisted of a range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to Lambeth Road , with a central entrance under a portico . [65]\nThe building was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke . In order to provide more space, he added blocks at either end of the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site. [65]\nThe building remained substantially unchanged until vacated by the hospital in 1930. After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere , the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 the ground floor of the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to William Orpen and John Lavery ), a gallery on women's war work , and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings. [66] This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II listed building status. [67]\nThe original hospital building is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000 m2 of gallery space of which 4,600 m2 was new, and the second provided a further 1,600 m2. [37] The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund [68] and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. [69] Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces , espionage and covert operations . The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor, a vaulted roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft , 241 medals in total. [37] [70] [71]\nAll Saints Annexe\nEdit\nIn 1986 the museum acquired the All Saints Annexe, a former hospital building in Austral Street off West Square . The 1867 building, which backs onto Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park , was originally an orphanage opened by local philanthropist Charlotte Sharman , then later used as a hospital. It houses the museum's photographic, film and sound archives, and offices. [72] [73]\nImperial War Museum Duxford\nThe Map Room of the Cabinet War Rooms\nThe Cabinet War Rooms is an underground complex that served as a British government command centre throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan . Their historical value was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30–40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted. [36] The museum agreed to take over the administration of the site in 1982, [36] a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill . Thatcher opened the War Rooms in April 1984. In 2003 a further suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. [79] In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850 m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The development of the Churchill Museum cost a further £6 million. The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre , via an 'electronic filing cabinet'. [80] The museum was renamed the Churchill War Rooms in 2010.\nImperial War Museum North\nEntrance of Imperial War Museum North in Manchester\nThe Imperial War Museum North was opened in Trafford , Greater Manchester in 2002. It was the first branch of the museum outside southeast England, and the first to be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind , Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind’s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays , was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. [81] Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings , a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5 million. [82] [83]\nThe museum's first floor main gallery space houses the permanent exhibitions. These consist of a chronological display which runs around the gallery's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in 'silos' within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture. The main gallery, described as cavernous and dramatic, [84] [85] includes objects such as a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier jet, and a British 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army 's first shot of the First World War. [86] The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery. [87]\nCollections\nSee also: Category:Collection of the Imperial War Museum .\nThe museum's collection includes this photograph of Montgomery in his tank along with the tank itself, his command caravans and staff car, [88] and his papers. [89] [90]\nThe Imperial War Museum's original collections date back to the material amassed by the National War Museum Committee. The present departmental organisation came into being during the 1960s as part of Frankland's reorganisation of the museum. The 1970s saw oral history gain increasing prominence and in 1972 the museum created the Department of Sound Records (now the Sound Archive) to record interviews with individuals who had experienced the First World War. The museum maintains an online database of its collections . [91]\nDocuments\nEdit\nThe museum's documents archive seeks to collect and preserve the private papers of individuals who have experienced modern warfare. The archive's holdings range from the papers of senior British and Commonwealth army, navy and air officers, to the letters, diaries and memoirs of lower-ranked servicemen and of civilians. The collection includes the papers of Field Marshals Bernard Montgomery , [90] and Sir John French . [92] The archive also includes large collections of foreign documents, such as captured German Second World War documents previously held by the Cabinet Office Historical Section, Air Historical Branch and other British government bodies. The foreign collection also includes captured Japanese material transferred from the Cabinet Office. The collection also includes files on Victoria and George Cross recipients, and correspondence relating to the BBC documentary The Great War. [93] The documents collection also includes the UK National Inventory of War Memorials . [94] In 2012 the museum reported its documents collection to contain 24,800 collections of papers. [95]\nArt\nEdit\nThe museum's art collection includes paintings, prints, drawings, sculpture, and works in film, photography and sound . [96] The collection originated during the First World War, when the museum acquired works that it had itself commissioned,  as well as works commissioned by the Ministry of Information's British War Memorials Committee. As early as 1920 the art collection held over 3,000 works [97] and included pieces by John Singer Sargent , Wyndham Lewis , John Nash and Christopher Nevinson . Notable First World War works include Sargent's Gassed . [98] The collection expanded again after the Second World War, receiving thousands of works sponsored by the Ministry of Information's War Artists Advisory Committee. [99] In 1972 the museum established the Artistic Records Committee (since renamed the Art Commissions Committee) to commission artists to cover contemporary conflicts. [100] Commissioned artists include Ken Howard , Linda Kitson , John Keane , Peter Howson , Steve McQueen (see Queen and Country ) and Langlands & Bell , responding to conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Falklands, the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] The collection also includes over twenty thousand items of publicity material such as posters, postcards, and proclamations from both world wars, and more recent material such as posters issued by anti-war organisations such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Stop the War Coalition . [96] The museum's collection is represented in digital resources such as the Visual Arts Data Service (VADS), [106] and Google Art Project . [107] In 2012 the museum reported the total size of its art collection as 84,980 items. [95]\nA still from The Battle of the Somme, preserved by the museum's film archive.\nFilm\nEdit\nThe museum's Film and Video Archive is one of the oldest film archives in the world. [108] [109] [110] The archive preserves a range of historically significant film and video material, including the official British film record of the First World War . Notable among the archive's First World War holdings is The Battle of the Somme, a pioneering 1916 documentary film (which was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2005), and Der Magische Gürtel, a German 1917 propaganda film about the submarine U-35 . [111] The archive's Second World War holdings include unedited film shot by British military cameramen, which document combat actions such as the British landings on D-Day in June 1944, [112] and the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. [113] The archive also holds government information films and propaganda features such as Target for Tonight and Desert Victory . The archive's post-Second World War collections include material from the Korean War , Cold War material, the former film library of NATO , and material produced by the United Nations UNTV service in Bosnia. As an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, the archive continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. The archive also seeks to acquire amateur film taken by both service personnel and civilian cameramen. [114] Material from the collection was used to make a number of well-known TV documentary series including The Great War and The World at War . In 2012 the museum reported the size of its film archive as being in excess of 23,000 hours of film, video and digital footage. [95]\nPhotographs\nEdit\nThe museum's Photograph Archive preserves photographs by official, amateur and professional photographers. The collection includes the official British photographic record of the two world wars; the First World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Ernest Brooks and John Warwick Brooke . [115] [116] The archive also holds 150,000 British aerial photographs from the First World War, [117] the largest collection of its kind. [118] The Second World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Bill Brandt , Cecil Beaton [119] and Bert Hardy . [120] Like the Film Archive, the Photograph Archive is an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, and as such continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its photographic holdings as approximately 11 million images in 17,263 collections. [95]\nExhibits\nEdit\nThe museum's exhibits collection includes a wide range of objects, organised into numerous smaller collections such as uniforms, badges, insignia and flags (including a Canadian Red Ensign carried at Vimy Ridge in 1917, [121] a Union flag from the 1942 British surrender of Singapore , [122] and another found among the wreckage of the World Trade Center following the September 11 attacks ); [123] personal mementoes, souvenirs and miscellanea such as trench art ; [124] [125] orders, medals and decorations (including collections of Victoria and George Crosses ); military equipment; firearms and ammunition, ordnance, edged weapons, clubs (such as trench clubs ) [126] and other weapons, and vehicles, aircraft and ships. The museum holds the national collection of modern firearms. [95] The firearms collection includes a rifle used by T. E. Lawrence , [127] and an automatic pistol owned by Winston Churchill . [128] The ordnance collection includes artillery pieces that participated in notable battles, such as the Néry gun, a field gun that was used during the 1914 action at Néry , [129] and equipment captured from enemy forces. The museum's vehicles collection includes Ole Bill , a bus used by British forces in the First World War, [130] and a number of vehicles used by Field Marshal Montgomery during the Second World War. [131] The museum's aircraft collection includes aircraft that are notable for their rarity, such as the only complete and original Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in existence and one of only two surviving TSR-2 strike aircraft, [132] [133] and aircraft associated with particular actions, such as a Supermarine Spitfire flown during the Battle of Britain .  The museum's naval collection includes HM Coastal Motor Boat 4 and a midget submarine HMS XE8 . [134] [135] In 2012 the museum reported its exhibits collection to contain 155,000 objects and a further 357 vehicles and aircraft. [95]\nLibrary\nEdit\nThe museum's library is a national reference collection on modern conflict, and holds works on all aspects of warfare, including regimental or unit histories (such as 789 rare German unit histories from the First World War), [136] technical manuals, biographical material and works on war's social, cultural, economic, political and military aspects. The library also holds printed ephemera such as the Imperial War Museum Stamp Collection , [137] leaflets and ration books, printed proclamations, newspapers, trench magazines (such the Wipers Times ) and trench maps . [136] In 2012 the museum reported its library collection to contain over 80,000 items of historic importance (such as maps, proclamations and rare books) and a further 254,000 items of reference material. [95]\nSound\nEdit\nThe museum's Sound Archive holds 33,0000 sound recordings, including a large collection of oral history recordings of witnesses to conflicts since 1914. [138] The museum's sound collection originated in 1972 with the creation of the Department of Sound Records and the instigation of an oral history recording programme. The sound collection opened to the public in July 1977. [139] The collection also includes recordings made by the BBC during the Second World War, actuality sound effects, broadcasts, speeches and poetry. As part of the museum's First World War centenary programme, the museum is producing Voices of the First World War, a podcast series drawing upon the museum's oral history recordings. [140] In 2012 the museum reported the size of its sound collection as 37,000 hours. [95]\nGovernance\nEdit\nThe Imperial War Museum is an executive non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport , from which it receives financial support in the form of a grant-in-aid . The governance of the museum is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, originally established by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920, [11] later amended by the Imperial War Museum Act 1955 [141] and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 and other relevant legislation. The board comprises a president (currently Prince Edward, Duke of Kent ) who is appointed by the sovereign, and fourteen members appointed in varying proportions by the Prime Minister, and the Foreign, Defence , and Culture Secretaries . Seven further members are Commonwealth High Commissioners appointed ex officio by their respective governments. As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards and his deputy is Lieutenant-General Sir John Kiszely . [142] [143] [144] Past chairmen have included Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin (1967–77), [145] Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon Willis [146] and Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Grandy (trustee 1971–78, Chairman 1978–89). During the Second World War Grandy had commanded RAF Duxford, and was chairman during the planning of Duxford's American Air Museum , which opened in 1997. [147] [148]\nThe museum's Director-General is answerable to the trustees and acts as accounting officer. Since 1917 the museum has had six directors. The first was Sir Martin Conway , a noted art historian, mountaineer and explorer. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts to map the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas, and was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of Director until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley. Bradley had served in the First World War in the Middlesex Regiment before being invalided out in 1917. He later became acquainted with Charles ffoulkes, who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum's poster collection. [149] Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr Noble Frankland . Frankland had served as a navigator in RAF Bomber Command , winning a Distinguished Flying Cross . While a Cabinet Office official historian he co-authored a controversial official history of the RAF strategic air campaign against Germany. Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr Alan Borg who had previously been at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts . In 1995 Borg moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum and was succeeded by Sir Robert Crawford, who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968. Upon Crawford's retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by Diane Lees, previously Director of the V&A Museum of Childhood . She was noted in the media as the first woman appointed to lead a British national museum . [150]\nReferences",
                "Imperial War Museum | View from the Mirror\nView from the Mirror\n| 17 Comments\n2014 will mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War One.\nRaging from July 28th 1914 to 11th November 1918, this hellish conflict was the world’s first truly modern war, characterized by the widespread use of tanks, aircraft, heavy artillery and poison gas.\nA WWI Tank.\nSo intense was the fighting it is said that, during particularly heavy clashes, the thunder of guns could be heard echoing as far away as London.\nLeaving Europe with deep physical and psychological scars, the Great War claimed a grand total of 16 million lives and left a further 21 million injured.\n‘Gassed’ by John Singer Sargent, 1919. This painting is part of the Imperial War Museum’s collection.\nOn a personal level, my Great Great Grandfather- who was also named Robert- was shot at the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917.\nAlthough he was lucky enough to survive (had he not, I would not be sitting here writing this now), the bullet he took remained in his body for the rest of his life.\nWounded soldiers at Passchendaele, Belgium, 1917.\n*\nTo mark this sombre landmark in our relatively recent history- and as my personal tribute to all of those who died, whatever their nationality- I have decided to start a new series which, over time, will take a look at London’s many World War One memorials and the stories behind them.\nI shall begin with ‘The Machine Gun Corps’ memorial.\nThe Machine Gun Corps Memorial\nHyde Park Corner\nLocation of the Machine Gun Corps Memorial at Hyde Park Corner (image: Google).\nWhen war first erupted in the summer of 1914, the British Military were still very much of a 19th century mind-set, confident that traditional infantry and cavalry based tactics would be sufficient enough force to seize victory… a tragically naïve assumption which was starkly portrayed in the 2011 film adaptation of Michael Morpurgo’s book, ‘Warhorse’ (please click below to view):\nAfter a few bloody months on the Western Front, it soon became clear in which direction the conflict was heading, leading to the formation of the Machine Gun Corps in October 1915.\nMachine Gun Corps badge (image: Wikipedia).\nDuring WWI, the Machine Gun Corps were deployed in a wide range of theaters including France, Belgium, Palestine, Egypt, East Africa and Italy.\nBecause of the nature of their weaponry, troops from the MGC often fought well beyond the front line; a factor which earned the Corps both a high casualty rate and a darkly comic nickname… ‘The Suicide Club’.\nGas masked troops from the Machine Gun Corps at the Battle of the Somme, 1916.\nSeven members of the Machine Gun Corps were awarded the Victoria Cross; the highest possible accolade for bravery.\nThe Memorial\nUnveiled in 1925, the memorial to the fallen of the Machine Gun Corps is embodied by a statue known as the ‘Boy David’; the Biblical figure who proved his worth after slaying the fearsome giant, Goliath.\nThe ‘Boy David’ Machine Gun Corps Memorial.\nAlthough we tend to associate David with heroism and triumph over adversity, his representation in this case is naked; something which suggests a sense of vulnerability.\nThe statue’s plinth includes a quote from the Book of Samuel; “Saul hath slain his thousands but David his tens of thousands”; a grim nod to the impact which the Machine Gun Corps had on the course of the war.\nOn either side of the statue sit two ‘Vickers’ machine guns, each encircled with laurel wreaths. These fearsome weapons are actually real models… so it is some comfort that they are now encased in bronze.\nThe rear of the statue provides a brief history of the Corps:\n“The Machine Gun Corps of which His Majesty King George V was Colonel in Chief, was formed by Royal Warrant dated the 14th day of October 1915.\nThe Corps served in France, Flanders, Russia, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia, Salonica, India, Afghanistan and East Africa.\nThe last unit of the Corps to be disbanded was the Depot at Shorncliffe on the 15th day of July 1922.\nThe total number who served in the Corps was some 11,500 Officers and 159,000 other ranks of whom 1120 Officers and 12,671 other ranks killed and 2,881 Officers and 45,377 other ranks were wounded, missing or prisoners of war.”\nMachine Gun Corps troops at Arras.\n*\nWhen first erected, the memorial stood on Grosvenor Place; just south of Hyde Park Corner.\nThis first site was short-lived, with major road works soon requiring the statue’s removal. It was placed in storage for many years, finally returning in 1963 when it was placed at its present site on the northern side of Hyde Park Corner, backing onto one of London’s busiest road junctions.\nLooking towards the memorial at Hyde Park Corner (image: Google).\nAn annual observance is held at the statue on the 2nd Saturday of every May.\nFrancis Derwent Wood\nPerhaps the most poignant factor about the Machine Gun Corps memorial is the story behind its sculptor; Francis Derwent Wood.\nFrancis Derwent Wood.\nFrancis Derwent Wood was born in the Lake District in 1871 and went onto teach sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art.\nWhen war broke out in 1914, he was too old for military service, so volunteered to work in the bustling hospital wards, coming to be based at the 3rd London General Hospital in Wandsworth.\nThe 3rd London General Hospital.\nOriginally built in the 1850s as a home and school for orphans, this grand building was requisitioned in WW1 for use as a military hospital.\nTo cope with the sheer number of wounded troops being brought it, a temporary platform and station were built on the hospital’s western side (which backs onto one of the main lines into Clapham Junction).\nA field behind the hospital (which is today a cricket ground) became an overflow area, lined with row after row of marquees standing in as temporary wards.\nPostcard displaying the 3rd London General Hospital, Wandsworth. The railway lines which delivered wounded troops can be seen to the south, the overflow tent-wards towards the north.\nToday, the former hospital is now known as the ‘Royal Victoria Patriotic Building’; a complex of apartments, workshops, studios, a drama school and a restaurant called ‘ Le Gothique ’.\nThe former 3rd London General Hospital today… now known as the Royal Victoria Patriotic Building (image: Google).\n*\nAt the 3rd London General Hospital, Francis Derwent Wood encountered many young men who had suffered horrific injuries inflicted by the terrifying new weaponry.\nCanadian patients at the 3rd London General Hospital, Wandsworth.\nFacial traumas were especially commonplace; if a squaddie quickly popped his head over the trench, an unexpected explosion or burst of enemy fire could have catastrophic results.\nIn one account, an American soldier, shot in the skull in 1918, described the experience; “It sounded to me like someone had dropped a glass bottle into a porcelain bathtub… a barrel of whitewash tipped over and it seemed that everything in the world turned white.”\nIn some cases, victims literally lost half their face… yet somehow managed to survive.\nAlthough plastic surgery techniques were being pioneered at the time, there were some unfortunate souls who even this could not help.\nExposed to such tragedies, Francis Derwent Wood had a brain-wave.\nRealising that his artistic skills may be able to help those with extensive facial scars, he took it upon himself to set up the ‘Masks for Facial Disfigurement Department’ within the hospital where, beginning in March 1916, he began to use his expertise to create custom masks for his patient’s shattered faces.\nFrancis Derwent Wood working on a patient’s mask (image: The Imperial War Museum).\nTaking up to a month to create, each mask, which was made from ultra-lightweight metal and painted in enamel to match the wearer’s skin tone, was a work of art in itself, designed to fully disguise the affected area.\nWhere eyebrows and moustaches were required, slivers of tinfoil were used- rather like the technique used on ancient Greek statues.\nPatients at the hospital quickly gave the department an affectionate nickname; ‘The Tin Nose Shop.’\nBits and bobs from Derwent Wood’s ‘Tin Nose Shop’ (image: The Imperial War Museum).\nThis creative solution did wonders for the morale of young men faced with a future of horrified stares and social exclusion- in Sidcup for example, which was also home to a facial hospital, certain park benches were designated for the use of patients…and were painted blue as a warning to passers-by of a more sensitive nature.\nInterviewed in The Lancet in 1917, Francis said; “My work begins where the work of the surgeon is complete…The patient acquires his old self-respect, self-assurance, self-reliance… takes once more to a pride in his personal appearance. His presence is no longer a source of melancholy to himself nor the sadness of his relatives and friends.”\nA wounded soldier examining the beginnings of his facial mask (image: The Imperial War Museum).\nDerwent Wood’s work was soon noticed by the American sculptor, Anna Coleman.\nAnna Coleman (image: Wikipedia).\nAfter liaising with Derwent Wood and with support from the American Red Cross, Anna opened her own mask studio in Paris, where she continued the pioneering work on severely wounded French and American troops.\nA video of this studio survives, which gives a good idea of the process involved at the hospitals in Paris and London (please click below to view):\nUnsurprisingly, Anna Coleman and Francis Derwent Wood received many grateful letters from those they’d helped.\nOne particular response is heart-breaking in what it says;\n“Thanks to you, I will have a home… the woman I love no longer finds me repulsive.”\nClose up of the Boy David statue…\n*\nFrancis Derwent Wood’s studio was wound down in 1919.\nAlthough he was able to help several hundred men, this was a mere drop in a very sad ocean- over 20,000 would return from the continent with facial wounds.\nAfter the war, Francis was commissioned to create memorials in honour of the men who never returned. These works include a statue for Liverpool’s Cotton Association, ‘Humanity Overcoming War’ in Bradford and work on the memorial plinth in his home town of Keswick.\nFrancis Derwent Wood’s sculpture for the Liverpool Cotton Exchange (image: Wikipedia).\nHe also created a controversial sculpture of a crucified soldier; ‘Canada’s Golgotha’ which can be seen in the Canadian War Museum , Ottawa.\n‘Canada’s Golgotha’… (image: Wikipedia).\nLondon’s Machine Gun Corps memorial was one of Derwent Wood’s last pieces. He died just two years after its unveiling.\nIn 1929, a small, bronze copy of the Boy David was made by Edward Bainbridge Copnall as a memorial to Francis Derwent Wood.\nThe Boy David modello by Edward Bainbridge, 1929 (image: Copyright Paul Farmer, via Geograph).\nBequeathed by the Chelsea Arts Club, it can today be seen on the north side of Chelsea Embankment, overlooking Albert Bridge.\nSpread across an impressive slope in Sydenham, South London, Crystal Palace Park is one of the capital’s most intriguing green spaces.\nSatellite view of Crystal Palace Park (image: Google)\nOrigins\nThe locale has always been a noted beauty spot.\nBefore Crystal Palace Park was established, the area formed the grounds of ‘Penge Place’ (‘Penge’ deriving from the Celtic word, ‘Penceat’ meaning ‘on the edge of a wood’); a large, Tudor-style manor house built at the beginning of the 19th century by Edward Blore.\nPenge Place (image: Ideal Homes)\nIn its present form, the park owes its existence to an event which took place in 1851- The Great Exhibition; a five-month long celebration of all the world had to offer in terms of culture and technology.\nInside The Great Exhibition.\nEssentially the world’s first expo, The Great Exhibition was hosted north of the Thames in Hyde Park, housed within a vast, purpose-built structure forged from metal and glass….a building which the satirical magazine, Punch dubbed the “Crystal Palace”.\nThe Crystal Palace in its original location; the south-eastern corner of Hyde Park.\nBetween May and October 1851 millions from across both the UK and the world flocked to wonder at the Victorian marvel, firmly planting the building in the public psyche.\nBy the time the exhibition closed its doors, much of the British public had grown exceptionally fond of their ‘People’s Palace’ and there was great concern that the temporary structure was about to be lost forever.\nLuckily, Salvation was at hand thanks to two solicitors- Messrs Leech and Farquhar who suggested that the palace be dismantled and resurrected elsewhere. This plan was quickly adopted and, within less than a year, a site in Sydenham had been earmarked as the new home; a location which the palace’s original architect, Sir Joseph Paxton, described as “the most beautiful spot in the world” for his celebrated creation.\nA huge bust of Sir Joseph Paxton, which can seen in Crystal Palace Park.\nIn just two years the huge structure was carefully taken apart and transported to the south London green spot where it was skilfully reassembled and expanded.\nThe second incarnation of the Crystal Palace incorporated galleries representing the histories and cultures of numerous nations. For these installations, specialist craftsmen from abroad were drafted in to create the representations of their homelands. As one guide-book from the time noted, many firm friendships between these fellows and their British counterparts were made in the “palace of peace.”\nReconstruction work, pictured in an 1854 edition of the ‘London Illustrated News’.\nDespite the enthusiasm, the project was not without tragedy.\nIn August 1853 during the building’s reconstruction, a section of scaffolding collapsed, plunging ten workmen 170ft to their deaths.\nFollowing this disaster, 2,000 fellow workers attended a meeting at which it was declared “the working-class are the best protectors of their own interests” and that if the 2,000 colleagues “would each abridge themselves of a pint of ale a week, they might raise a fund of £500 a year for the relief of widows and orphans…”\nAftermath of the deadly scaffold collapse. (Image: Sydenham & Forest Hill history).\nThe ten men were buried together nearby at St Bartholomew’s church, Sydenham (where their shared grave can still be seen), the funeral attended by 1,000 mourners.\n*\nA new park for London\nIn June 1854 and with Queen Victoria in attendance, the relocated Crystal Palace once again opened its doors to an eager public.\nThe Crystal Palace at its new home in Sydenham.\nThe new location was well connected with two purpose built railway stations; Crystal Palace Low Level on the park’s southern side (still open today) and Crystal Palace High Level.\nCrystal Palace Station (originally Crystal Palace Low Level. Image: Wikipedia)\nOriginally located on the western edge of the park, the High Level station closed in 1954 and has long since vanished, the site now covered by modern housing.\nCrystal Palace High Level station, 1865. (Image: London Illustrated News).\nIf you look carefully however, a few remnants of the old station can still be glimpsed. Alongside the new homes, just below Crystal Palace Parade, you’ll find a long retaining wall, which once run parallel to the station.\nOld retaining wall on Spinney Gardens.\nIf you peer over the opposite side of Crystal Palace Parade, you’ll spot the dilapidated remains of a once ornate subway which provided a direct walkway between the station and the palace itself.\nAriel view of the derelict subway (please note: there is no public access. Image: Google).\n*\nFor those who wished to travel to the attraction by road, accommodation for three hundred horses-a sort of equine garage- was provided at the ‘Paxton Stables’, located behind the nearby Woodman Inn on Westow Hill, where your steed could rest for the price of one shilling and sixpence; “including a feed of corn and all other expenses.”\nToday, ‘Joanna’s’ restaurant stands on the site of the old pub, although the cobbled road which led into to the horse facility can still be seen.\nSite of the old ‘Woodman’ Inn. The cobbled road led to ‘Paxton’s Stables’.\n*\nPark of delights\nInside the rebooted Crystal Palace there was a stunning amount for visitors to indulge in, with galleries showcasing art and culture from across the ages; Greek, Egyptian, Roman (including a court dedicated to the doomed town of Pompeii), Italian renaissance, Byzantine, Medieval and much more.\nThe Egyptian Court.\nThe Pompeian Court\nThere were also galleries for musical instruments, fabrics, sculpture and various other modern technologies.\nThe surrounding gardens provided even more delights, with impressive arrays of flora, a park showcasing large dinosaur models (more of which in part two) and a system of powerful fountains which, when first inaugurated, were capable of firing jets of water 200ft into the air.\nThis impressive aquatic display was powered by two mighty water towers; each sanding 282 ft. high- 107 ft. taller than Nelson’s Column and designed by legendary engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel.\nBrunel’s Crystal Palace water towers.\nTo keep the fountains operating at such levels, the towers were required to deal with a colossal 120,000 gallons of water per minute. However, it soon became apparent that the structures were unable to cope with such force and, fearing that the towers may rupture, the park’s owners had little choice but to wind the fountains down.\n*\nMore successful of the outdoor features was the Pneumatic Railway; a short, experimental line linking one park gate to another.\nCrystal Palace Pneumatic Railway.\nThe system consisted of an airtight pipe, sunk halfway into the ground, through which a single carriage was puffed from one end to the other- rather like a giant pea shooter.\nMany visitors paid a few pence to ride this novelty but despite its popularity the railway remained open to the public for just one year. Its quick disappearance has since led to many an urban legend suggesting that the Victorian railcar lies buried somewhere deep beneath the park…\n*\nFor the first thirty years at its new location, the Crystal Palace thrived, attracting an average of two million visitors per year.\nCountless exhibitions were held; dog and cat shows, livestock shows, photography exhibitions, acrobatic displays, circuses, musical concerts and so on.\nA selection of Crystal Palace dog show winners… (Image: London Illustrated News).\nFirework extravaganzas were also popular and heads of state from across the globe came to enjoy the delights of the glistening landmark.\nIn 1911, the complex staged its biggest event ever; The Festival of Empire in which “representations of possessions beyond the seas”- such as Indian tea plantations, Australian vineyards and South African gold mines- sprang up around the park like a miniature, global village.\nTo help visitors access these dioramas, organizers laid down ‘The Red Route’; a mile and a half long electric railway with stations for each country.\nThe ‘Red Route’ line running past a mock-up of an Indian tea plantation.\nInto the 20th century\nDespite such extravagance, the Crystal Palace itself was struggling financially.\nSince the turn of the century, the 1850s building- which it must be remembered had originally been designed to stand for a matter of months- was growing increasingly shabby.\nOver the past decades, it had suffered fire and storm damage. Random panes of glass would often become loose and drop out and the framework required constant painting. The building’s vast size was proving too costly to maintain and, shortly after the Festival of Empire, the Crystal Palace was declared bankrupt.\nWar and a new lease of life\nEventually bailed out by the Earl of Plymouth, the huge venue stumbled back to its feet, making a few pounds on the side with newly installed banks of slot machines.\nAnother innovation was created by a chap called Edmund Dangerfield (editor of The Motor magazine) who, in one of the palace’s wings, set up the world’s very first museum dedicated to the motor-car.\nThe world’s first motor museum at Crystal Palace (image: National Motor Museum).\nFollowing the outbreak of WWI, the Crystal Palace and its surrounding park were closed to the public and commandeered by the military; the facilities being used to train 125,000 servicemen.\nDue to the war emergency, the cars from Dangerfield’s motor museum were given little consideration; with those that could not be returned to their original donors being hastily dumped on waste ground near Charing Cross.\n*\nAt the conclusion of the Great War the Crystal Palace found another role as a huge demob centre.\nOnce its duties to King and country were over, the attraction experienced a brief renaissance thanks to James Buckland; the newly installed manager who loved the Victorian icon so much that he’d named his daughter ‘Chrystal’.\nDuring this period, the Crystal Palace provided a home for the very first incarnation of the Imperial War Museum; the weapons on display illustrating the horror of trench warfare which was still very fresh in people’s minds.\nThe Imperial War Museum at Crystal Palace, early 1920s (Image: Imperial War Museum).\nThe Imperial War Museum remained at the Palace until 1924 before moving onto South Kensington and then Lambeth, where it has remained since 1936.\nIn the early 1930s, the Crystal Palace played an important role in the early history of television when the Scottish inventor, John Logie Baird decided to move his studio onto the premises, using Brunel’s two old water towers as masts for his antennas.

So intense was the blaze that its red haze could be seen as far away as Brighton and Margate, the disaster earning the awful title of Britain’s largest peace-time blaze.\nCrystal Palace, November 30th 1936 (London Illustrated News).\nDespite the exhaustive efforts of 430 firemen, 88 fire engines and 749 police officers the Crystal Palace was utterly destroyed; the London landmark turned into a smouldering ruin of twisted metal within a matter of hours.\nThe awful aftermath…\nA news-reel from the period covering the heartbreaking event can be viewed below.\nThe only features to survive the inferno were Brunel’s two water towers which remained in situ until the outbreak of WWII- when they were deliberately destroyed in what is believed to have been an attempt to thwart enemy bombers using the landmarks as navigational aids.\nHappier days… Crystal Palace & one of Brunel’s water towers, as seen from Anerley Hill (image: Wikipedia).\n*\nAmongst the ruins…\nToday, the site of the old Crystal Palace on the park’s western edge is an eerie, melancholy place characterized by windswept staircases and lonely statues; many of which have been callously vandalized.\nIn 1953, American poet, James Broughton used the atmospheric ruins as the backdrop to his short, avant-garde film, The Pleasure Garden which featured Hattie Jacques and John Le Mesurier and sought to inject a little cheer into post-war Britain…\n‘The Pleasure Garden’, 1953.",
                "Imperial War Museum : definition of Imperial War Museum and synonyms of Imperial War Museum (English)\nChurchill War Rooms  · HMS Belfast  · Imperial War Museum Duxford  · Imperial War Museum North\nThe Imperial War Museum is a British national museum organisation with branches at five locations in England , three of which are in London . The museum was founded during the First World War in 1917 and intended as a record of the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and her Empire . Today the museum gives its mission as \"to enable people to have an informed understanding of modern war and its impact on individuals and society\". [6]\nOriginally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill , the museum opened to the public in 1920. In 1924 the museum moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington , and finally in 1936 the museum acquired a permanent home which was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark . The outbreak of the Second World War saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference, but in the post-war period the museum entered a period of decline. The 1960s saw the museum redevelop its Southwark building, now referred to as Imperial War Museum London, which serves as the organisation's corporate headquarters . During the 1970s the museum began to expand onto other sites. The first, in 1976, was a historic airfield in Cambridgeshire now referred to as Imperial War Museum Duxford . In 1978 the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Belfast became a branch of the museum, having previously been preserved for the nation by a private trust. In 1984 the Cabinet War Rooms , an underground wartime command centre, was opened to the public. From the 1980s onwards the museum's Bethlem building underwent a series of multimillion-pound redevelopments, completed in 2000. Finally, 2002 saw the opening of Imperial War Museum North in Trafford , Greater Manchester , the fifth branch of the museum and the first in the north of England.\nThe museum's collections include archives of personal and official documents, photographs , film and video material, and oral history recordings; an extensive library , a large art collection, and examples of military vehicles and aircraft, equipment and other artefacts.\nThe museum is funded by government grants, charitable donations and revenue generation through commercial activity such as retailing, licensing, and publishing. Admission is free to Imperial War Museum London and Imperial War Museum North, but an admission fee is levied at the other branches. The museum is an exempt charity under the Charities Act 1993 and a non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport . As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards . Since October 2008, the museum's Director General has been Diane Lees.\nContents\n  Establishment: 1917–1924\n  Sir Alfred Mond, photographed between 1910 and 1920.\nOn 27 February 1917 Sir Alfred Mond , an MP and First Commissioner of Works, wrote to the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to propose the establishment of a National War Museum. This proposal was accepted by the War Cabinet on 5 March 1917 and the decision announced in The Times on 26 March. A committee was established, chaired by Mond, to oversee the collection of material to be exhibited in the new museum. [7] [8]\nThis National War Museum Committee set about collecting material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, the production of munitions , and women's war work . [9] There was an early appreciation of the need for exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway , the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must 'be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals'. [10] The museum's first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes , who had previously been curator of the Tower of London armouries. [11] In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and Field Marshal Haig , who reportedly took great interest in his work. [12] In December 1917 the name was changed to the Imperial War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum. [13]\nThe museum was opened by The King at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond addressed the King on the behalf of committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one who took part in the war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice'. [14] Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India , South Africa , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . [15] While the Act was being debated, some Parliamentarians felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War'. [16] On the August Bank Holiday 1920, the first public holiday since the museum's opening, 94,179 visitors were received, [17] while 2,290,719 had visited the museum by November 1921. [18]\n  Relocation 1924–1936\nIn 1924 the museum moved to the Imperial Institute building (demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to make way for Imperial College ) in South Kensington. While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums, the accommodation itself proved cramped and inadequate [19] and in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the River Thames in Southwark.\n  The Imperial Institute, South Kensington, where the museum was located from 1924–1936\nThe building, designed by James Lewis [20] was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital which had been vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by Lord Rothermere , who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely in order to provide a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear'. [21] The 'distinguishing dome' was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital's chapel. [22] The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later King George VI ) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.\n  Second World War and after: 1939–1966\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict. [23] With the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk in May/June 1940, however, the British Army's shortage of equipment saw eighteen of the museum's artillery pieces return to military service. [24] The museum's trench clubs were used by the Home Guard , while other items such as sights and optical instruments were returned to the Ministry of Supply. The museum refused, however, to return some historic items such as a naval gun from HMS Lance (which had fired Britain's first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by Victoria Cross -winning boy seaman Jack Cornwell . [24] The museum initially remained open but was closed for the duration of the war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz . On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Seaplane , which had flown at the Battle of Jutland , was destroyed. [25] While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school. [26] In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department . These included the submarine fuel pipeline PLUTO , the fog dispersal method FIDO , and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier . [27] However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946. [25] [28] A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949. [29] [30]\nIn 1953, with Commonwealth forces engaged in Korea and Malaya the museum began its current policy of collecting material from all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were involved. [25] However, despite this expansion of remit, the early postwar period was a period of decline for the museum. Dr Noble Frankland, the museum's Director from 1960 to 1982, described the museum's galleries in 1955 as appearing 'dingy and neglected [and in a] dismal state of decay' the museum's 'numerous stunning exhibits' notwithstanding. [31]\n  Redevelopment and expansion: 1966–2012\n  15-inch guns outside the museum; the nearer gun from HMS Ramillies , the other from HMS Roberts .\nIn 1966 the Museum's Southwark building was extended to provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since the Museum had moved to the site. The development also included a purpose-built cinema. [32] In 1967 the museum acquired a pair of 15-inch naval guns . One had been mounted on the Royal Navy 's HMS Ramillies and the other on both HMS Resolution and HMS Roberts . Both had been fired in action during the Second World War. They went on permanent display outside the museum in May 1968. [33] The acquisition of these guns, representative of the dreadnought era of British battleships , led the museum to seek to acquire a 6-inch triple turret that would be representative of a number of classes of British cruisers . [34] This would eventually lead to the preservation of the Royal Navy light cruiser HMS Belfast , which became a branch of the museum in 1978. [35]\nLater in 1968 on 13 October the Museum was attacked by an arsonist , Timothy John Daly, who claimed he was acting in protest against the exhibition of militarism to children. He caused damage valued at approximately £200,000, not counting the loss of irreplaceable books and documents. On his conviction in 1969 he was sentenced to four years in prison. [36] [37]\nIn 1969 RAF Duxford, a Royal Air Force fighter airfield in Cambridgeshire was declared surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence . Needing further space, the museum duly requested permission to use part of the site as temporary storage. The entire site was later transferred to the museum in February 1976 and Duxford, now referred to as Imperial War Museum Duxford became the museum's first branch. [38] Also during the 1970s the government raised the possibility of the museum taking over the historic Cabinet War Rooms in Whitehall . The museum was reluctant due to its new commitments related to Duxford and HMS Belfast, but agreed in 1982. [39]\nBy 1983 the museum was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site and approached engineering firm Arup to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building's exhibition space, provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections, and improve facilities for visitors. The following year, in April 1984, the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public as a branch of the museum.\nThe first phase of the works to the Southwark building started in 1986 and were completed in 1989, during which time the museum was closed to the public. The work included the conversion of what was previously the hospital's courtyard into a centrepiece Large Exhibits Gallery. This gallery featured a strengthened ground floor (to support the weight of very heavy exhibits), a first floor mezzanine and second storey viewing balcony. Into this space were placed tanks, artillery pieces, vehicles, ordnance and aircraft from the First World War to the Falklands War . [40] For some years the museum was marketed as 'The new Imperial War Museum'. [41] This atrium, with its concentration of military hardware, has been described as 'the biggest boys' bedroom in London'. [42] This first phase cost £16.7 million (of which £12 million was provided by the government) and the museum was reopened by The Queen on 29 June 1989. [43]\n  Panorama of the atrium. Ground floor exhibits include: 'Devil' a Mark V tank ; 'Ole Bill' an LGOC B-type bus, V-2 and Polaris missiles, 800 mm shell from Schwerer Gustav , and (sand-coloured, extreme right) a Grant tank used by Bernard Montgomery . Suspended aircraft include a Sopwith Camel , Heinkel He 162 and (partially obscured) Supermarine Spitfire number R/6915, which flew in the Battle of Britain and shot down three aircraft. [44]\nIn September 1992 the museum was the target of a Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions. Two incendiary devices were found in a basement gallery, but were extinguished by staff before the arrival of the fire brigade , and caused only minor damage. [45] [46]\nThe second stage of the redevelopment of the Southwark building, during which the museum remained open to the public, was completed in 1994. [40] During the 1990s, while these works were going on, the museum was also seeking to open a branch in the north of England. Seventy-one sites were offered for consideration by 36 local councils and in January 1999 the then Culture Secretary Chris Smith formally launched a project to construct a new branch of the museum, Imperial War Museum North , in Trafford , Greater Manchester . [47]\nThe following year, 2000, the final phase of the Southwark redevelopment was completed. The development included the installation of the museum's Holocaust Exhibition which was opened by the Queen on 6 June 2000. This was the first permanent exhibition dedicated to the Holocaust in a UK museum, and had taken five years at a cost of £5 million. [48] Two years later, in July 2002, Imperial War Museum North was opened.\nBetween 2004-2010 the museum was a partner in a national learning project entitled 'Their Past Your Future' (TPYF), part of the Big Lottery Fund 's Veterans Reunited programme to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. [49] A partnership between the IWM, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council , and Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh museum authorities, phase one included a touring exhibition seen by more than two million people, [50] overseas educational visits [51] and further activities run by local authorities. A second phase took a wider 20th century historical remit; it comprised a learning programme using overseas visits and social media , and a professional development scheme for educators. [52] A digital archive of the project, [53] online exhibitions and learning resources were also produced. [54]\nIn October 2011 the museum rebranded itself as Imperial War Museums, the acronym IWM forming the basis of a new corporate logo. [55]\nIn September 2011 the museum secured funding from NESTA , the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Arts Council England to develop 'social interpretation' systems to allow visitors to comment on, collect, and share museum objects via social media. [56] These systems were incorporated in 'A Family in Wartime' an exhibition at IWM London depicting British family life during the Second World War, which opened in April 2012. [57]\n  First World War centenary: 2014\nIn August 2009 the Museum announced the creation of the Imperial War Museum Foundation. Chaired by Jonathon Harmsworth the foundation is charged with raising funds to support the redevelopment of Imperial War Museum London's permanent galleries. [58] In December 2010 plans were announced to redevelop IWM London's First World War gallery in time for the conflict's centenary in 2014, [59] and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge became the foundation's patron. [60] The redevelopment is intended to provide new gallery spaces and a new central hall, easier navigation and improved visitor facilities. The redevelopment will entail disruptive works in gallery spaces during autumn 2012, and a six-month closure of IWM London from January 2013. [61]\n  Branches\nFrom the 1970s onwards the Imperial War Museum began to expand onto other sites. The first branch, Imperial War Museum Duxford opened to the public on a regular basis in June 1976. [62] HMS Belfast became a branch of the museum in 1978. [63] The Cabinet War Rooms opened in 1984, and Imperial War Museum North in 2002.\n  Imperial War Museum London\n  A view of Bethlem Royal Hospital in 1828\nThe museum has occupied the former Bethlem Royal Hospital on Lambeth Road since 1936. The hospital building was designed by the hospital surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by John Gandy and other architects, and construction completed in October 1814. The hospital consisted of a range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to Lambeth Road , with a central entrance under a portico . [64]\nThe building was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke . In order to provide more space, he added blocks at either end of the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site. [64]\nThe building remained substantially unchanged until vacated by the hospital in 1930. After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere , the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 the ground floor of the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to William Orpen and John Lavery ), a gallery on women's war work , and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings. [65] This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II listed building status. [66]\nThe original hospital building is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000 m2 of gallery space of which 4,600 m2 was new, and the second provided a further 1,600 m2. [40] The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund [67] and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. [68] The basement is occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts since 1945. The ground floor comprises the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor provides the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces , espionage and covert operations . The second floor features the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor houses the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor, a vaulted roof space, houses the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft , 241 medals in total. [40] [69] [70]\n  All Saints Annexe\n  Tibetan Peace Garden with the museum behind\nIn 1986 the museum acquired the All Saints Annexe, a former hospital building in Austral Street off West Square . The 1867 building, which backs onto Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, was originally an orphanage opened by local philanthropist Charlotte Sharman , then later used as a hospital. It houses the museum's photographic, film and sound archives, and offices. [71] [72]\n  Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park\n1999 saw the use of the surrounding park for purposes of commemoration or the promotion of peace. In 1999 a Soviet War Memorial was unveiled by the then Secretary of State for Defence George Robertson , and the Russian ambassador Yuri Fokine. [73] The date of the unveiling (9 May) was significant as that day is marked as Victory Day in Russia. Also in May 1999 the Dalai Lama opened a Tibetan Peace Garden, commissioned by the Tibet Foundation, in the park. The garden features a bronze cast of the Kalachakra Mandala, contemporary western sculpture, and a pillar inscribed with a message from the Dalai Lama in English, Tibetan , Hindi and Chinese . [74]\n  Imperial War Museum Duxford\n  AirSpace at IWM Duxford .\nImperial War Museum Duxford, near the village of Duxford in Cambridgeshire , is Britain's largest aviation museum . [75] Duxford houses the museum's large exhibits, including nearly 200 aircraft , military vehicles, artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibitions buildings. [76] The site also provides storage space for the museum's collections of film, photographs, documents, books and artefacts. The site accommodates a number of British Army regimental museums, including those of the Parachute Regiment and the Royal Anglian Regiment .\nBased on the historic Duxford Aerodrome , the site was originally operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the First World War . During the Second World War Duxford played a prominent role during the Battle of Britain and was later used by United States Army Air Forces fighter units in support of the daylight bombing of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. Many of Duxford's original buildings, such as hangars used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. A number of these buildings are of architectural or historic significance and over thirty have listed building status. [77] The site also features a number of purpose-built exhibition buildings, such as the Stirling Prize -winning American Air Museum, designed by Sir Norman Foster . The site remains an active airfield and is used by a number of civilian flying companies, and hosts regular air shows . The site is operated in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society, a charity formed in 1975 to preserve civil aircraft and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history.\n  HMS Belfast\nMain article: HMS Belfast (C35)\n  HMS Belfast at her berth in the Pool of London\nHMS Belfast, a Town class cruiser , was launched in 1938 and served throughout the Second World War , participating in the December 1943 Battle of North Cape and firing some of the first shots of Operation Overlord , the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. She saw further combat in the Korean War . Expected to be disposed of as scrap after she was decommissioned in 1963, in 1967 efforts were initiated to preserve Belfast as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence was established, and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971 the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS Belfast Trust to campaign for her to be saved for the nation. The Trust was successful in its efforts, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London . Opened to the public in October 1971 Belfast became a branch of the Imperial War Museum on 1 March 1978, being acknowledged by the then Secretary of State for Education and Science , Shirley Williams , as 'a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology'. [78] In service for 24 years HMS Belfast was in Frankland's opinion, capable of representing 'a whole generation of [historical evidence]'. [79]\n  Churchill War Rooms\n  The Map Room of the Cabinet War Rooms\nThe Cabinet War Rooms is an underground complex that served as a British government command centre throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster , the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan . Their historical value was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30–40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted. [39] The museum agreed to take over the administration of the site in 1982, [39] a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill . Thatcher opened the War Rooms in April 1984. In 2003 a further suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. [80] In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850 m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The development of the Churchill Museum cost a further £6 million. The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre , via an 'electronic filing cabinet'. [81] The museum was renamed the Churchill War Rooms in 2010.\n  Imperial War Museum North\n  Entrance of Imperial War Museum North in Manchester\nThe Imperial War Museum North was opened in Trafford , Greater Manchester in 2002. It was the first branch of the museum outside southeast England, and the first to be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind , Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind’s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays , was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. [82] Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings , a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5 million. [83] [84]\nThe museum's first floor main gallery space houses the permanent exhibitions. These consist of a chronological display which runs around the gallery's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in 'silos' within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture. The main gallery, described as cavernous and dramatic, [85] [86] includes objects such as a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jet, and a British 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army 's first shot of the First World War. [87] The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery. [88]\n  Collections\nSee also category: Collection of the Imperial War Museum\n  The museum's collection includes this photograph of Montgomery in his tank along with the tank itself, his command caravans and staff car, [89] and his papers. [90] [91]\nThe Imperial War Museum's original collections date back to the material amassed by the National War Museum Committee. The present departmental organisation came into being during the 1960s as part of Frankland's reorganisation of the museum. The 1970s saw oral history gain increasing prominence and in 1972 the museum created the Department of Sound Records (now the Sound Archive) to record interviews with individuals who had experienced the First World War. Since the opening of the Holocaust and Crimes against Humanity exhibitions, a collecting department has been established to support them. The museum maintains an online database of its collections . [92]\n  Departments\nThere are eight departments responsible for different aspects of the museum's collections.\nThe Department of Documents holds private papers such as letters and diaries from both individual soldiers and civilians to high-ranking officers such as Field Marshals Bernard Montgomery , [91] Sir John French [93] and Henry Hughes Wilson . Also of note are manuscripts by war poets Isaac Rosenberg and Siegfried Sassoon . The Department holds the official British records of the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunals and a variety of other official records. The Department also houses the UK National Inventory of War Memorials .\nThe Art department holds much of the work of official war artists from both world wars, and contemporary art from after 1945. As early as 1920 the art collection held over 3,000 works [94] and included pieces by John Singer Sargent , Wyndham Lewis , John Nash and Christopher Nevinson . The collection expanded again after the Second World War, holding around 70% of the 6,000 works produced by the Ministry of Information's War Artists Advisory Committee. [95] In 1972 the museum's Artistic Records Committee was established to commission artists to cover contemporary conflicts. [96] [97] The collection also includes a large number of propaganda posters from many countries and periods. Several thousand of the museum's posters are available digitally via the Visual Arts Data Service (VADS) in two collections; the Spanish Civil War Poster Collection and the Posters of Conflict collection. VADS also hosts the museum's Concise Art Collection. [98] [99] [100] Seventy-eight works from the museum's collection are represented on the Google Art Project . [101]\nThe Film and Video Archive is one of the oldest film archives in the world [102] [103] [104] and preserves a range of historically significant film and video material. The collection includes the official British film record of the First World War and the 1916 feature film The Battle of the Somme , which is inscribed on UNESCO 's Memory of the World register. The collection also includes the official British film record of the Second World War, amateur film and film of other conflicts since 1945. [105] Material from the collection was used to make a number of well-known TV documentary series including The Great War and The World at War .\nThe Photograph Archive preserves the official British photographic record of both World Wars and conflicts since 1945. It currently holds more than 6,000,000 images and the Second World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Bill Brandt , Cecil Beaton [106] and Bert Hardy . Both the Film and Photograph Archives are official repositories for material produced by the Ministry of Defence and so include material from contemporary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nThe Department of Exhibits and Firearms is responsible for the care of the Museum's collection of three-dimensional objects. The cores of the collection are the firearms collection, collections of artillery, ordnance and vehicles, and medals and decorations such as the Victoria Cross and George Cross . Some of the department's larger exhibits can be seen in the photograph of the atrium above. Other exhibits include artillery pieces whose crew won the Victoria Cross, a Lee Enfield rifle used by T. E. Lawrence , and a Colt 1911 automatic pistol owned by Winston Churchill . [107]\n  A still from The Battle of the Somme, kept in the Film and Video Archive\nThe Department of Printed Books is responsible for the Museum’s collection of printed materials including books, maps and ephemera. When the Museum was established the distinguished historian Sir Charles Oman was given responsibility for the library. [108] In 1922 the library collection contained a reported 20,000 items [109] and 60,000 items in 1953. [28] In 2010-11 the Museum reported the size of its library collection as 342,000 items. [110]\nThe Sound Archive, originally named the Department of Sound Records, administers a collection of over 56,000 hours of historical recordings and was opened to the public in July 1977. [111] The core of this collection are oral history interviews with people who were affected by war in the 20th century. This collection has been used for a series of radio programmes and books, called Forgotten Voices , about war in the 20th century. The collection also includes historic broadcasts, and actuality sound effects recorded during conflicts.\nThe Department of Holocaust and Genocide History supports the Holocaust and Crimes against Humanity exhibitions. The department seeks to acquire archival material and artefacts to illustrate its subject; notable acquisitions include the Gianfranco Moscati collection which documents the persecution of the Jews during the Second World War. [112] The department also answers public and academic enquiries, advises other bodies working on related subjects, represents the museum at relevant events and supports the museums' educational activities. [113] It also occasionally undertakes external consultancy, for instance assisting with the establishment of a memorial room at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina . [114]\n  Governance\nThe Imperial War Museum is an executive non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport , from which it receives financial support in the form of a grant-in-aid . The governance of the museum is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, originally established by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920, [15] later amended by the Imperial War Museum Act 1955 [115] and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 and other relevant legislation. The board comprises a president (currently Prince Edward, Duke of Kent ) who is appointed by the sovereign, and fourteen members appointed in varying proportions by the Prime Minister , and the Foreign , Defence , and Culture Secretaries . Seven further members are Commonwealth High Commissioners appointed ex officio by their respective governments. As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards and his deputy is Lieutenant-General Sir John Kiszely . [116] [117] [118] Past chairmen have included Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin (1967–77), [119] Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon Willis [120] and Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Grandy (trustee 1971–78, Chairman 1978–89). During the Second World War Grandy had commanded RAF Duxford, and was Chairman during the planning of Duxford's American Air Museum , which opened in 1997. [121] [122]\nThe museum's Director-General is answerable to the trustees and acts as accounting officer. Since 1917 the museum has had six directors. The first was Sir Martin Conway , a noted art historian, mountaineer and explorer. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts to map the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas , and was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of Director until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley. Bradley had served in the First World War in the Middlesex Regiment before being invalided out in 1917. He later became acquainted with Charles ffoulkes, who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum's poster collection. [123] Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr Noble Frankland . Frankland had served as a navigator in RAF Bomber Command , winning a Distinguished Flying Cross . While a Cabinet Office official historian he co-authored a controversial official history of the RAF strategic air campaign against Germany. Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr Alan Borg who had previously been at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts . In 1995 Borg moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum and was succeeded by Sir Robert Crawford , who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968. Upon Crawford's retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by Diane Lees, previously Director of the V&A Museum of Childhood . She was noted in the media as the first woman appointed to lead a British national museum . [124]\n  See also\nImperial War Museum Stamp Collection\n  References",

The museum was founded during the First World War in 1917 and intended as a record of the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and her Empire . Today the museum gives its mission as 'to enable people to have an informed understanding of modern war and its impact on individuals and society' [6] .\nOriginally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill , the museum opened to the public in 1920. In 1924 the museum moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington , and finally in 1936 the museum acquired a permanent home which was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark. The outbreak of the Second World War saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference, but the post-war period saw the museum enter a period of decline. The 1960s saw the museum redevelop its Southwark building, now referred to as Imperial War Museum London, and which serves as the organisation's corporate headquarters . During the 1970s the museum began to expand onto other sites. The first, in 1976, was a historic airfield in Cambridgeshire now referred to as Imperial War Museum Duxford . In 1978 the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Belfast became a branch of the museum, having previously been preserved for the nation by a private trust. In 1984 the Cabinet War Rooms , an underground wartime command centre, was opened to the public. From the 1980s onwards the museum's Bethlem building underwent a series of multimillion-pound redevelopments, completed in 2000. Finally, 2002 saw the opening of Imperial War Museum North in Trafford , Greater Manchester , the fifth branch of the museum and the first in the north of England.\nThe museum's collections include archives of personal and official documents, photographs , film and video material, and oral history recordings; an extensive library , a large art collection, and examples of military vehicles and aircraft, equipment and other artefacts. The museum is funded by government grants, charitable donations and revenue generation through commercial activity such as retailing, licensing, and publishing. Admission is free to Imperial War Museum London and Imperial War Museum North, but an admission fee is levied at the other branches. The museum is an exempt charity under the Charities Act 1993 and a non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport . The current Chairman of the Trustees is Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Squire . Since October 2008, the museum's Director General has been Diane Lees.\nContents\nEstablishment\nSir Alfred Mond, photographed between 1910 and 1920.\nOn 27 February 1917 Sir Alfred Mond , an MP and First Commissioner of Works, wrote to the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to propose the establishment of a National War Museum. This proposal was accepted by the War Cabinet on 5 March 1917 and the decision announced in The Times on 26 March. A committee was established, chaired by Mond, to oversee the collection of material to be exhibited in the new museum. [7] [8]\nThis National War Museum Committee set about collecting material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, the production of munitions , and women's war work . [9] There was an early appreciation of the need for exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway , the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must \"be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals\". [10] The museum's first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes, who had previously been curator of the Tower of London armouries. [11] In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and Field Marshal Haig , who reportedly took great interest in his work. [12] In December 1917 the name was changed to the Imperial War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum. [13]\nThe museum was opened by the King at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond addressed the King on the behalf of committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one who took part in the war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice' . [14] Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India , South Africa , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . [15] While the Act was being debated, some Parliamentarians felt that that museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War' . [16] By November 1921 the museum had received 2,290,719 visitors. [17]\nRelocation\nIn 1924 the museum moved to the Imperial Institute building (demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to make way for Imperial College ) in South Kensington. While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums, the accommodation itself proved cramped and inadequate [18] and in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the River Thames in Southwark.\nThe Imperial Institute, South Kensington, where the museum was located from 1924 - 1936\nThe building, designed by James Lewis [19] was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital which had been vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by Lord Rothermere , who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely in order to provide a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear' . [20] The 'distinguishing dome' was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital's chapel, [21] and is now the museum's reading room. The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later King George VI ) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict. [22] The museum initially remained open but was closed for the duration of the war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz . On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Seaplane , which had flown at the Battle of Jutland , was destroyed. [23] While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school. [24] In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department. These included the submarine fuel pipeline PLUTO , the fog dispersal method FIDO , and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier . [25] However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946. [23] [26] A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949. [27] [28]\nIn 1953, with Commonwealth forces engaged in Korea and Malaya the museum began its current policy of collecting material from all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were involved. [23] However, despite this expansion of remit, the early postwar period was a period of decline for the museum. Dr Noble Frankland, the museum's Director from 1960 to 1982, described the museum's galleries in 1955 as appearing 'dingy and neglected' and in a 'dismal state of decay' the museum's 'numerous stunning exhibits' notwithstanding. [29]\nRedevelopment\nThe museum building showing the dome, guns, and the absence of the wings.\nIn 1966 the Museum's Southwark building was extended to provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since the Museum had moved to the site. The development also included a purpose-built cinema. [30] Two years later in 1968 a pair of 15-inch naval guns were installed in front of the Museum. Both had previously been mounted in Royal Navy warships (one from HMS Ramillies and the other mounted on HMS Resolution and later HMS Roberts ) and had been fired in action during the Second World War. [31]\nLater that year on 13 October the Museum was attacked by an arsonist , Timothy John Daly, who claimed he was acting in protest against the exhibition of militarism to children. He caused damage valued at approximately £200,000, not counting the loss of irreplaceable books and documents. On his conviction in 1969 he was sentenced to four years in prison. [32] [33]\nBy 1983 the museum was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site and approached engineering firm Arup to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building's exhibition space, provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections, and improve facilities for visitors. The first phase of these works, started in 1986, created 8,000m2 of gallery space of which 4,6002 was new, [34] and saw the conversion of what was previously the hospital's courtyard into a centrepiece Large Exhibits Gallery. This gallery featured a strengthened ground floor (to support the weight of very heavy exhibits), a first floor mezzanine and second storey viewing balcony. Into this space were placed tanks, artillery pieces, vehicles, ordnance and aircraft from the First World War to the Falklands War , and for some years the museum was marketed as 'The new Imperial War Museum'. [35] This atrium, with its concentration of military hardware, has been described as 'the biggest boys' bedroom in London'. [36] This first phase cost £16.7 million (of which £12 million was provided by the government) and was opened by the Queen on 29 June 1989. [37]\nPanorama of the atrium. Ground floor exhibits include: 'Devil' a Mark V tank ; 'Ole Bill' an LGOC B-type bus, V-2 and Polaris missiles, and (sand-coloured, extreme right) a Grant tank used by Bernard Montgomery . Suspended aircraft include a Sopwith Camel , Heinkel He 162 and (partially obscured) a Supermarine Spitfire which flew in the Battle of Britain .\nIn September 1992 the museum was the target of a Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions. Two incendiary devices were found in a basement gallery, but were extinguished by staff before the arrival of the fire brigade , and caused only minor damage. [38] [39]\nA second stage of redevelopment, providing a further 1,600m2 of floor space was completed in 1994 [34] and a third stage in 2000. The latter expansion, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund [40] and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors [41] The development included the installation of the museum's Holocaust Exhibition which was opened by the Queen on 6 June 2000. This was the first permanent exhibition dedicated to the Holocaust in a UK museum, and had taken five years at a cost of £5 million. [42]\nTibetan Peace Garden with the museum behind\nThis period also saw the use of the surrounding park for purposes of commemoration or the promotion of peace. In 1999 a Soviet War Memorial was unveiled by the then Secretary of State for Defence George Robertson , and the Russian ambassador Yuri Fokine. [43] The date of the unveiling (9 May) was significant as that day is marked as Victory Day in Russia. Also in May 1999 the Dalai Lama opened a Tibetan Peace Garden, commissioned by the Tibet Foundation, in the park. The garden features a bronze cast of the Kalachakra Mandala, contemporary western sculpture, and a pillar inscribed with a message from the Dalai Lama in English, Tibetan , Hindi and Chinese . [44]\nIn August 2009 the museum announced the creation of the Imperial War Museum Foundation. Chaired by Jonathan Harmsworth , the great-grandson of the 1st Viscount who had secured the museum's Bethlem building, the foundation is charged with raising funds to support the refurbishment of the museum's permanent galleries. At the time of the announcement, the museum was planning for the refurbishment of its First World War gallery by 2014, the centenary of the outbreak of the war, and for the refurbishment of its Second World War and Post-1945 galleries by 2020, the museum's own centenary. [45]\nBranches\nFrom the 1970s onwards the museum began to expand onto other sites. The first of these sites, a former RAF and United States Army Air Force airfield at Duxford in Cambridgeshire , was opened to the public on a regular basis in June 1976. [46] HMS Belfast , a light cruiser moored in the Pool of London , has been under the care of the museum since 1978. [47]\nImperial War Museum Duxford\nAirSpace at IWM Duxford .\nThe Duxford branch of the Imperial War Museum houses its large exhibits, including the aircraft and military and naval vehicles collection. The museum has seven main exhibition buildings with nearly 200 military and civil aircraft. A historic airfield, used for military flying since 1916; the last operational flight at Duxford was made in July 1961. The museum originally only used one of the site's hangars as temporary storage for part of its aircraft collection; however, following a series of popular air displays from 1973 onwards, the museum acquired the entire site for its use in February 1976. [48] [49]\nThe aircraft collection includes types such as a British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2 and the only SR-71 Blackbird on display outside the United States of America. The military vehicle collection includes command caravans used by Field Marshal Montgomery . [50] The naval collection includes an example of an X-craft midget submarine [51] and the Vosper motor torpedo boat MTB-71. [52] [53] The site provides accommodation for a number of regimental museums (including those of the Parachute Regiment , named Airborne Assault , [54] and the Royal Anglian Regiment ), and also provides additional collections storage. The site remains an active airfield and hosts regular air displays.\nHMS Belfast\nMain article: HMS Belfast (C35)\nCare of the light cruiser HMS Belfast, which had served throughout the Second World War , was transferred to the museum on 1 March 1978 after Shirley Williams , the then Secretary of State for Education and Science , accepted that the ship was \"a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology\". [55]\nHMS Belfast at her berth in the Pool of London\nShe had been preserved for the nation since 1971 in the Pool of London under the care of a private charitable trust, the HMS Belfast Trust; the first such preservation of a naval ship since HMS Victory . [56] The museum, along with the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence , had been involved in an earlier plan, which took place in the late 1960s, to preserve the ship, which the government on that occasion had declined in 1971. [47]\nHMS Belfast was a notable vessel. Launched in March 1938 she served throughout the Second World War, participating in the Battle of North Cape and firing some of the first shots of Operation Overlord . She later served in the Korean War. The ship left Singapore on 26 March 1962 for the UK where she made a final visit to Belfast and after an exercise in the Mediterranean was paid off on 24 August 1963. In service for 24 years HMS Belfast was, in the view of historian Noble Frankland , capable of representing \"a whole generation of [historical evidence]\". [57]\nChurchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms\nThe Map Room of the Cabinet War Rooms\nIn 1984 the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public as a branch of the museum. The War Rooms are an underground complex that had been used as a command centre by the British government throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster , the facilities were constructed before the war in anticipation of extremely destructive aerial bombing of London. They became operational in 1939 and were in constant operation for the duration of the war. The complex was abandoned in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan . The historical value of the Rooms was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit the War Rooms by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30-40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted. [58] During the 1970s the Cabinet Office and the Department for the Environment , which was responsible for the Rooms after 1975, raised the possibility of the museum taking over the War Rooms. The museum was reluctant due to its new commitments related to Duxford and HMS Belfast, but agreed in 1982. [58] The scheme was keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , and she opened the War Rooms in April 1984.\nFollowing a major expansion in 2003 a suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. [59] In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The museum, the development of which cost a further £6 milion raised from private fundraising, makes extensive use of audiovisual technology. The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre , via an 'electronic filing cabinet'. [60]\nImperial War Museum North\nEntrance of Imperial War Museum North in Manchester\nThe Imperial War Museum North was opened in Trafford , Greater Manchester in 2002, the first branch of the museum outside of southeast England. [61] The museum's first floor main gallery space houses the permanent exhibitions. These consist of a chronological display which runs around the gallery's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in 'silos' within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture. Though exhibiting fewer large objects than other museum branches, Imperial War Museum North features in its main gallery a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jet, and a British 18-pounder field gun which fired the British Army 's first shot of the First World War. [62] The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery. [63]\nThe project to construct a branch of the museum in the north of England, was launched in January 1999 by the then Culture Secretary Chris Smith . The new building was the first of the branches to be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind , it was his first building in Britain. Libeskind’s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays , was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. [64] Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings , a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5 million. [65] [66]\nThe London building\nA view of Bethlem Royal Hospital in 1828\nThe Imperial War Museum has had three homes. Originally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill , in 1920, the museum moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington during 1924, and finally in 1936 the museum acquired a permanent home in the former Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark. The hospital building was designed by the hospital surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by John Gandy and other architects, [67] and construction completed in October 1814. [68] The hospital consisted of a range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to Lambeth Road , with a central entrance under a portico . [67]\nThe building was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke . In order to provide more space, he added blocks at either end of the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844-46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site. [68]\nThe building remained substantially unchanged until vacated by the hospital in 1930. After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere , the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 the ground floor of the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to William Orpen and John Lavery ), a gallery on women's war work , and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings. [69] This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards.\nThe original hospital building is now largely occupied by corporate offices. A 1966 extension? houses the library, art store, and document archives.Redevelopments in the 1980s created exhibition space over five floors, along with the acquisition of the All Saints Annexe, a former hospital building in Austral Street off West Square . The 1867 building, which backs onto Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, was originally an orphanage opened by local philanthropist Charlotte Sharman , then later used as a hospital. It houses the museum's photographic, film and sound archives, and offices. [70]\nCollections\nThe collections include this photograph [71] of Montgomery in his command tank, the tank itself, as well as Montgomery's papers and command caravan from the European campaign. [72]\nThe Imperial War Museum's original collections date back to the material amassed by the National War Museum Committee. The present departmental organisation came into being during the 1960s as part of Frankland's reorganisation of the museum. The 1970s saw oral history gain increasing prominence and in 1972 the museum created the Department of Sound Records (now the Sound Archive) to record interviews with individuals who had experienced the First World War. Since the opening of the Holocaust and Crimes against Humanity exhibitions, a collecting department has been established to support them. The museum maintains an online database of its collections named Collections Online . [73]\nMaterial from the collections are displayed at each of the museum's branches, and on five levels at the Lambeth Road site. The basement is occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts since 1945. The ground floor comprises the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, the permanent Children's War exhibition (extending into the basement), and visitor facilities. The first floor provides the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces , espionage and covert operations . The second floor features the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor houses the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor provides a further exhibition area in the vaulted roof space. From November 2010 this area will accommodate the Lord Ashcroft Gallery, exhibiting the museum's own collection of Victoria and George Crosses , and the private collection of Victoria Crosses amassed by Michael Ashcroft . [74] [75]\nDepartments\nThere are eight departments responsible for different aspects of the museum's collections.\nThe Department of Documents holds private papers such as letters and diaries from both individual soldiers and civilians to high-ranking officers such as Field Marshals Bernard Montgomery , [76] Sir John French [77] and Henry Maitland Wilson . Also of note are manuscripts by war poets Isaac Rosenberg and Siegfried Sassoon . The Department holds the official British records of the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunals and a variety of other official records. The Department also houses the UK National Inventory of War Memorials .\nThe Art department holds much of the work of official war artists from both world wars, and contemporary art from after 1945. As early as 1920 the art collection held over 3,000 works [78] and included pieces by John Singer Sargent , Wyndham Lewis , John Nash and Christopher Nevinson . The collection expanded again after the Second World War, holding around 70% of the 6,000 works produced by the Ministry of Information's War Artists Advisory Committee. [79] The collection also includes a large number of propaganda posters from many countries and periods. [a] In 1972 the museum's Artistic Records Committee was established to commission artists to cover contemporary conflicts. [80] [81]\nThe Film and Video Archive is one of the oldest film archives in Britain [82] and preserves a range of historically significant film and video material. The collection includes the official British film record of the First World War and the 1916 feature film The Battle of the Somme , which is inscribed on UNESCO 's Memory of the World register. The collection also includes the official British film record of the Second World War, amateur film and film of other conflicts since 1945. [83] Material from the collection was used to make a number of well-known TV documentary series including The Great War and The World at War .\nThe Photograph Archive preserves the official British photographic record of both World Wars and conflicts since 1945. It currently holds more than 6,000,000 images and the Second World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Bill Brandt , Cecil Beaton [84] and Bert Hardy . Both the Film and Photograph Archives are official repositories for material produced by the Ministry of Defence and so include material from contemporary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nThe Department of Exhibits and Firearms is responsible for the care of the Museum's collection of three-dimensional objects. The cores of the collection are the firearms collection, collections of artillery, ordnance and vehicles, and medals and decorations such as the Victoria Cross and George Cross . Many of the department's larger exhibits are on display and can be seen in the photographs below . Other exhibits include artillery pieces whose crew won the Victoria Cross, [85] a Lee Enfield rifle used by T. E. Lawrence , [86] and a Colt 1911 automatic pistol owned by Winston Churchill .\nA still from The Battle of the Somme, kept in the Film and Video Archive\nThe Department of Printed Books is responsible for the Museum’s collection of printed materials including books, maps and ephemera. When the Museum was established the distinguished historian Sir Charles Oman was given responsibility for the library. [87] In 1922 the library collection contained a reported 20,000 items [88] and 60,000 items in 1953. [89] Today the Museum gives the size of its library collection as 270,000 items. [90]\nThe Sound Archive, originally named the Department of Sound Records, administers a collection of over 56,000 hours of historical recordings and was opened to the public in July 1977. [91] The core of this collection are oral history interviews with people who were affected by war in the 20th century. This collection has been used for a series of radio programmes and books, called Forgotten Voices , about war in the 20th century. The collection also includes historic broadcasts, and actuality sound effects recorded during conflicts.\nThe Department of Holocaust and Genocide History supports the Holocaust and Crimes against Humanity exhibitions. The department seeks to acquire archival material and artefacts to illustrate its subject; notable acquisitions include the Gianfranco Moscati collection which documents the persecution of the Jews during the Second World War. [92] The department also answers public and academic enquiries, advises other bodies working on related subjects, represents the museum at relevant events and supports the museums' educational activities. [93] It also occasionally undertakes external consultancy, for instance assisting with the establishment of a memorial room at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina . [94]\nDirectors\nSince 1917 the museum has had six directors. The first was Sir Martin Conway , a noted art historian, mountaineer and explorer. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts to map the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas , and was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of Director until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley.

I think Bromley Council  should be making this point very strongly to any developer.\n‘Privately  Bromley Council still harbours an aspiration to see a major development  on the top of the park so the park does always seem to be somewhat  under threat.

This  lead to the formation of Girl Guides and later, Girl Scouts.\n1911: The Festival of Empire was held to mark the coronation of George V and Queen Mary.\nFollowing the festival, the burden of maintenance costs became too large and bankruptcy was declared.\n1913: The Earl of Plymouth purchased Crystal Palace to save it from  developers. It was later bought by a public subscription for the nation.\n1914-1918: The building was used as a naval training establishment under the name of HMS Victory VI, or HMS Crystal Palace.\n1918: Reopened as the first Imperial War Museum, but it was unpopular.\n1920s: A board of trustees under Sir Henry Buckland set about restoring the building and making it profitable again.\nOctober 1934: The Pageant of Labour, a musical celebration of the British Labour Movement, was held at Crystal Palace.\nSmoke and ashes: The flames from the blaze in south-east London could be seen from eight counties\nDestruction: The Crystal Palace in the aftermath of the 1936 fire, witnessed by tens of thousands of people\n30 November 1936: Crystal Palace destroyed by fire.

George to propose the establishment of a National War Museum. This proposal was accepted by the War Cabinet on 5 March 1917 and the decision announced in The Times on 26 March. A committee was established, chaired by Mond, to oversee the collection of material to be exhibited in the new museum.\nThis National War Museum Committee set about collecting material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, the production of munitions, and women's war work. There was an early appreciation of the need for exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway, the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must \"be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals\". The museum's first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes, who had previously been curator of the Tower of London armouries. In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and Field Marshal Haig, who reportedly took great interest in his work. In December 1917 the name was changed to the Imperial War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum.\nThe museum was opened by the King at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond addressed the King on the behalf of committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one who took part in the war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice' . Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India, South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. While the Act was being debated, some Parliamentarians felt that that museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War' . By November 1921 the museum had received 2,290,719 visitors.\nRelocation\nIn 1924 the museum moved to the Imperial Institute building (demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to make way for Imperial College) in South Kensington. While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums, the accommodation itself proved cramped and inadequate and in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the River Thames in Southwark.\nThe Imperial Institute, South Kensington, where the museum was located from 1924 - 1936\nThe building, designed by James Lewis was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital which had been vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by Lord Rothermere, who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely in order to provide a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear' . The 'distinguishing dome' was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital's chapel, and is now the museum's reading room. The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later King George VI) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict. The museum initially remained open but was closed for the duration of the war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz. On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Seaplane, which had flown at the Battle of Jutland, was destroyed. While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school. In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department. These included the submarine fuel pipeline PLUTO, the fog dispersal method FIDO, and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier. However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946. A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949.\nIn 1953, with Commonwealth forces engaged in Korea and Malaya the museum began its current policy of collecting material from all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were involved. However, despite this expansion of remit, the early postwar period was a period of decline for the museum. Dr Noble Frankland, the museum's Director from 1960 to 1982, described the museum's galleries in 1955 as appearing 'dingy and neglected' and in a 'dismal state of decay' the museum's 'numerous stunning exhibits' notwithstanding.\nRedevelopment\nThe museum building showing the dome, guns, and the absence of the wings.\nIn 1966 the Museum's Southwark building was extended to provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since the Museum had moved to the site. The development also included a purpose-built cinema. Two years later in 1968 a pair of 15-inch naval guns were installed in front of the Museum. Both had previously been mounted in Royal Navy warships (one from HMS Ramillies and the other mounted on HMS Resolution and later HMS Roberts) and had been fired in action during the Second World War.\nLater that year on 13 October the Museum was attacked by an arsonist, Timothy John Daly, who claimed he was acting in protest against the exhibition of militarism to children. He caused damage valued at approximately 200,000, not counting the loss of irreplaceable books and documents. On his conviction in 1969 he was sentenced to four years in prison.\nBy 1983 the museum was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site and approached engineering firm Arup to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building's exhibition space, provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections, and improve facilities for visitors. The first phase of these works, started in 1986, created 8,000m2 of gallery space of which 4,6002 was new, and saw the conversion of what was previously the hospital's courtyard into a centrepiece Large Exhibits Gallery. This gallery featured a strengthened ground floor (to support the weight of very heavy exhibits), a first floor mezzanine and second storey viewing balcony. Into this space were placed tanks, artillery pieces, vehicles, ordnance and aircraft from the First World War to the Falklands War, and for some years the museum was marketed as 'The new Imperial War Museum'. This atrium, with its concentration of military hardware, has been described as 'the biggest boys' bedroom in London'. This first phase cost 16.7 million (of which 12 million was provided by the government) and was opened by the Queen on 29 June 1989.\nPanorama of the atrium. Ground floor exhibits include: 'Devil' a Mark V tank; 'Ole Bill' an LGOC B-type bus, V-2 and Polaris missiles, and (sand-coloured, extreme right) a Grant tank used by Bernard Montgomery. Suspended aircraft include a Sopwith Camel, Heinkel He 162 and (partially obscured) a Supermarine Spitfire which flew in the Battle of Britain.\nIn September 1992 the museum was the target of a Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions. Two incendiary devices were found in a basement gallery, but were extinguished by staff before the arrival of the fire brigade, and caused only minor damage.\nA second stage of redevelopment, providing a further 1,600m2 of floor space was completed in 1994 and a third stage in 2000. The latter expansion, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a 12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors The development included the installation of the museum's Holocaust Exhibition which was opened by the Queen on 6 June 2000. This was the first permanent exhibition dedicated to the Holocaust in a UK museum, and had taken five years at a cost of 5 million.\nTibetan Peace Garden with the museum behind\nThis period also saw the use of the surrounding park for purposes of commemoration or the promotion of peace. In 1999 a Soviet War Memorial was unveiled by the then Secretary of State for Defence George Robertson, and the Russian ambassador Yuri Fokine. The date of the unveiling (9 May) was significant as that day is marked as Victory Day in Russia. Also in May 1999 the Dalai Lama opened a Tibetan Peace Garden, commissioned by the Tibet Foundation, in the park. The garden features a bronze cast of the Kalachakra Mandala, contemporary western sculpture, and a pillar inscribed with a message from the Dalai Lama in English, Tibetan, Hindi and Chinese.\nIn August 2009 the museum announced the creation of the Imperial War Museum Foundation. Chaired by Jonathan Harmsworth, the great-grandson of the 1st Viscount who had secured the museum's Bethlem building, the foundation is charged with raising funds to support the refurbishment of the museum's permanent galleries. At the time of the announcement, the museum was planning for the refurbishment of its First World War gallery by 2014, the centenary of the outbreak of the war, and for the refurbishment of its Second World War and Post-1945 galleries by 2020, the museum's own centenary.\nBranches\nFrom the 1970s onwards the museum began to expand onto other sites. The first of these sites, a former RAF and United States Army Air Force airfield at Duxford in Cambridgeshire, was opened to the public on a regular basis in June 1976. HMS Belfast, a light cruiser moored in the Pool of London, has been under the care of the museum since 1978.\nImperial War Museum Duxford\nMain article: Imperial War Museum Duxford\nAirSpace at IWM Duxford.\nThe Duxford branch of the Imperial War Museum houses its large exhibits, including the aircraft and military and naval vehicles collection. The museum has seven main exhibition buildings with nearly 200 military and civil aircraft. A historic airfield, used for military flying since 1916; the last operational flight at Duxford was made in July 1961. The museum originally only used one of the site's hangars as temporary storage for part of its aircraft collection; however, following a series of popular air displays from 1973 onwards, the museum acquired the entire site for its use in February 1976.\nThe aircraft collection includes types such as a British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2 and the only SR-71 Blackbird on display outside the United States of America. The military vehicle collection includes command caravans used by Field Marshal Montgomery. The naval collection includes an example of an X-craft midget submarine and the Vosper motor torpedo boat MTB-71. The site provides accommodation for a number of regimental museums (including those of the Parachute Regiment, named Airborne Assault, and the Royal Anglian Regiment), and also provides additional collections storage. The site remains an active airfield and hosts regular air displays.\nHMS Belfast\nMain article: HMS Belfast (C35)\nCare of the light cruiser HMS Belfast, which had served throughout the Second World War, was transferred to the museum on 1 March 1978 after Shirley Williams, the then Secretary of State for Education and Science, accepted that the ship was \"a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology\".\nHMS Belfast at her berth in the Pool of London\nShe had been preserved for the nation since 1971 in the Pool of London under the care of a private charitable trust, the HMS Belfast Trust; the first such preservation of a naval ship since HMS Victory. The museum, along with the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence, had been involved in an earlier plan, which took place in the late 1960s, to preserve the ship, which the government on that occasion had declined in 1971.\nHMS Belfast was a notable vessel. Launched in March 1938 she served throughout the Second World War, participating in the Battle of North Cape and firing some of the first shots of Operation Overlord. She later served in the Korean War. The ship left Singapore on 26 March 1962 for the UK where she made a final visit to Belfast and after an exercise in the Mediterranean was paid off on 24 August 1963. In service for 24 years HMS Belfast was, in the view of historian Noble Frankland, capable of representing \"a whole generation of [historical evidence]\".\nChurchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms\nMain article: Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms\nThe Map Room of the Cabinet War Rooms\nIn 1984 the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public as a branch of the museum. The War Rooms are an underground complex that had been used as a command centre by the British government throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, the facilities were constructed before the war in anticipation of extremely destructive aerial bombing of London. They became operational in 1939 and were in constant operation for the duration of the war. The complex was abandoned in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan. The historical value of the Rooms was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit the War Rooms by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30-40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted. During the 1970s the Cabinet Office and the Department for the Environment, which was responsible for the Rooms after 1975, raised the possibility of the museum taking over the War Rooms. The museum was reluctant due to its new commitments related to Duxford and HMS Belfast, but agreed in 1982. The scheme was keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and she opened the War Rooms in April 1984.\nFollowing a major expansion in 2003 a suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost 7.5 million. In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The museum, the development of which cost a further 6 milion raised from private fundraising, makes extensive use of audiovisual technology. The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an 'electronic filing cabinet'.\nImperial War Museum North\nMain article: Imperial War Museum North\nEntrance of Imperial War Museum North in Manchester\nThe Imperial War Museum North was opened in Trafford, Greater Manchester in 2002, the first branch of the museum outside of southeast England. The museum's first floor main gallery space houses the permanent exhibitions. These consist of a chronological display which runs around the gallery's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in 'silos' within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture. Though exhibiting fewer large objects than other museum branches, Imperial War Museum North features in its main gallery a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jet, and a British 18-pounder field gun which fired the British Army's first shot of the First World War. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery.\nThe project to construct a branch of the museum in the north of England, was launched in January 1999 by the then Culture Secretary Chris Smith. The new building was the first of the branches to be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, it was his first building in Britain. Libeskind building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. Originally budgeted at 40 million, the museum was eventually completed for 28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings, a local transport and property company which contributed 12.5 million.\nThe London building\nA view of Bethlem Royal Hospital in 1828\nThe Imperial War Museum has had three homes. Originally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill, in 1920, the museum moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington during 1924, and finally in 1936 the museum acquired a permanent home in the former Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark. The hospital building was designed by the hospital surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by John Gandy and other architects, and construction completed in October 1814. The hospital consisted of a range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to Lambeth Road, with a central entrance under a portico.\nThe building was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In order to provide more space, he added blocks at either end of the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844-46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.\nThe building remained substantially unchanged until vacated by the hospital in 1930. After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere, the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 the ground floor of the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to William Orpen and John Lavery), a gallery on women's war work, and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings. This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards.\nThe original hospital building is now largely occupied by corporate offices. A 1966 extension? houses the library, art store, and document archives.Redevelopments in the 1980s created exhibition space over five floors, along with the acquisition of the All Saints Annexe, a former hospital building in Austral Street off West Square. The 1867 building, which backs onto Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, was originally an orphanage opened by local philanthropist Charlotte Sharman, then later used as a hospital. It houses the museum's photographic, film and sound archives, and offices.\nCollections\nThe collections include this photograph of Montgomery in his command tank, the tank itself, as well as Montgomery's papers and command caravan from the European campaign.\nThe Imperial War Museum's original collections date back to the material amassed by the National War Museum Committee. The present departmental organisation came into being during the 1960s as part of Frankland's reorganisation of the museum. The 1970s saw oral history gain increasing prominence and in 1972 the museum created the Department of Sound Records (now the Sound Archive) to record interviews with individuals who had experienced the First World War. Since the opening of the Holocaust and Crimes against Humanity exhibitions, a collecting department has been established to support them. The museum maintains an online database of its collections named Collections Online.\nMaterial from the collections are displayed at each of the museum's branches, and on five levels at the Lambeth Road site. The basement is occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts since 1945. The ground floor comprises the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, the permanent Children's War exhibition (extending into the basement), and visitor facilities. The first floor provides the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor features the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor houses the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor provides a further exhibition area in the vaulted roof space. From November 2010 this area will accommodate the Lord Ashcroft Gallery, exhibiting the museum's own collection of Victoria and George Crosses, and the private collection of Victoria Crosses amassed by Michael Ashcroft.\nDepartments\nThere are eight departments responsible for different aspects of the museum's collections.\nThe Department of Documents holds private papers such as letters and diaries from both individual soldiers and civilians to high-ranking officers such as Field Marshals Bernard Montgomery, Sir John French and Henry Maitland Wilson. Also of note are manuscripts by war poets Isaac Rosenberg and Siegfried Sassoon. The Department holds the official British records of the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunals and a variety of other official records. The Department also houses the UK National Inventory of War Memorials.\nThe Art department holds much of the work of official war artists from both world wars, and contemporary art from after 1945. As early as 1920 the art collection held over 3,000 works and included pieces by John Singer Sargent, Wyndham Lewis, John Nash and Christopher Nevinson. The collection expanded again after the Second World War, holding around 70% of the 6,000 works produced by the Ministry of Information's War Artists Advisory Committee. The collection also includes a large number of propaganda posters from many countries and periods.[a] In 1972 the museum's Artistic Records Committee was established to commission artists to cover contemporary conflicts.\nThe Film and Video Archive is one of the oldest film archives in Britain and preserves a range of historically significant film and video material. The collection includes the official British film record of the First World War and the 1916 feature film The Battle of the Somme, which is inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register. The collection also includes the official British film record of the Second World War, amateur film and film of other conflicts since 1945. Material from the collection was used to make a number of well-known TV documentary series including The Great War and The World at War.\nThe Photograph Archive preserves the official British photographic record of both World Wars and conflicts since 1945. It currently holds more than 6,000,000 images and the Second World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Bill Brandt, Cecil Beaton and Bert Hardy. Both the Film and Photograph Archives are official repositories for material produced by the Ministry of Defence and so include material from contemporary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe Department of Exhibits and Firearms is responsible for the care of the Museum's collection of three-dimensional objects. The cores of the collection are the firearms collection, collections of artillery, ordnance and vehicles, and medals and decorations such as the Victoria Cross and George Cross. Many of the department's larger exhibits are on display and can be seen in the photographs below. Other exhibits include artillery pieces whose crew won the Victoria Cross, a Lee Enfield rifle used by T. E. Lawrence, and a Colt 1911 automatic pistol owned by Winston Churchill.\nA still from The Battle of the Somme, kept in the Film and Video Archive\nThe Department of Printed Books is responsible for the Museum collection of printed materials including books, maps and ephemera. When the Museum was established the distinguished historian Sir Charles Oman was given responsibility for the library. In 1922 the library collection contained a reported 20,000 items and 60,000 items in 1953. Today the Museum gives the size of its library collection as 270,000 items.\nThe Sound Archive, originally named the Department of Sound Records, administers a collection of over 56,000 hours of historical recordings and was opened to the public in July 1977. The core of this collection are oral history interviews with people who were affected by war in the 20th century. This collection has been used for a series of radio programmes and books, called Forgotten Voices, about war in the 20th century. The collection also includes historic broadcasts, and actuality sound effects recorded during conflicts.\nThe Department of Holocaust and Genocide History supports the Holocaust and Crimes against Humanity exhibitions. The department seeks to acquire archival material and artefacts to illustrate its subject; notable acquisitions include the Gianfranco Moscati collection which documents the persecution of the Jews during the Second World War. The department also answers public and academic enquiries, advises other bodies working on related subjects, represents the museum at relevant events and supports the museums' educational activities. It also occasionally undertakes external consultancy, for instance assisting with the establishment of a memorial room at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nDirectors\nSince 1917 the museum has had six directors. The first was Sir Martin Conway, a noted art historian, mountaineer and explorer. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts to map the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas, and was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of Director until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley. Bradley had served in the First World War in the Middlesex Regiment before being invalided out in 1917. He later became acquainted with Charles ffoulkes, who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum's poster collection. Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr Noble Frankland. Frankland had served as a navigator in RAF Bomber Command, winning a Distinguished Flying Cross. While a Cabinet Office official historian he co-authored a controversial official history of the RAF strategic air campaign against Germany. Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr Alan Borg who had previously been at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. In 1995 Borg moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum and was succeeded by Sir Robert Crawford, who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968. Upon Crawford's retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by Diane Lees, previously Director of the V&A Museum of Childhood. She was noted in the media as the first woman appointed to lead a British national museum\nReferences\n^ Whitmore, Mark (letter to Frankie Roberto) (12 May 2008) WhatDoTheyKnow.comTotal number of objects in the Imperial War Museum's collection.

For other uses, see Sydenham (disambiguation) .\nSydenham\n Sydenham shown within Greater London\nPopulation\nCoordinates : 51°25′31″N 0°03′16″W﻿ / ﻿51.4254°N 0.0544°W﻿ / 51.4254; -0.0544\nSydenham ( /ˈsɪdnəm/ ) is a suburban district of south-east London in the London Boroughs of Lewisham . Located in Kent until 1889, when the County of London was created, Sydenham was historically a very affluent town and the Crystal Palace from the Great Exhibition was relocated to Sydenham Hill in 1854. Bordering Forest Hill , Dulwich , Crystal Palace , Penge , Beckenham , Catford and Bellingham ; Sydenham today is a diverse area with a 2011 population of 28,378. [1]\nContents\nHistory\nA map showing the Sydenham ward of Lewisham Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916.\nOriginally known as Shippenham, [2] Sydenham began as a small settlement, a few cottages among the woods, whose inhabitants grazed their animals and collected wood. In the 1640s, springs of water in what is now Wells Park were discovered to have medicinal properties, attracting crowds of people to the area. Sydenham grew rapidly in the 19th century after the introduction of the Croydon Canal in 1809 which linked the Grand Surrey Canal to Croydon and a reservoir was constructed in Sydenham. However, the canal was never successful and closed in 1836 [3] resulting in it being the first canal to be abandoned by an Act of Parliament. The London & Croydon Railway purchased the canal for £40,250 and quickly converted the alignment for a railway from London Bridge to West Croydon , opening in 1839. After the railway opened potential gas companies began to consider the Sydenham area with the Crystal Palace and District Gas Company having works at Bell Green, which continued production until 1969; a retail park now occupies most of the site.\nThe Crystal Palace\nIn 1851 the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park was housed in an immense glass building, called the Crystal Palace . In 1854 the building was bought by a private company, dismantled and re-erected in Sydenham Park (now called Crystal Palace Park ). Exhibitions, concerts, conferences and sporting events were held at the Crystal Palace (until it burned down in 1936), and Sydenham became a fashionable area; many new houses were built. In 1872, the Children's Hospital, Sydenham opened. It closed in 1991, its services being now part of the University Hospital Lewisham . [4]\nIn 1860, the Walter Cobb department store at Lawrie Place, Kirkdale (now known as Cobbs Corner) opened, lasting until the 1980s. In 1884, Upper Sydenham railway station opened on the Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway linking Crystal Palace to London Victoria via Peckham Rye. [5] The station and the line were poorly used despite new houses being built in the area, as passengers preferred to use other stations near-by Sydenham Hill (opening in 1863), Crystal Palace (Lower Level) and Sydenham which were on more direct routes. The ill fate of the Crystal Palace in 1936 saw patronage reduced and the route finally closed in 1954.\nSydenham was attacked by enemies during the Second World War . The gas works were a target, but were never damaged. The railway which ran through Upper Sydenham station was damaged, and some homes in the area were destroyed.\nLocal area\nSydenham is divided into several localities:\nApartment building on Sydenham Hill, SE26\nSydenham Hill in the Boroughs of Lewisham and Southwark runs alongside Dulwich and Sydenham Woods on one of the highest points of Greater London being 112 metres above sea level. [6] From here, the City of London skyline is visible. Sydenham Hill has an abandoned railway tunnel from the Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway located within the Woods. Another railway tunnel (one of the longest in Britain being 1,958 metres) goes beneath on the Chatham Main Line with Sydenham Hill station at the London end serving both Sydenham Hill and the College area of Dulwich.\nUpper Sydenham is also located on Sydenham Hill and is a part of the Parish of St Bartholomew . It is diverse both racially and in terms of income; the central section of Kirkdale was Sydenham's original High Street. Renamed \"Kirkdale\" in 1936, the area now has a small range of shops including Costcutter , Tesco Express , local pubs and off-licences. Sydenham School is located on Dartmouth Road with Forest Hill Library and Forest Hill Pools alongside Thorpewood Avenue. Green Flag awarded Sydenham Wells Park , the location of the once famous Springs is one of the largest parks within the postcode. Upper Sydenham is also the location of the Sydenham Park allotments, the Sydenham electricity sub station which had a major fire in 2008 [7] and the Sydenham Hill estate.\nLower Sydenham & Bell Green is the location of Sydenham Community Library which was recently reopened by the local community after the Lewisham Council closed it. The Bell Green regeneration project is in its second phase with a new retail park which opened in 2013, on a site which was formally a gas works. The retail park is home to Currys PC World , B&Q , Toys \"R\" Us , Pets at Home , Sports Direct , Next (with Costa Coffee ) and McDonald's among others. Sainsbury's have had a large store on one part of the site since the 1990s as part of the Savacentre brand and new residential apartments have also been constructed. The Bridge Leisure Centre is located on Kangley Bridge Road and Mayow Park is on the border with Forest Hill . Alongside the Hayes railway line and Lower Sydenham station, Lower Sydenham industrial estate houses the Clarkes of London coach company, City Link Beckenham and many other businesses as well as the Beckenham and Sydenham Cricket Ground.\nCommercial area\nSydenham's commercial area begins on Kirkdale around Cobbs Corner, continuing onto Sydenham Road often known as Sydenham High Street. It houses many independent stores, including bookshops, cafes and a bakery. Chain stores include Boots , Budgens , Ladbrokes , Sainsbury's Local , Tesco Express , Lidl , Subway and Superdrug . The Post Office has a location and for banking, Barclays , Natwest , Lloyds Bank and Santander also have branches.\nCommunity\nSydenham has a very active community, with several groups concerning the local area. Sydenham Town is the local website for the suburb, where residents can also voice their opinions in an on-line form. [8] The Sydenham Society is a Civil society formed in 1972 to represent the local community. It holds local events, works with organisations and authorities as well as campaigning for improvements to the area. [9] Green Flag and Mayor of London Award winner, Sydenham Garden, was formed in 2002. It is a charity which is involved in improving the health of residents in the boroughs of Bromley and Lewisham. [10]\nSydenham with Forest Hill won a bid for the national Portas Pilot competition which provided a grant to improve high streets, extra money was provided from Lewisham Council and private developers.\nConservation areas\nMayow Park was originally known as Sydenham Recreational Ground\nSydenham has seven Conservation Areas : Cobbs Corner, Dulwich Village (covering Crescent Wood Road), [13] Halifax Street, Sydenham Hill/Kirkdale, Sydenham Park and Sydenham Thorpes. Sydenham has the highest concentration of conservation areas in the London Borough of Lewisham [14]\nRecreation\nA number of parks are within the Sydenham postcode. Mayow Park , Lewisham's oldest municipal park [15] and Sydenham Wells Park [16] are both Green Flag Awarded. Other open spaces in Sydenham include Alexandra Recreation Ground, [17] Baxters Field, [18] Home Park [19] and Kirkdale Green. [20] Riverview Walk is a nature conservation area [21] which runs along the River Ravensbourne from Catford. Additionally, located along the borders of Sydenham, there are Crystal Palace Park , Dulwich Woods , Southend Park [22] and Sydenham Hill Woods .\nSydenham Arts\nSydenham Arts is a local charitable organisation, [23] promoting the arts for the local community, which provides free and ticketed cultural events at several festivals through the year. [24] [25] [26] In June 2016, former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion , who spoke at Sydenham Arts Festival in 2011, was quoted saying \"Sydenham Arts Festival is exemplary: packed with high-quality speakers from elsewhere, but also fully alive to and supportive of things growing close to home. It means that imaginable adventures can combine with imaginative confirmations - just as they should. Long may it flourish.\" [27]\nNotable buildings and structures\nDrinking fountain erected to commemorate the 1897 Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria\nSydenham is the home of St Bartholomew's church , (1827–1832), at the end of Lawrie Park Avenue, featured in Camille Pissarro 's painting of 1871.

On 9 September 2008 a blue English Heritage plaque was placed on the house to commemorate this fact.\nHalifax Street, beautifully preserved street with houses dating from the 1840s. Of notice are in particular the closeness of the houses, the length of the street and the size of the gardens.\nThe Kirkdale Building, previously the Sydenham Public Lecture Hall, was built in 1861 by Sydenham resident Henry Dawson.\nEducation\nSydenham contains two secondary schools, the private Sydenham High School and Sydenham School . Both of these schools are exclusively girls' schools.\nThere are five are non-religious primary schools in Sydenham (Alexandra, Adamsrill, Eliot Bank, Haseltine and Kelvin Grove) and three religious schools (St. Michael's, St Philip Neri and St. Bartholomew's Church of England). Near Sydenham are secondary schools which include residents of Sydenham in their catchment area. These include Forest Hill , Harris Crystal Palace, Harris Girls Academy Bromley(Cator Park) for Girls and Sedgehill Schools. There are no colleges in Sydenham, but Sydenham and Forest Hill schools have a joint sixth form.\nPopulation\nAccording to the 2011 census, the SE26 postcode area had a population of 28,378, with 13,714 males and 14,664 females.

High Street improvements being funded by Transport for London from September 2012 are making the increasingly busy Sydenham Road (A212) more user friendly. So far, Kirkdale to Mayow Road has been completed, with Mayow Road to Kent House Road currently, as of December 2013, being upgraded. The Kent House Road to Bell Green section is still waiting for funding to be found. [36]\nGeography\nThe River Pool at Lower Sydenham\nSydenham is approximately 7 miles (11 kilometres) to the south east of Charing Cross . It is also at the centre of many of south London's major shopping districts being 3 mi (5 km) south of Lewisham, 3.2 mi (5.1 km) north west of Bromley and 3 1⁄2 mi (5.6 km) north of Croydon.\nUpper Sydenham and Sydenham Hill is located on the large Norwood Ridge formed of London Claygate beds deposits; Sydenham Hill is one of the highest points in London at 367 feet (112 m). Sydenham Hill Wood is a nine-hectare [37] nature reserve located west of Sydenham Hill Road, along with Dulwich and Sydenham Hill Golf course. The hill was once covered by the Great North Wood which covered all of Sydenham, Norwood, Woodside , Gipsy Hill etc. In the 19th Century it was home to the spa and health resort of Sydenham Wells .\nThe western parts of Sydenham, from Upper Sydenham and Forest Hill towards Crystal Palace Park is a more leafy, suburban area with some parts like the Lawrie Park and Thorpes areas being more affluent than others. Lower Sydenham at the bottom of more gentle slopes being east of Upper Sydenham, south of Forest Hill and west of Bellingham. The River Pool , a 5.1 mi (8.2 km) tributary of the River Ravensbourne straddles the east of Lower Sydenham along the Hayes railway line .\nClimate\nThe nearest Met Office climate station is based in Greenwich Park :\nClimate data for London ( Greenwich )\nMonth",
                "Interior of Crystal Palace, Sydenham, London | Artware Fine Art\nRev John Louis  Petit, 1801 - 1868\nInterior of Crystal Palace, Sydenham, London\nInterior of Crystal Palace, Sydenham, London\nSigned/Inscribed: \nEnquire about this item\nNotes\nThe Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass structure erected in Hyde Park, London, England, to house the the Great Exhibition of 1851. More than 14,000 exhibitors from around the world gathered in its 990,000 square feet (92,000 m2) of exhibition space to display examples of the technology developed during the Industrial Revolution. Designed by Sir Joseph Paxton, the Great Exhibition building was 1,851 feet (564 m) long, with an interior height of 128 feet (39 m). The invention of the cast plate glass method in 1848 made possible the production of large sheets of cheap but strong glass, and its use in the Crystal Palace created a structure with the greatest area of glass ever seen in a building and astonished visitors with its clear walls and ceilings that did not require interior lights.Its name Crystal Palace was result of a piece penned by the playwright Douglas Jerrold, who in July 1850 wrote in the satirical magazine Punch as 'Mrs Amelia Mouser' about the forthcoming Great Exhibition of 1851, referring to a palace of very crystal. The name was subsequently repeated even though the building had not been approved.\nAfter the exhibition, the building was rebuilt in an enlarged form on Penge Common, at the top of Penge Peak next to Sydenham Hill, an affluent south London suburb full of large villas. It stood there from 1854 until its destruction by fire in 1936.The name was later used to denote this area of south London and the park that surrounds the site, home of the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre as well as Crystal Palace F.C. who were founded at the Crystal Palace. A re-working of the building, known as The Garden Palace, was constructed in Sydney in 1879, but this building too was destroyed by fire. In 2013 a proposal was made to re-build the Crystal Palace within the Crystal Palace Park, but the project was cancelled in 2015. The park still contains Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins's Crystal Palace Dinosaurs from 1854.\nThe Commission in charge of mounting the Great Exhibition was established in January 1850, and it was decided at the outset that the entire project would be funded by public subscription. An executive Building Committee was quickly formed to oversee the design and construction of the exhibition building, comprising Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Robert Stephenson, renowned architects Charles Barry and Thomas Leverton Donaldson, the Duke of Buccleuch and the Earl of Ellesmere, and chaired by William Cubitt. By 15 March 1850 they were ready to invite submissions, which had to conform to several key specifications: the building had to be temporary, simple, as cheap as possible, and economical to build within the short time remaining before the Exhibition opening, which had already been scheduled for 1 May 1851.\nWithin three weeks, the committee had received some 245 entries, including 38 international submissions from Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hanover, Switzerland, Brunswick, Hamburg and France. Two designs, both in iron and glass, were singled out for praise - one by Richard Turner, co-designer of the Palm House at Kew, and the other by French architect Hector Horeau[8] but despite the great number of submissions, the Committee rejected them all. Turner was furious at the rejection, and reportedly badgered the commissioners for months afterwards, seeking compensation, but at an estimated £300,000, his design (like Horeau's) was too expensive. As a last resort the committee came up with a standby design of its own, for a brick building in the rundbogenstil by Donaldson, featuring a sheet-iron dome designed by Brunel but it was widely criticized and ridiculed when it was published in the newspapers. Adding to the Committee's woes, the site for the Exhibition was still not confirmed; the preferred site was in Hyde Park, adjacent to Princes Gate near Kensington Rd, but other sites considered included Wormwood Scrubs, Battersea Park, the Isle of Dogs, Victoria Park and Regent's Park. Opponents of the scheme lobbied strenuously against the use of Hyde Park (and they were strongly supported by The Times). The most outspoken critic was arch-conservative Col. Charles de Laet Waldo Sibthorp; he denounced the Exhibition as \"one of the greatest humbugs, frauds and absurdities ever known\", and his trenchant opposition to both the Exhibition and its building continued even after it had closed.\nAt this point renowned gardener Joseph Paxton became interested in the project, and with the enthusiastic backing of Commission member Henry Cole, he decided to submit his own design. At this time, Paxton was chiefly known for his celebrated career as the head gardener for the 6th Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth House; by 1850 he had become a preeminent figure in British horticulture and had also earned great renown as a freelance garden designer - his works included the pioneering public gardens at Birkenhead Park which directly influenced the design of New York's Central Park. At Chatsworth, Paxton had experimented extensively with glasshouse construction, developing many novel techniques for modular construction, using combinations of standard-sized sheets of glass, laminated wood, and prefabricated cast iron. The \"Great Stove\" (or conservatory) at Chatsworth (built in 1836) was the first major application of Paxton's now-famous ridge-and-furrow roof design, and was at the time the largest glass building in the world, covering around 28,000 square feet (2600 sq.m.). A decade later, taking advantage of the availability of the new cast plate glass, Paxton further developed his techniques with the Chatsworth Lily House, which featured a flat-roof version of the ridge-and-furrow glazing, and a curtain wall system that allowed the hanging of vertical bays of glass from cantilevered beams. The Lily House was built specifically to house the giant Victoria amazonica waterlily which had only recently been discovered by European botanists; the first specimen to reach England was originally kept at Kew Gardens, but it did not do well. Paxton's reputation as a gardener was so high by that time that he was invited to take the lily to Chatsworth; it thrived under his care and in 1849 he caused a sensation in the horticultural world when he succeeded in producing the first amazonica flowers to be grown in England (his daughter Alice was famously drawn for the newspapers, standing on one of leaves). The lily and its house led directly to Paxton's design for the Crystal Palace and he later cited the huge ribbed floating leaves as a key inspiration.\nPaxton left his 9 June 1850 meeting with Henry Cole fired with enthusiasm. He immediately went to Hyde Park, where he 'walked' the site earmarked for the Exhibition. Two days later, on 11 June, while attending a board meeting of the Midland Railway, Paxton made his original concept drawing, which he famously doodled onto a sheet of pink blotting paper. This rough sketch (now in the Victoria & Albert Museum) incorporated all the basic features of the finished building, and it is a mark of Paxton's ingenuity and industriousness that detailed plans, calculations and costings were ready to submit in less than two weeks. The project was a major gamble for Paxton, but circumstances were in his favour - he enjoyed a stellar reputation as a garden designer and builder, he was confident that his design was perfectly suited to the brief, and the Commission was now under enormous pressure to choose a design and get it built - the Exhibition opening was now less than a year away. In the event, Paxton's design fulfilled and surpassed all the requirements, and it proved to be vastly faster and cheaper to build than any other form of building of a comparable size. Indeed, his submission was budgeted at a remarkably low £85,800 - by comparison, this was only about 2-1/2 times more than the Great Stove at Chatsworth[16] but it was only 28% of the estimated cost of Turner's design, and it promised a building which, with a footprint of over 770,000 sq.ft. (19 acres, or 7 hectares), would cover roughly twenty-five times the ground area of its progenitor.Impressed by the low bid for the construction contract submitted by the engineering firm Fox, Henderson and Co, the commission accepted the scheme and finally gave its public endorsement to Paxton's design in July 1850. He was exultant, but now had less than eight months to finalize his plans, manufacture the parts and erect the building in time for the Exhibition's opening, which was scheduled for 1 May 1851. Paxton was able to design and build the largest glass structure yet created, from scratch, in less than a year, and complete it on schedule and on budget. He was even able to alter the design shortly before building began, adding a high, barrel-vaulted transept across the centre of the building, at 90 degrees to the main gallery, under which he was able to safely enclose several large elm trees that would otherwise have had to be felled - thereby also resolving a controversial issue that had been a major sticking point for the vocal anti-Exhibition lobby.\nPaxton's modular, hierarchical design reflected his practical brilliance as a designer and problem-solver. It incorporated many breakthroughs, offered practical advantages that no conventional building could match and, above all, embodied the spirit of British innovation and industrial might that the Great Exhibition was intended to celebrate. The geometry of the Crystal Palace was a classic example of the concept of form following function - the shape and size of the whole building was directly based around the size of the panes of glass made by the supplier, Chance Brothers of Smethwick. These were the largest available at the time, measuring 10 inches wide by 49 inches long. Because the entire building was scaled around those dimensions, it meant that nearly the whole outer surface could be glazed using millions of identical panes, thereby drastically reducing both their production cost and the time needed to install them.The original Hyde Park building was essentially a vast, flat-roofed rectangular hall. A huge open gallery ran along the main axis, with wings extending down either side. The main exhibition space was two stories high, with the upper floor stepped in from the boundary. Most of the building had a flat-profile roof, except for the central transept, which was covered by a 72 foot wide barrel-vaulted roof that stood 168 feet high at the top of the arch. Both the flat-profile sections and the arched transept roof were constructed using the key element of Paxton's design - his patented ridge-and-furrow roofing system, which had first use at Chatsworth. The basic roofing unit, in essence, took the form of a long triangular prism, which made it both extremely light and very strong, and meant it could be built with the minimum amount of materials. Paxton set the dimensions of this prism by using the length of single pane of glass (49 inches) as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, thereby creating a triangle with a length-to-height ratio of 2.5:1, whose base (adjacent side) was 4 feet long. By mirroring this triangle he obtained the 8-foot-wide gables that formed the vertical faces at either end of the prism, each of which was 24' long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that did not need to be trimmed. Paxton placed three of these 8' x 24' roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars. The resulting cube, with a floor area of 24'x 24', formed the basic structural module of the building.\nBy multiplying these modules into a grid, the structure could be extended virtually infinitely. In its original form, the ground level of the Crystal Palace (in plan) measured 1848' x 456', which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide.[17] Because each module was self-supporting, Paxton was able to leave out modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic 24' x 24' grid unit. The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. Paxton also used longer trellis girders to create a clear span for the roof of the immense central gallery, which was 72 feet wide and 1800 feet long.\nPaxton's roofing system incorporated his elegant solution to the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydnenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional - during construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering - a patented design now widely known as a \"Paxton gutter\". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function - each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building. One of the few issues Paxton could not completely solve was leaks - when completed, rain was found to be leaking into the huge building in over a thousand places. The leaks were sealed with putty, but the relatively poor quality of the sealant materials available at the time meant that the problem was never totally overcome.\nMaintaining a comfortable temperature inside such a large glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely on the fact that they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been be exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions - they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22 cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1 cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Due to the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function - the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors at the end of each day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly. Thanks to the considerable economies of scale Paxton was able to exploit, the manufacture and assembly of the building parts was exceedingly quick and cheap. Each module was identical, fully prefabricated, self-supporting, and fast and easy to erect. All of the parts could be mass-produced in large numbers, and many parts served multiple functions, further reducing both the number of parts needed and their overall cost. Because of its comparatively low weight, the Crystal Palace required absolutely no heavy masonry for supporting walls or foundations, and the relatively light concrete footings on which it stood could be left in the ground once the building was removed (they remain in place today just beneath the surface of the site). The modules could be erected as quickly as the parts could reach the site - indeed, some sections were standing within eighteen hours of leaving the factory - and since each unit was self-supporting, workers were able to assemble much of the building section-by-section, without having to wait for other parts to be finished.\nFox, Henderson took possession of the site in July 1850 and erected wooden hoardings which were constructed using the timber that later became the floorboards of the finished building. More than 5000 navvies worked on the building during its construction, with up to 2000 on site at one time during the peak building phase. More than 1,000 iron columns supported 2,224 trellis girders and 30 miles of guttering, comprising 4,000 tonnes of iron in all. First, stakes were driven into the ground to roughly mark out the positions for the cast iron columns; these points were then set precisely by theodolite measurements. Then the concrete foundations were poured, and the base plates for the columns were set into them. Once the foundations were in place, the erection of the modules proceeded rapidly. Connector brackets were attached to the top of each column before erection, and these were then hoisted into position. Since the project took place before the development of powered cranes, the raising of the columns was done manually using shears (or shear legs), a simple crane mechanism. These consisted of two strong poles, which were set several metres apart at the base and then lashed together at the top to form a triangle; this was stabilized and kept vertical by guy ropes fixed to the apex, stretched taut and tied to stakes driven into the ground some distance away. Using pulleys and ropes hung from the apex of the shear, the navvies hoisted the columns, girders and other parts into place. As soon as two adjacent columns had been erected, a girder was hoisted into place between them and bolted onto the connectors. The columns were erected in opposite pairs, then two more girders were connected to form a self-supporting square—this was the basic frame of each module. The shears would then be moved along and an adjoining bay constructed. When a reasonable number of bays had been completed, the columns for the upper floor were erected (longer shear-legs were used for this, but the operation was essentially the same as for the ground floor). Once the ground floor structure was complete, the final assembly of the upper floor followed rapidly. For the glazing, Paxton used larger versions of machines he had originally devised for the Great Stove at Chatsworth, installing on-site production line systems, powered by steam engines, that dressed and finished the building parts. These included a machine that mechanically grooved the wooden window sash bars, and a painting machine that automatically dipped the parts in paint and then passed them through a series of rotating brushes to remove the excess.\nThe last major components to be put into place were the sixteen semi-circular ribs of the vaulted transept, which were also the only major structural parts that were made of wood. These were raised into position as eight pairs, and all were fixed into place within a week. Thanks to the simplicity of Paxton's design and the combined efficiency of the building contractor and their suppliers, the entire structure was assembled with extraordinary speed—the team of 80 glaziers could fix more than 18,000 panes of sheet glass in a week—and the building was complete and ready to receive exhibits in just five months.When completed, The Crystal Palace provided an unrivaled space for exhibits, since it was essentially a self-supporting shell standing on slim iron columns, with no internal structural walls whatsoever. Because it was covered almost entirely in glass, it also needed no artificial lighting during the day, thereby reducing the Exhibition's running costs.Full-size elm trees growing in the park were enclosed within the central exhibition hall near the 27-foot (8 m) tall Crystal Fountain. Sparrows became a nuisance; shooting was obviously out of the question in a glass building. Queen Victoria mentioned this problem to the Duke of Wellington, who offered the famous solution, \"Sparrowhawks, Ma'am\". Paxton was acclaimed worldwide for his achievement, and was knighted by Queen Victoria in recognition of his work. The project was engineered by Sir William Cubitt; Paxton's construction partner was the ironwork contractor Sir Charles Fox's Fox and Henderson, whose director Charles Fox was also knighted for his contribution. The 900,000 square feet (84,000 m2) of glass was provided by the Chance Brothers glassworks in Smethwick. They were the only glassworks capable of fulfilling such a large order and had to bring in labour from France to meet it in time. The final dimensions were 1,848 feet (563 m) long by 456 feet (139 m) wide. The building was 135 feet (41 m) high, with 772,784 square feet (71,794.0 m2) on the ground floor alone.\nThe Great Exhibition was opened on 1 May 1851 by Queen Victoria. It was the first of the World's Fair exhibitions of culture and industry. There were some 100,000 objects, displayed along more than ten miles, by over 15,000 contributors. Britain occupied half the display space inside with exhibits from the home country and the Empire. France was the largest foreign contributor. The exhibits were grouped into four main categories—Raw Materials, Machinery, Manufacturers and Fine Arts. The exhibits ranged from the Koh-i-Noor diamond, Sevres porcelain and music organs to a massive hydraulic press and a fire-engine. There was also a 27-foot tall Crystal Fountain.At first the price of admission was £3 for gentlemen, £2 for ladies, later the masses were let in for only a shilling a head. Six million people—equivalent to a third of the entire population of Britain at the time—visited the Great Exhibition. The event made a surplus of £186,000 (£18,190,000 in 2015), money which was used to found the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum in South Kensington.The Crystal Palace had the first major installation of public toilets, the Retiring Rooms, in which sanitary engineer George Jennings installed his \"Monkey Closet\" flushing lavatory (initially just for men, but later catering for women also). During the exhibition, 827,280 visitors each paid one penny to use them (from which originated the euphemism \"spending a penny\").\nThe Great Exhibition closed on 11 October 1851. The life of the Great Exhibition was limited to six months, after which something had to be done with the building. Against the wishes of Parliamentary opponents, a consortium of eight businessmen including Samuel Laing and Leo Schuster (both board members of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR)), formed a suitable holding company and proposed that the edifice be erected on a property named Penge Place that had been excised from Penge Common atop Sydenham Hill.\nThe constructing of the building began on Sydenham Hill in 1852. The new building, while incorporating most of the constructional parts of the Hyde Park building, was so completely different in form as to be properly considered a quite different structure – a 'Beaux-arts' form in glass and metal. The main gallery was redesigned and covered with a new barrel-vaulted roof, the central transept was greatly enlarged and made even higher, and two new transepts were added at either end of the main gallery. It was modified and enlarged so much that it extended beyond the boundary of Penge Place, which was also the boundary between Surrey and Kent. The reconstruction was recorded for posterity by Philip Henry Delamotte, and his photographs were widely disseminated in his published works. Several localities claim to be the area to which the building was moved. The street address of the Crystal Palace was Sydenham S.E. (SE26 after 1917), but the actual building and parklands were in Penge. When built, most of the buildings were in the borough of Croydon, as were the majority of grounds, but in 1899 the county boundary was moved, transferring the entire site to Penge Urban District in Kent. The site is now within the Crystal Palace Ward of the London Borough of Bromley.\nTwo railway stations were opened to serve the permanent exhibition: Crystal Palace High Level: developed by the SER, it was an impressive building designed by Edward Barry, from which a subway under the Parade led directly to the entrance. Crystal Palace Low Level: developed by laing and Schuster's LB&SCR, it is located just off Anerley Road. The Low Level Station is still in use as Crystal Palace, while the only remains of the High Level Station are the subway under the Parade with its Italian mosaic roofing, a Grade II listed building. The South Gate is served by Penge West Railway Station. For some time this station was on an atmospheric railway. This is often confused with a 550-metre pneumatic passenger railway which was exhibited at the Crystal Palace in 1864, which was known as the Crystal Palace pneumatic railway.\nDozens of experts such as Matthew Digby Wyatt and Owen Jones were hired to create a series of courts that provided a narrative of the history of fine art. Amongst these were Augustus Pugin's Mediaeval Court from the Great Exhibition, as well as courts illustrating Egyptian, Alhambra, Roman, Renaissance, Pompeian, and Grecian art and many others.] During the year of re-opening 18 handbooks were published in the Crystal Palace Library by Bradbury & Evans as guides to the new installations. Many of these were written by the specialists involved in creating and curating the new displays. So the 1854 guide to the Egyptian Court, destroyed in the 1866 fire, was entitled: 'The Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace. Described by Owen Jones, architect, and Joseph Bonomi, sculptor'. That which included a description of the dinosaurs was entitled: 'Geology and Inhabitants of the Ancient World. Described by Richard Owen, FRS. The animals constructed by B.W.Hawkins, FGS'. In the central transept was the 4,000-piece Grand Orchestra built around the 4,500-pipe Great Organ. There was a concert room with over 4,000 seats that hosted successful Handel Festivals for many years.[30] The performance spaces hosted concerts, exhibits, and public entertainment.[6] The Centre Transept of the Crystal Palace also once housed a circus and was the scene of daring feats by world famous acts such as the tightrope walker Charles Blondin. Over the years many famous leaders visited the Crystal Palace, and were accorded special festivals, with extended published programs. That for Garibaldi was entitled \"General Garibaldi's Italian Reception and Concert Saturday April 16 1864\"; and that for the Shah: \"Crystal Palace. Grand Fête in honour of His Majesty The Shah of Persia KG. Saturday July 6th\" (1889). From the beginning general programs were printed, at first for the summer season, and then on a daily basis. So for instance that for the summer of 1864 \"Programme of arrangements for the eleventh season, commencing on the 1st May, 1864\" included the Shakespeare Tercentenary Festival and a course by designer Christopher Dresser. The daily \"Programme for Monday October 6th (1873) included a harvest exhibition of fruit, and the Australasian Collection, formed by H E Pain, of materials from Tasmania, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Australia, NZ; and grand military fete was also on offer. Many of these publications were printed by Dickens and Evans, that is Charles Dickens jnr., Dickens' son working with his father-in-law Frederick Evans. Another feature of the early programming were Christmas pantomimes, with published librettos, for instance Harry Lemon's 'Dick Whittington and His Wonderful Cat. Crystal Palace Christmas 1869–70' (London 1869).\nIn 1868, the world's first aeronautical exhibition was held in the Crystal Palace. In 1871, the world's first cat show, organised by Harrison Weir, was held there. Other shows, such as dog shows, pigeon shows, honey, flower shows, as well as the first national motor show were also held at Crystal Palace.[31] The match which later has been dubbed the world's first bandy match was held at the Crystal Palace in 1875; at the time, the game was called \"hockey on the ice\".The new site was also the location of one of Charles Spurgeon's famous sermons, without amplification, before a crowd of 23,654 people on 7 October 1857. A colourful description of a visit to the Crystal Palace appears in John Davidson's poem 'The Crystal Palace' published in 1909. In 1909, Robert Baden-Powell first noticed the interest of girls in Scouting while attending a Boy Scout meeting at Crystal Palace. This observation later led to the formation of Girl Guides, then Girl Scouts.\nIn 1911, the Festival of Empire was held at the building to mark the coronation of George V and Queen Mary. Large pavilions were built for and by the colonies, that for Canada for instance replicating the Parliament in Ottawa. A good record of the Festival is provided by the photogravure plates in the sale catalogue published shortly afterwards by Knight, Frank and Rutley and Horne & Co \"The Crystal Palace Sydenham To be sold at auction on Tuesday 28th November\" (London, 1911) During the First World War, it was used as a naval training establishment under the name of HMS Victory VI, informally known as HMS Crystal Palace. More than 125,000 men from the Royal Naval Division, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and Royal Naval Air Service were trained for war at Victory VI.\nTowards the end of the First War World War, the Crystal Palace re-opened as the site of the first Imperial War Museum; in 1920 this major initiative was fully launched with a program as the 'Imperial War Museum and Great Victory Exhibition Crystal Palace' (published by Photocrom). A few years later the Imperial War Museum moved to South Kensington, and then in the 1930s to its present site Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, formerly Bedlam. An 1853 model of an Iguanodon; the most recognisable of the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs The development of ground and gardens of the park cost considerably more than the rebuilt Crystal Palace. Edward Milner designed the Italian Garden and fountains, the Great Maze, and the English Landscape Garden. Raffaele Monti was hired to design and build much of the external statuary around the fountain basins, and the urns, tazzas and vases.[29] The sculptor Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was commissioned to make 33 lifesized models of the (then) newly discovered dinosaurs and other extinct animals in the park. The Palace and its park became the location of many shows, concerts and exhibitions, as well as sporting events after the construction of various sports grounds on the site. On the new site were also various buildings that housed educational establishments such as the Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature as well as engineering schools.\nJoseph Paxton was first and foremost a gardener, and his layout of gardens, fountains, terraces and cascades left no doubt as to his ability. One thing he did have a problem with was water supply. Such was his enthusiasm that thousands of gallons of water were needed to feed the myriad fountains and cascades abounding in the Crystal Palace Park: the two main jets were 250 feet (76 m) high. Water towers were duly constructed, but the weight of water in the raised tanks caused them to collapse. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was consulted and came up with plans for two mighty water towers, one at the north end of the building and one at the south. Each supported a tremendous load of water, which was gathered from three reservoirs, at either end of and in the middle of the park. The grand fountains and cascades were opened, again in the presence of the Queen, who got wet when a gust of wind swept mists of spray over the royal carriage.\nWhile the original palace cost £150,000 (£14.7 million in 2015),[22] the move to Sydenham cost £1,300,000—(£117 million in 2015),[22] burdening the company with a debt it never repaid,[39] partly because admission fees were depressed by the inability to cater for Sunday visitors: many people worked every day except Sunday,[40] when the Palace had always been closed.[41] The Lord's Day Observance Society held that people should not be encouraged to work at the Palace on Sunday, and that if people wanted to visit, then their employers should give them time off during the working week. However, the Palace was open on Sundays by May 1861, when 40,000 visitors came.By the 1890s the Palace's popularity and state of repair had deteriorated; the appearance of stalls and booths had made it a more downmarket attraction.\nIn the years after the Festival of Empire the building fell into disrepair, as the huge debt and maintenance costs became unsustainable, and in 1911 bankruptcy was declared. In 1914 the Earl of Plymouth bought it, to save it from developers. A public subscription subsequently bought it from the Earl for the nation. In the 1920s, a board of trustees was set up under the guidance of manager Sir Henry Buckland. He is said to have been a firm but fair man, who had a great love for the Crystal Palace,[44] and soon set about restoring the deteriorating building. The restoration not only brought visitors back, but also meant that the Palace started to make a small profit once more.[36] Buckland and his staff also worked on improving the fountains and gardens,[45] including the Thursday evening displays of fireworks by Brocks.\nOn 30 November 1936 came the final catastrophe – fire. Within hours the Palace was destroyed: the glow was visible across eight counties. That night, Buckland was walking his dog near the palace, with his daughter (Crystal Buckland, named after the palace when they noticed a red glow within. Inside, he found two of his employees fighting a small office fire, that had started after an explosion in the women's cloakroom. Realising that it was a serious fire, they called the Penge fire brigade. But, even though 89 fire engines and over 400 firemen arrived they were unable to extinguish it. (The fire spread quickly in the high winds that night,because it could consume the dry old timber flooring,and the huge quantity of flammable materials in the building.) Buckland said, \"In a few hours we have seen the end of the Crystal Palace. Yet it will live in the memories not only of Englishmen, but the whole world\". 100,000 people came to Sydenham Hill to watch the blaze, among them Winston Churchill, who said, \"This is the end of an age\".Just as in 1866, when the north transept burnt down, the building was not adequately insured to cover the cost of rebuilding (at least two million pounds).\nThe South Tower had been used for tests by television pioneer John Logie Baird for his mechanical television experiments, and much of his work was destroyed in the fire. All that was left standing after the 1936 fire were the two water towers. In a November 2011 interview with the Crystal Palace Museum the true story of the towers was revealed.The south tower to the right of the Crystal Palace entrance was taken down shortly after the fire, as the damage sustained had undermined its integrity and it presented a major risk to houses nearby.\nThe north tower was demolished with explosives in 1941.No reason was given for its removal, although it was rumoured that it was to remove a landmark for WWII German aircraft, but Luftwaffe bombers actually navigated their way to Central London by tracking the River Thames. The Crystal Palace grounds were also used as a manufacturing base for aircraft radar screens and other hi-tech equipment of the time. This remained secret until well after the war.\nArtist biography\nJohn Louis Petit was born at Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, son of John Hayes Petit. He was educated at Eton, and contributed to the \"Etonian\". He was elected to a scholarship at Trinity College Cambridge in 1822, graduated BA in 1823 and MA in 1826, and on 21st June 1850 he was admitted \"ad eundem\" at Oxford. He took holy orders in 1824, but undertook no parochial work. Petit showed a taste for sketching in early years. His favourite subject was old churches, and a great part of his life was spent in visiting and sketching them. In 1839 he made his first extensive tour of the continent. The results appeared in his \"Remarks on Church Architectire\" (1841, 2 vols which had illustratuions. It was followed in 1846 by \"Remarks on Church Architectural Character\" Royal folio format.In the same year Petit published a lecture which he had delivered on 24th Feb 1846 to the Oxford Society for promoting the study of Gothic Architecture, under the title \"Remarks on the Principles of Gothic Architecture as applied to ordinary Parish Churches\". It was succeeded by \"Architectire of Tewksbury Abbey Church\". Royal svo 1846. \" Architectural notes in the neighbourhood of Cheltenham\"and \"Remarks on Wimborne Minster\", 1847. \"Remarks on Southwell Minster\". With numerous good illustrations. 1848. \"Architectural Notices relating to Churches in Gloucestershire and Susse\". 1849. \"Architectural Notices of the Curious Church of Gillingham.Norfolk\". And an \"Account of Sherborne Minster\". 1850. In 1852 Petit published an account of Brinkburn Priory\". In 1854 appeared Petit's principal work. \"Architectural Studies in France\", imperial SVO. It was beautifully illustrated with fine woodcuts and facsimiles of anastic drawings by the author and his companion, Professor Delamotte. It showed much learningand observation, and threw light upon the formation of Gothic in France, and on the differences between English and French Gothic. A new edition , revised by Edward Bell, FSA, with introduction, notes and index, appeared in 1890. The text remained unaltered but the illustrations were reduced in size, and a few added from Petit's unused woodcuts. In 1864-65 he travelled in the East and executed some striking drawings. He died in Lichfield on 2 Dec 1868, from a cold caught while sketching and was buried in St Micheal's Churchyard. Petit was the founder of the British Archealogical Institute at Cambridge in 1844. He was also FSA, an honoury member of the Institute of British Architects, and a governor of Christ's hospital.\nsign up to our newsletter\nyour name",
                "Crystal Palace Park (Part One) | View from the Mirror\nView from the Mirror\nBy View from the Mirror on\nApril 7, 2013\nSpread across an impressive slope in Sydenham, South London, Crystal Palace Park is one of the capital’s most intriguing green spaces.\nSatellite view of Crystal Palace Park (image: Google)\nOrigins\nThe locale has always been a noted beauty spot.\nBefore Crystal Palace Park was established, the area formed the grounds of ‘Penge Place’ (‘Penge’ deriving from the Celtic word, ‘Penceat’ meaning ‘on the edge of a wood’); a large, Tudor-style manor house built at the beginning of the 19th century by Edward Blore.\nPenge Place (image: Ideal Homes)\nIn its present form, the park owes its existence to an event which took place in 1851- The Great Exhibition; a five-month long celebration of all the world had to offer in terms of culture and technology.\nInside The Great Exhibition.\nEssentially the world’s first expo, The Great Exhibition was hosted north of the Thames in Hyde Park, housed within a vast, purpose-built structure forged from metal and glass….a building which the satirical magazine, Punch dubbed the “Crystal Palace”.\nThe Crystal Palace in its original location; the south-eastern corner of Hyde Park.\nBetween May and October 1851 millions from across both the UK and the world flocked to wonder at the Victorian marvel, firmly planting the building in the public psyche.\nBy the time the exhibition closed its doors, much of the British public had grown exceptionally fond of their ‘People’s Palace’ and there was great concern that the temporary structure was about to be lost forever.\nLuckily, Salvation was at hand thanks to two solicitors- Messrs Leech and Farquhar who suggested that the palace be dismantled and resurrected elsewhere. This plan was quickly adopted and, within less than a year, a site in Sydenham had been earmarked as the new home; a location which the palace’s original architect, Sir Joseph Paxton, described as “the most beautiful spot in the world” for his celebrated creation.\nA huge bust of Sir Joseph Paxton, which can seen in Crystal Palace Park.\nIn just two years the huge structure was carefully taken apart and transported to the south London green spot where it was skilfully reassembled and expanded.\nThe second incarnation of the Crystal Palace incorporated galleries representing the histories and cultures of numerous nations. For these installations, specialist craftsmen from abroad were drafted in to create the representations of their homelands. As one guide-book from the time noted, many firm friendships between these fellows and their British counterparts were made in the “palace of peace.”\nReconstruction work, pictured in an 1854 edition of the ‘London Illustrated News’.\nDespite the enthusiasm, the project was not without tragedy.\nIn August 1853 during the building’s reconstruction, a section of scaffolding collapsed, plunging ten workmen 170ft to their deaths.\nFollowing this disaster, 2,000 fellow workers attended a meeting at which it was declared “the working-class are the best protectors of their own interests” and that if the 2,000 colleagues “would each abridge themselves of a pint of ale a week, they might raise a fund of £500 a year for the relief of widows and orphans…”\nAftermath of the deadly scaffold collapse. (Image: Sydenham & Forest Hill history).\nThe ten men were buried together nearby at St Bartholomew’s church, Sydenham (where their shared grave can still be seen), the funeral attended by 1,000 mourners.\n*\nA new park for London\nIn June 1854 and with Queen Victoria in attendance, the relocated Crystal Palace once again opened its doors to an eager public.\nThe Crystal Palace at its new home in Sydenham.\nThe new location was well connected with two purpose built railway stations; Crystal Palace Low Level on the park’s southern side (still open today) and Crystal Palace High Level.\nCrystal Palace Station (originally Crystal Palace Low Level. Image: Wikipedia)\nOriginally located on the western edge of the park, the High Level station closed in 1954 and has long since vanished, the site now covered by modern housing.\nCrystal Palace High Level station, 1865. (Image: London Illustrated News).\nIf you look carefully however, a few remnants of the old station can still be glimpsed. Alongside the new homes, just below Crystal Palace Parade, you’ll find a long retaining wall, which once run parallel to the station.\nOld retaining wall on Spinney Gardens.\nIf you peer over the opposite side of Crystal Palace Parade, you’ll spot the dilapidated remains of a once ornate subway which provided a direct walkway between the station and the palace itself.\nAriel view of the derelict subway (please note: there is no public access. Image: Google).\n*\nFor those who wished to travel to the attraction by road, accommodation for three hundred horses-a sort of equine garage- was provided at the ‘Paxton Stables’, located behind the nearby Woodman Inn on Westow Hill, where your steed could rest for the price of one shilling and sixpence; “including a feed of corn and all other expenses.”\nToday, ‘Joanna’s’ restaurant stands on the site of the old pub, although the cobbled road which led into to the horse facility can still be seen.\nSite of the old ‘Woodman’ Inn. The cobbled road led to ‘Paxton’s Stables’.\n*\nPark of delights\nInside the rebooted Crystal Palace there was a stunning amount for visitors to indulge in, with galleries showcasing art and culture from across the ages; Greek, Egyptian, Roman (including a court dedicated to the doomed town of Pompeii), Italian renaissance, Byzantine, Medieval and much more.\nThe Egyptian Court.\nThe Pompeian Court\nThere were also galleries for musical instruments, fabrics, sculpture and various other modern technologies.\nThe surrounding gardens provided even more delights, with impressive arrays of flora, a park showcasing large dinosaur models (more of which in part two) and a system of powerful fountains which, when first inaugurated, were capable of firing jets of water 200ft into the air.\nThis impressive aquatic display was powered by two mighty water towers; each sanding 282 ft. high- 107 ft. taller than Nelson’s Column and designed by legendary engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel.\nBrunel’s Crystal Palace water towers.\nTo keep the fountains operating at such levels, the towers were required to deal with a colossal 120,000 gallons of water per minute. However, it soon became apparent that the structures were unable to cope with such force and, fearing that the towers may rupture, the park’s owners had little choice but to wind the fountains down.\n*\nMore successful of the outdoor features was the Pneumatic Railway; a short, experimental line linking one park gate to another.\nCrystal Palace Pneumatic Railway.\nThe system consisted of an airtight pipe, sunk halfway into the ground, through which a single carriage was puffed from one end to the other- rather like a giant pea shooter.\nMany visitors paid a few pence to ride this novelty but despite its popularity the railway remained open to the public for just one year. Its quick disappearance has since led to many an urban legend suggesting that the Victorian railcar lies buried somewhere deep beneath the park…\n*\nFor the first thirty years at its new location, the Crystal Palace thrived, attracting an average of two million visitors per year.\nCountless exhibitions were held; dog and cat shows, livestock shows, photography exhibitions, acrobatic displays, circuses, musical concerts and so on.\nA selection of Crystal Palace dog show winners… (Image: London Illustrated News).\nFirework extravaganzas were also popular and heads of state from across the globe came to enjoy the delights of the glistening landmark.\nIn 1911, the complex staged its biggest event ever; The Festival of Empire in which “representations of possessions beyond the seas”- such as Indian tea plantations, Australian vineyards and South African gold mines- sprang up around the park like a miniature, global village.\nTo help visitors access these dioramas, organizers laid down ‘The Red Route’; a mile and a half long electric railway with stations for each country.\nThe ‘Red Route’ line running past a mock-up of an Indian tea plantation.\nInto the 20th century\nDespite such extravagance, the Crystal Palace itself was struggling financially.\nSince the turn of the century, the 1850s building- which it must be remembered had originally been designed to stand for a matter of months- was growing increasingly shabby.\nOver the past decades, it had suffered fire and storm damage. Random panes of glass would often become loose and drop out and the framework required constant painting. The building’s vast size was proving too costly to maintain and, shortly after the Festival of Empire, the Crystal Palace was declared bankrupt.\nWar and a new lease of life\nEventually bailed out by the Earl of Plymouth, the huge venue stumbled back to its feet, making a few pounds on the side with newly installed banks of slot machines.\nAnother innovation was created by a chap called Edmund Dangerfield (editor of The Motor magazine) who, in one of the palace’s wings, set up the world’s very first museum dedicated to the motor-car.\nThe world’s first motor museum at Crystal Palace (image: National Motor Museum).\nFollowing the outbreak of WWI, the Crystal Palace and its surrounding park were closed to the public and commandeered by the military; the facilities being used to train 125,000 servicemen.\nDue to the war emergency, the cars from Dangerfield’s motor museum were given little consideration; with those that could not be returned to their original donors being hastily dumped on waste ground near Charing Cross.\n*\nAt the conclusion of the Great War the Crystal Palace found another role as a huge demob centre.\nOnce its duties to King and country were over, the attraction experienced a brief renaissance thanks to James Buckland; the newly installed manager who loved the Victorian icon so much that he’d named his daughter ‘Chrystal’.\nDuring this period, the Crystal Palace provided a home for the very first incarnation of the Imperial War Museum; the weapons on display illustrating the horror of trench warfare which was still very fresh in people’s minds.\nThe Imperial War Museum at Crystal Palace, early 1920s (Image: Imperial War Museum).\nThe Imperial War Museum remained at the Palace until 1924 before moving onto South Kensington and then Lambeth, where it has remained since 1936.\nIn the early 1930s, the Crystal Palace played an important role in the early history of television when the Scottish inventor, John Logie Baird decided to move his studio onto the premises, using Brunel’s two old water towers as masts for his antennas.

                "Dustin Lee Hoffman (born August 8, 1937) is an American actor and a director, with a career in film, television, and theatre since 1960. \n\nHoffman has been known for his versatile portrayals of antiheroes and vulnerable characters.  He won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1980 for Kramer vs. Kramer, and in 1989 for Rain Man.\n\nWidely considered one of the finest actors in history, Hoffman first drew critical praise for starring in the play, Eh?, for which he won a Theatre World Award and a Drama Desk Award. This achievement was soon followed by his breakthrough 1967 film role as Benjamin Braddock, the title character in The Graduate. Since that time, Hoffman's career has largely been focused on the cinema, with sporadic returns to television and to the stage. \n\nHoffman's notable films include: Midnight Cowboy, Little Big Man, Straw Dogs, Papillon, Lenny, Marathon Man, All the President's Men, Kramer vs. Kramer, Tootsie, Rain Man, Hook, and Wag the Dog.  He made his directorial debut in 2012, with Quartet.\n\nAlong with 2 Academy Award wins, Hoffman has been nominated for 5 additional Academy Awards, and he was nominated for 13 Golden Globes, winning 6 (including an honorary award). He has won 4 BAFTAs, 3 Drama Desk Awards, a Genie Award, and an Emmy Award. \n\nHoffman received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1999, and the Kennedy Center Honors Award in 2012. \n\nEarly life\n\nHoffman was born on August 8, 1937 in Los Angeles, California, the second son of Lillian (née Gold; 1909-1982) and Harry Hoffman (1908-1988). His father worked as a prop supervisor (set decorator) at Columbia Pictures before becoming a furniture salesman.  \n\nHoffman was named after stage and silent screen actor, Dustin Farnum. His older brother, Ronald, is a lawyer and economist. Hoffman is Jewish, from an Ashkenazi family of immigrants from the Russian Empire, Poland, and Romania (the family's surname was spelled \"Goikhman\" in the Russian Empire).    His upbringing was non-religious, and he has said, \"I don’t have any memory of celebrating holidays growing up that were Jewish\", and that he had \"realized\" he was Jewish at around age 10.   \n\nHoffman graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1955 and enrolled at Santa Monica College with the intention of studying medicine. He left after a year to join the Pasadena Playhouse,  although when he told his family about his career goal, his Aunt Pearl warned him \"You can't be an actor. You are not good-looking enough.\"  He also took classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly work\n\nHoffman initially hoped to become a classical pianist, having studied piano during much of his youth and in college. While at Santa Monica College, he also took an acting class, which he assumed would be easy, and \"caught the acting bug.\" He recalls: \"I just was not gifted in music. I did not have an ear.\" Now an aspiring actor, he spent the next ten years doing odd jobs, being unemployed, and struggling to get any available acting roles.\n\nHis first acting role was at the Pasadena Playhouse, alongside future Academy Award-winner, Gene Hackman.  After two years there, Hackman headed for New York City, with Hoffman soon following. Hoffman, Hackman and Robert Duvall lived together in the 1960s, all three of them focused on finding acting jobs.    Hackman remembers, \"The idea that any of us would do well in films simply didn't occur to us. We just wanted to work.\" During this period, Hoffman got occasional television bit parts, including commercials but, needing income, he briefly left acting to teach.\n\nIn 1960, Hoffman was cast in a role in an Off-Broadway production and followed with a walk-on role in a Broadway production in 1961. Hoffman then studied at Actors Studio and became a dedicated method actor. Sidney W. Pink, a producer and 3D-movie pioneer, discovered him in one of his off-Broadway roles and cast him in Madigan's Millions. Through the early and mid-1960s, Hoffman made appearances in television shows and movies, including Naked City, The Defenders and Hallmark Hall of Fame. His first critical success was in the play Eh?, by Henry Livings, which had its US premiere at the Circle in the Square Downtown on October 16, 1966.\n\nHoffman made his film debut in The Tiger Makes Out in 1967, alongside Eli Wallach. In 1967, immediately after wrapping up principal filming on The Tiger Makes Out, Hoffman flew from New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, where he directed productions of William Gibson's Two for the Seesaw and William Saroyan's The Time of Your Life for the Fargo-Moorhead Community Theatre. The $1,000 he received for the eight-week contract was all he had to hold him over until the funds from the movie materialized. \n\n1960s: The Graduate, Midnight Cowboy, John and Mary \n\nIn 1967, director Mike Nichols cast Hoffman in The Graduate (1967), his first major role, for which he received an Academy Award nomination. Hoffman played the character of Benjamin Braddock, who returns to his wealthy parents' home in California after graduating from college. Confused about what to do with his life, he is seduced into having an affair with Mrs. Robinson, an alcoholic and a neurotic, and the wife of his father's business partner.\n\nAlthough Life magazine joked that \"if Dustin Hoffman's face were his fortune, he'd be committed to a life of poverty\",  The Graduate was a gigantic box-office hit for Embassy Pictures, making Hoffman a major new star at the same time. The film received near-unanimous good reviews. Time magazine called Hoffman \"a symbol of youth\" who represented \"a new breed of actors.\" The film's screenwriter, Buck Henry, notes that Hoffman's character made conventional good looks no longer necessary on screen:\n\nHoffman biographer Jeff Lenburg adds that \"newspapers across the country were deluged with thousands of letters from fans,\" with one example published in the New York Times: \"I identified with Ben...I thought of him as a spiritual brother. He was confused about his future and about his place in the world, as I am. It's a film one digs, rather than understands intellectually.\"Lenburg, Jeff. Dustin Hoffman: Hollywood's Antihero, St. Martin's Press (1983)\n\nTurner Classic Movies critic Rob Nixon notes that Hoffman represented \"a new generation of actors.\" He credits Hoffman with breaking \"the mold of the traditional movie star and brought to their roles a new candor, ethnicity, and eagerness to dive deep into complex, even unlikable characters.\"[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18530/The-Graduate/articles.html The Graduate], Turner Classic Movies Nixon expands on the significance of the film to Hoffman's career: \"In The Graduate, he created a lasting resonance as Ben Braddock that made him an overnight sensation and set him on the road to becoming one of our biggest stars and most respected actors.\"\n\nHoffman, however, mostly credits director Mike Nichols for taking a great risk in giving him, a relative unknown, the starring role: \"I don't know of another instance of a director at the height of his powers who would take a chance and cast someone like me in that part. It took tremendous courage.\"Kasher, Sam. Vanity Fair, March 2008\n\nCritic Sam Kashner observed strong similarities between Hoffman's character and that of Nichols when he previously acted with Elaine May in the comedy team of Nichols and May. \"Just close your eyes and you'll hear a Mike Nichols—Elaine May routine in any number of scenes.\"  Buck Henry also noticed that \"Dustin picked up all these Nichols habits, which he used in the character. Those little noises he makes are straight from Mike,\" he says.\n\nAfter completing The Graduate, Hoffman turned down most of the film roles offered to him, preferring to go back to New York and continue performing in live theater. He returned to Broadway to appear in the title role of the musical, Jimmy Shine. Hoffman won a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance.\n\nHe was then offered the lead in Midnight Cowboy (1969), which he accepted partly to prove many critics were wrong about his acting range and the variety of characters he could portray. As author and critic Peter Biskind explains, \"it was the very contrast between his preppy character in The Graduate, and Ratso Rizzo\" that appealed to Hoffman. \"I had become troubled,\" recalls Hoffman, \"by the reviews that I read of The Graduate, that I was not a character actor, which I like to think of myself as. It hurt me. Some of the stuff in the press was brutal.\" Critics assumed that director Mike Nichols got lucky by finding a typical actor with average acting ability to play the part of Benjamin Braddock.\n\nJohn Schlesinger, who would direct Midnight Cowboy and was seeking lead actors, held that same impression. Hoffman's performance  as a button-down college graduate and track star was so convincing to Schlesinger, \"he seemed unable to comprehend the fact that he was acting,\" notes Biskind. To help the director, whom he had never met, overcome that false impression, Hoffman met him in Times Square dressed as a homeless person, wearing a dirty raincoat, his hair slicked back and with an unshaven face. Schlesinger was sold, admitting, \"I've only seen you in the context of The Graduate, but you'll do quite well.\"\n\nMidnight Cowboy premiered in theaters across the United States in May 1969. For his acting, Hoffman received his second Oscar nomination and the film won Best Picture. In 1994, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.    Biskind considers Hoffman's acting a major accomplishment:\n\nAlso in 1969, Hoffman co-starred with Mia Farrow in John and Mary. He received a 1970 BAFTA Award as Best Actor, although the film received mixed reviews.  He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award as Best Actor.\n\n1970s: Lenny, All the President's Men, Marathon Man, Kramer vs. Kramer\n\nThis was followed by his role in Little Big Man (1970), where Jack Crabb, his character, ages from teenager to a 121-year-old man. The film was widely praised by critics, but was overlooked for an award except for a supporting nomination for Chief Dan George. Hoffman continued to appear in major films over the next few years. Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? (1971), Straw Dogs (also 1971), and Papillon (1973).\n\nHoffman next starred in Lenny (1974), for which he was again nominated for Best Actor. Lenny was based on the life of stand-up comedian, Lenny Bruce, who died at age 40, and was notable for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. Expectations were high that Hoffman would win an Oscar for his portrayal, especially after his similar role in Midnight Cowboy. Film critic Katharine Lowry speculates that director Bob Fosse \"never gave him a chance\" to go far enough into developing the character. \"We never understand what, besides the drugs he injected, made him tick like a time bomb,\" she says. \n\nHowever, notes author Paul Gardner, \"directing Lenny, his most ambitious project, exhausted Fosse emotionally and physically. It turned his life inside out,\" with shooting days often lasting 10 to 12 hours:\"Gardner, Paul. \"Bob Fosse Off His Toes\", New York magazine, Dec. 16, 1974\n\nHoffman initially turned the part down: \"I didn't think the script was strong enough and I wasn't sure I was the one to play the role.\" While considering the part, he read Lenny Bruce's autobiography and looked at films with Bruce performing stand-up to live audiences. \"I began to feel an affinity with him, a realization that there was a lot of Lenny Bruce in me. My wife felt it too.\"Meryman, Richard. \"Interview with Dustin Hoffman,\" Playboy, April 1975 \"I realized that I'd have to make use of my own spontaneity, because he was so spontaneous. And I admired his guts. . . . That intimacy is what an actor tries to get. . . . It occurred to me that if I had known him, I would have wanted us to be friends. . . . and he was a provocateur, and I love to provoke.\" Movie critic Judith Crist gave Hoffman credit for the ultimate success of the film:\n\nLenny was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. \n\nAll the President's Men (1976) was made less than two years after the Watergate scandal, and starred Hoffman and Robert Redford as the real life journalists, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, respectively. Based on actual events, Hoffman and Redford play Washington Post reporters who uncover a break-in at the Watergate Hotel and end up investigating a political scandal that reaches all the way to the presidency. The film, as earlier ones, had Hoffman take on a dramatically different character than his previous one (as Lenny Bruce). Author James Morrison compares the two roles: \"As Lenny Bruce in Lenny (1974), Hoffman plays a martyr to the cause of establishment oppression, while in All the President's Men, he plays a reporter exposing presidential malfeasance.\" \n\nVincent Canby of the New York Times described the film as \"a spellbinding detective story.\" \"The strength of the movie\", he added, was \"the virtually day-to-day record of the way Bernstein and Woodward conducted their investigations.\"Noble, William. Presidential Power on Trial: From Watergate to All the President's Men, Enslow Publishers (2009) p. 99 The characters portrayed by Hoffman and Redford shared the rank of No. 27 Hero on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list, while Entertainment Weekly ranked All the President's Men as one of the 25 \"Powerful Political Thrillers\".\n\nHoffman next starred in Marathon Man (1976), a film based on William Goldman's novel of the same name, opposite Laurence Olivier and Roy Scheider.  Its director, John Schlesinger also directed Hoffman in Midnight Cowboy in 1969. Described as \"Schlesinger's thriller,\" by author Gene D. Phillips, Hoffman plays the hero, Babe Levy, a part-time long-distance runner and graduate student, who suddenly finds himself being pursued by a fugitive Nazi.  To put himself in the mindset of someone under severe emotional distress, rather than simply acting, Hoffman did not sleep for days at a time and let his body become disheveled and unhealthy. \n\nGoldman describes his inspiration for the novel: \"What if someone close to you was something totally different from what you thought? In the story, Hoffman thinks his brother (Roy Scheider) is a businessman where the reality is that the man is a spy, who has been involved with the Nazi, Szell.\"  However, Hoffman remembers a serious disagreement he had with Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay, about how the story ends:\n\nHoffman's next roles were less successful. He opted out of directing Straight Time (1978), but starred as a thief. His next film, Michael Apted's Agatha (1979), was with Vanessa Redgrave as Agatha Christie.\n\nHoffman next starred in Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) co-starring Meryl Streep and directed by Robert Benton. The film tells the story of a married couple's divorce and its impact on everyone involved, including the couple's young son. Hoffman won his first Academy Award, and the film also received the Best Picture honor, plus the awards for Best Supporting Actress (Streep) and Best Director.\n\nThe film required Hoffman to change his attitude, from being a \"desensitized advertising art director\" into becoming a \"responsive and concerned daddy\" after his wife (Streep) walks out on him and their six-year-old son, Billy. Hoffman, during the making of the movie, was also going through his own divorce after a ten-year first marriage. Hoffman has said, \"Giving myself permission not only to be present but to be a father was a kind of epiphany for me at that time, that I could get to through my work. . . . I got closer to being a father by playing a father. That's very painful to say.\" The role also reminded him of his own love of children in general:\n\nBenton's directing has been praised by Hoffman, who credits him for inspiring the emotional level supporting many scenes: \"Perfect directors make you emotional. On Kramer vs. Kramer, Robert Benton made me emotional. He was pulling so hard for me. When I didn't think I could do a scene again I'd say, \"I can't give it to you, I haven't got it.\" Then he'd just get this look on his face and roll the camera and I'd say, \"Okay, this is yours.\" That's what he made you want to do for him—to give him one.\"Orth, Maureen. \"Benton vs. Benton\", New York magazine, Dec. 24, 1979\n\n1980s: Tootsie, Death of a Salesman, Rain Man, Family Business\n\nIn Tootsie (1982), Hoffman portrays Michael Dorsey, a struggling actor who finds himself dressing up as a woman to land a role on a soap opera. His co-star was Jessica Lange. Tootsie earned ten Academy Award nominations, including Hoffman's fifth nomination.\n\nUnder direction by Sydney Pollack, Hoffman's role demanded \"a steady bombardment of opposites—edgy then funny, romantic then realistic, soft then quivering.\"  To film critic David Denby, Hoffman's character \"embodies vulnerability and drive in perfect proportion. He has the knack of making everything he does seem perilous, and so audiences feel protective of him and root for him.\"  Hoffman's acting was made more difficult than necessary, however, as he was not given the rehearsal time Pollock promised:\n\nIn 1984, Hoffman starred as Willy Loman in the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's play, Death of a Salesman  He reprised his role in a TV movie of the same name, for which he won the 1985 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor along with a Golden Globe.\n\nHoffman first read the play at age 16, but today considers the story much like his own: \"It was a blueprint of my family. I was the loser, the flunky, and my brother, a high-school varsity football player, was Biff.\"[http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-03-2009/dustin_hoffman.html \"Just Dustin\"], AARP Magazine, March/April 2009 Author Marie Brenner notes that Hoffman \"has been obsessed with the play\" throughout his career: \"For years he has wanted to be Willy Loman; when he discovered that Arthur Miller was his neighbor in Connecticut, they began to talk about it in earnest.\"Brenner, Marie. \"Rebirth of a Salesman\", New York magazine, March 26, 1984. pp. 32-36 For Hoffman, the story also left a deep emotional impact from the time he first read it:\n\nHoffman rehearsed for three weeks with the play's original star, Lee J. Cobb, and remembers seeing his stage performance: \"I'll never forget that period in my life. It was so vivid, so intense, watching Lee J. Cobb and his sixteen-inch guns as Willy. God, how I think about what I saw on that stage!\" Brenner adds that Hoffman \"has been training like a boxer for the role that so exhausted Cobb he had to be replaced after four months.\" The original play was directed by Elia Kazan, who Hoffman considers \"the perfect director, the best there ever was. . . . God, I would have done anything to have worked with Kazan.\"\n\nHoffman's worst film failure was Elaine May's Ishtar (1987), co-starring Warren Beatty, who also produced it. Hoffman and Beatty play two down-and-out singer-songwriters who travel to Morocco for a nightclub gig and get caught up in foreign intrigue. Much of the movie was filmed in Africa. The film faced severe production problems, mostly related to its $55 million cost, and received overwhelmingly negative reviews. However, Hoffman and Beatty liked the film's final cut and tried to defend it.   Hoffman and Beatty were unaffected by the flop, and Ishtar became a cult film. Quentin Tarantino, for one, has called it one of his favorite movies, partly due to the humorous lyrics of the songs written by Paul Williams. Hoffman describes why he loves the film:\n\nNext came director Barry Levinson's Rain Man (1988), where Hoffman starred as an autistic savant, opposite Tom Cruise. Levinson, Hoffman and Cruise worked for two years on the film, and Hoffman's performance gained him his second Academy Award. Behind Hoffman's motivation for doing the film, he has said, \"Deep inside, Rain Man is about how autistic we all are.\" In preparation for the part, Hoffman spent two years befriending autistic people, which included taking them bowling and to fast food restaurants. \"It fed my obsession,\" he has stated. \n\nHoffman had worked at the New York Psychiatric Institute, affiliated with Columbia University, when he was 21. \"It was a great experience for me,\" he has said. \"All my life I had wanted to get inside a prison or a mental hospital. . . . I wanted to get inside where behavior, human behavior, was so exposed. All the things the rest of us were feeling and stopping up were coming out of these people.\" He used that experience to help him develop the character of Raymond Babbitt, a high-functioning autistic savant, yet a person who critic David Denby described as \"a strangely shuttered genius.\"Denby, David. New York magazine, Jan. 2, 1989 pp. 45-46 Hoffman created certain character traits for Raymond. Denby noted: \"Hoffman, looking suddenly older and smaller, has developed a small shuffling walk for Raymond, with shoulder bent. His eyes don't make contact with anyone else's, and he flattens his voice to a dry nasal bark.\"\n\nRain Man won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hoffman, and Best Director for Barry Levinson. Having worked closely with Hoffman for two years on filming, Levinson offered some opinions about his skill as an actor:\n\nAfter Rain Man, Hoffman appeared with Sean Connery and Matthew Broderick in Family Business (1989), directed by Sidney Lumet. The story centers on the estrangement between Vito (Hoffman), a middle-age man trying to succeed in a legitimate business, and his \"hopelessly corrupt but charming father,\" Jesse (Connery). Critics were mostly not impressed with the story, although the individual performances were praised, especially Connery's.\n\nBecause of their different acting styles and nationalities, some industry writers thought Connery and Hoffman might not work well together as close family members. \"To the surprise of many,\" note Connery biographers Lee Pfeiffer and Lisa Philip, \"the two superstars developed an immediate rapport and chemistry that translates onto the screen.\" And Lumet remembered: \"Sean is extremely disciplined and Dustin is very improvisational, all over the place with his lines. I didn't know where it would end up, but Sean met Dustin improvisation for improvisation, and a great deal of richness and humor came out of it.\"Pfeiffer, Lee, and Philip, Lisa. The Films of Sean Connery, Citadel Press (2001) p. 231\n\n1990s: Dick Tracy, Hook, Outbreak, Mad City, Wag the Dog\n\nIn 1991, Hoffman voiced substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom in The Simpsons episode \"Lisa's Substitute\", under the pseudonym Sam Etic. As a reference to this episode, during the episode featuring the Itchy & Scratchy movie, Lisa claims that Dustin Hoffman had a cameo in that movie but didn't use his real name.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Hoffman appeared in many large, studio films, such as Dick Tracy (1990) (where his Ishtar co-star Beatty plays the titular character), Hero (1992) and Billy Bathgate (1991) co-starring with Nicole Kidman who was nominated for a Golden Globe). Hoffman also played the title role of Captain Hook in Steven Spielberg's Hook (also 1991), earning a Golden Globe nomination, and the narrator in Dr. Seuss Video Classics: Horton Hears a Who! (also 1992); in Hook, Hoffman's costume was so heavy that he had to wear an air-conditioned suit under it.\n\nHoffman played the lead role in Outbreak (1995), alongside Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Donald Sutherland. In the film, Hoffman is a medical doctor who uncovers a newly discovered Ebola-like virus which came to the U.S. from Africa in an infected monkey. Hoffman races to stop the virus's spread and find a vaccine before it becomes a worldwide pandemic with no cure.\n\nThe movie is described by critic Roger Ebert as \"one of the great scare stories of our time, the notion that deep in the uncharted rain forests, deadly diseases are lurking, and if they ever escape their jungle homes and enter the human bloodstream, there will be a new plague the likes of which we have never seen.\"  Critic David Denby credits Hoffman with giving the movie much of its thriller-like quality:\n\nFollowing that, he appeared in the 1996 revenge-drama/legal-thriller Sleepers (1996) with Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, and Kevin Bacon.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Hoffman starred in—and was deeply involved in the production of—David Mamet's American Buffalo (also 1996), and an early effort of film editor Kate Sanford. In 1997, Hoffman starred opposite John Travolta in the Costa Gavras film Mad City.\n\nHoffman gained his seventh Academy Award nomination for his performance in Wag The Dog (1997), in a role that allowed Hoffman the chance to work with both Robert De Niro and Denis Leary. The movie is a black comedy film  produced and directed by Barry Levinson, who also directed Hoffman in Rain Man in 1988.\n\nThe story takes place a few days before a presidential election, where a Washington, D.C. spin doctor (De Niro) distracts the electorate from a sex scandal by hiring a Hollywood film producer (Hoffman) to construct a fake war with Albania. Hoffman, as a caricature of real life producer Robert Evans, according to some, \"gives the kind of wonderfully funny performance that is liable to win prizes, especially since its mixture of affection and murderous parody is so precise. Stanley (Hoffman) conducts business meetings in tennis clothes or in robe and slippers,\" notes critic Janet Maslin. \n\nHe next appeared in another Barry Levinson film, the science fiction psychological thriller, Sphere (1998), opposite Sharon Stone.\n\nIn 1999, Hoffman received the AFI Life Achievement Award and recalls the emotional impact that receiving the award had on him:\n\n2000s: Finding Neverland, Meet the Fockers, Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium\n\nHoffman next appeared in Moonlight Mile (2002), followed by Confidence (2003) opposite Edward Burns, Andy García and Rachel Weisz. Hoffman finally had a chance to work with Gene Hackman in Gary Fleder's Runaway Jury (also 2003), an adaptation of John Grisham's bestselling novel.\n\nHoffman played theater owner Charles Frohman in the J. M. Barrie historical fantasia Finding Neverland (2004), costarring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. In director David O. Russell's I Heart Huckabees (also 2004), Hoffman appeared opposite Lily Tomlin as an existential detective team member.\n\nSeven years after his nomination for Wag the Dog, Hoffman got another opportunity to perform again with Robert De Niro, co-starring with Barbra Streisand and Ben Stiller in the 2004 comedy Meet the Fockers, a sequel to Meet the Parents (2000). Hoffman won the 2005 MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance. In 2005, he voiced a horse in Racing Stripes, and appeared in cameo roles in Andy García's The Lost City and on the final episode of HBO sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasms fifth season. Hoffman appeared in Stranger than Fiction (2006), played the perfumer Giuseppe Baldini in Tom Tykwer's film Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (also 2006), and had a cameo in the same year's The Holiday.\n\nIn 2007, he was featured in an advertising campaign for Australian telecommunications company Telstra's Next G network,  appeared in the 50 Cent video \"Follow My Lead\" as a psychiatrist, and played the title character in the family film Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. In 2008, although he was reluctant to perform in an animated feature film (Although he had previously performed voices in a version of The Point! and in an episode of The Simpsons), Hoffman had a prominent role as Shifu in the acclaimed film Kung Fu Panda, which was praised in part for his comedic chemistry with Jack Black (whom he tutored in acting for an important scene) and his character's poignantly complex relationship with the story's villain. He later won the Annie Award for Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for Kung Fu Panda and has continued into the role in the franchise's subsequent filmed productions outside of the franchise's television series. He next voiced Roscuro in The Tale of Despereaux.\n\nAs the title character in Last Chance Harvey, Hoffman acted with co-star Emma Thompson in the story of two lonely people who tentatively forge a relationship over the course of three days. Director Joel Hopkins notes that Hoffman was a perfectionist and self-critical: \"He often wanted to try things stripped down, because less is sometimes more. He worries about every little detail.\"\n\n2010s: Barney's Version, Kung Fu Panda, Little Fockers, Quartet\n\nHe appears in Little Fockers, the critically panned yet financially successful 2010 sequel to Meet the Fockers.  However, his character plays a significantly smaller role than in the previous installment. In 2011, Hoffman reprised his role as Shifu in the commercially and critically successful animated film Kung Fu Panda 2.\n\nHoffman starred in the HBO horse-racing drama Luck, as a man involved in bookmaking and casino operations. Luck was cancelled in March 2012 after three horses died on set.  Hoffman also directed Quartet, a BBC Films comedy starring Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay. \n\nIn 2012, Hoffman's audiobook recording of Jerzy Kosinski's Being There was released at Audible.com. His performance was nominated for a 2013 Audie Award for Best Solo Narration – Male.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHoffman married Anne Byrne in May 1969.[http://www.tribute.ca/people/Dustin+Hoffman/3813 Dustin Hoffman] at Tribute.ca. Retrieved January 23, 2008. Hoffman adopted Karina (b. 1966), Byrne's child from a previous marriage, and with Byrne had daughter Jenna (born October 15, 1970). In 1970, Hoffman and Byrne were living in Greenwich Village in a building next door to a townhouse occupied by members of the Weathermen, when a bomb was accidentally detonated in the townhouse's basement, killing three people. In the 2002 documentary The Weather Underground, Hoffman can be seen standing in the street during the aftermath of the explosion.    The couple divorced in 1980.\n\nHe married businesswoman Lisa Gottsegen Hoffman in October 1980; they have four children – Jacob Edward (born March 20, 1981), Rebecca Lillian (b. March 17, 1983), Maxwell Geoffrey (born August 30, 1984), and Alexandra Lydia (born October 27, 1987). Hoffman has two grandchildren. In an interview, he said that all of his children from his second marriage had bar or bat mitzvahs and that he is a more observant Jew now than when he was younger; he has also lamented that he is not fluent in Hebrew. \n\nA political liberal, Hoffman has long supported the Democratic Party and Ralph Nader. In 1997, he was one of a number of Hollywood stars and executives to sign an open letter to then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl protesting the treatment of Scientologists in Germany, which was published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune.Bonfante, Jordan; van Voorst, Bruce (February 10, 1997. \"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985883-1,00.html Does Germany Have Something Against These Guys?]\", Time\n\nIn 2009, he received the freedom of the Italian city Ascoli Piceno for being there during 1972 to shoot the movie Alfredo, Alfredo by Pietro Germi, where he played the role of Alfredo Sbisà.\n\nDustin Hoffman received Kennedy Center Honors in 2012, with the following commendation: \"Dustin Hoffman's unyielding commitment to the wide variety of roles he plays has made him one of the most versatile and iconoclastic actors of this or any other generation\". \n\nHoffman was successfully treated for cancer in 2013. \n\nFilmography and awards"

                "Orion Constellation: Facts About the Hunter\nOrion Constellation: Facts About the Hunter\nBy Kim Ann Zimmermann |\nJuly 19, 2012 04:46pm ET\nMORE\nWhile the Orion constellation is named after the hunter in Greek mythology, it is anything but stealthy. Orion, which is located on the celestial equator, is one of the most prominent and recognizable constellations in the sky and can be seen throughout the world.\nOrion is the brightest and most beautiful of the winter constellations. Some of its stars, including Betelgeuse and Rigel, are among the brightest stars.\nCredit: Starry Night Software\nLocating Orion the Hunter\nOrion is clearly visible in the night sky from November to February. Orion is in the southwest sky if you are in the Northern Hemisphere or the northwestern sky if you are in the Southern Hemisphere. It is best seen between latitudes 85 and -75 degrees. Its right ascension is 5 hours, and its declination is 5 degrees.\nAlnilam, Mintaka and Alnitak, which form Orion’s belt, are the most prominent stars in the Orion constellation. Betelgeuse, the second brightest star in Orion, establishes the right shoulder of the hunter. Bellatrix serves as Orion's left shoulder.\nThe Orion Nebula —a formation of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases rather than a star—is the middle \"star\" in Orion’s sword, which hangs off of Orion's Belt. The Horsehead Nebula is also nearby.\nOther stars in the constellation include Hatsya, which establishes the tip of Orion's sword that hangs off the belt, and Meissa, which forms Orion's head. Saiph serves as Orion's right knee. Rigel forms the hunter's left knee.\nWith one exception, all of the main stars in Orion are bright young blue giants or supergiants, ranging in distance from Bellatrix (243 light-years) to Alnilam (1,359 light-years). The Orion Nebula is farther away than any of the naked eye stars at a distance of about 1,600 light-years. One light-year is the distance light travels in a single year, about 6 trillion miles (10 trillion kilometers).\nThe exception is the star Betelgeuse, which is a red giant and one of the largest stars known. It is also the only star in the sky large enough and close enough to have been imaged as a disk in the Hubble Space Telescope. Observers with a keen eye should be able to see the difference in color between Betelgeuse and all the other stars in Orion. [ Space Photos: Orion Nebula & Other Stunning Views ]\nThe stars Alnilam, Mintaka and Alnitak form Orion’s belt.\nCredit: Martin Mutti, Astronomical Image Data Archive\nMythology\nThere are several versions of the myth of Orion, but one of the more common iterations is that Orion proclaimed himself to be the greatest hunter in the world, much to the dismay of Hera, the wife of Zeus. She had a scorpion kill him, and Zeus put Orion into the sky as consolation. In another version, Orion is blinded for raping Merope, a granddaughter of the god Dionysis. He has to travel East to seek the sun's rays to recover his sight.\nWhile the name Orion is steeped in Greek mythology, many cultures have been influenced by the story of this constellation. Orion has also associated with the Egyptian Pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty called Unas. In Hungary, Orion is known as (magic) Archer (Íjász), or Scyther (Kaszás). Scandinavians refer to \"Orion's belt\" as Frigg's Distaff.\n— Kim Ann Zimmermann\nConstellations ancient and modern grace the skies year round. Let's see what you know about the star patterns that appear overhead every night.",
                "Constellations\nA constellation is a group of stars viewed from the Earth.  Within each group, imaginary lines to produce patterns can connect the stars.  Ancient astronomers saw in these pattern pictures of the animals and heroes of their myths that had been placed in the sky by the gods.  More than half the constellations have names that came from the Greeks and Romans, who probably got them from the Babylonians.\nThere are 88 constellations recognized by astronomers today.  The Greek astronomer Ptolemy, who lived in the 2nd century AD, named 48 constellations in a book called the Almagest, and 40 more have been added since.  The majority of Ptolemy's names have been retained.  European astronomers gave most of the others to the constellations of the southern sky in the 17th and 18th centuries.\nAlthough all the stars in the same constellation look closer together in the sky, they are not necessarily close in space because some may be much further away than others. The constellations exist purely as an accidental result of the way stars appear to us on the Earth.\nFrom one place on the Earth different constellations are seen at different times of the year.  This happens because, as well as turning on its axis, the Earth is always moving round the Sun, making one circle each year.  A constellation, which is visible during one part of the year, may appear close to the Sun six months later; it would not then appear in the night sky.  Some constellations can only be seen from the Northern Hemisphere and some only from the Southern Hemisphere.  Thus the constellation Ursa Major cannot be seen from the Southern Hemisphere, while the Southern Cross cannot be seen from the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe path of the Sun among the stars is called the ecliptic.  The twelve constellations, which lie along the ecliptic, form the Zodiac.  The other constellations are divided into those north of the Zodiac and those south of it.\nEvery one of the constellations has some special stars in it.  Here we shall mention only some of the most famous constellations and stars.  Many of the names are taken from the Greek myths.  One of the best known of all constellations is Ursa Major, the Great Bear.  Its seven brightest start form a figure which has come to have several names, such as the Plow, the Big Dipper, Charles' Wain, David's Chariot, and the Bier of Lazarus. The two stars furthest from the handle of the Plow are called the \"Pointers\", because they point at Polaris.\nThe constellation Orion is usually drawn as a hunter, whose belt is marked out by three bright stars.  The bright star above the belt, when viewed from the Northern Hemisphere is Betelgeuse (astronomical name Orionis), a yellowish-red star.  The bright white star Rigel (Orionis) is below the belt.  The positions of Betelgeuse and Rigel are reversed when Orion is viewed from the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe hunter has two dogs: the greater, Canis Major, and the lesser, Canis Minor.  The most important star in Canis Major is Sirius, the Dog Star (Canis Majoris), the brightest of all the stars we can see, and one of the nearest stars to the Sun.\nAlso near to Orion is Gemini, the Twins, one of the constellations of the Zodiac.  The two brightest stars in Gemini are the mythical twins Castor (Geminorum) and Pollux (Geminnorum).\nAnother constellation of the Zodiac is Leo, the Lion, supposed to be the lion killed by Hercules.  It contains the bright star Regulus (Leonis).  Another of Hercules' victims is Draco, the Dragon, near Polaris, supposed to be the dragon guarding the golden apples in the garden of the Hesperides.  Near by is the plowman Bootes, with the bright orange-red star Arcturus (Bootes).\nThe scorpion, which killed Orion, appears as the constellation Scorpio.  At its heart is the reddish star Antares (Scorpii), one of the largest stars known.  It is many hundred times bigger than the Sun.\nThe brightest star lying closest to the North Pole marked by Polaris is Vega (Lyrae), in the constellation Lyra, the Harp.  It has a very faint star next to it in the sky, but the two stars are not physically close to each other and only appear so from Earth.\nPerseus, his wife Andromeda, whom he saved from the sea-monster, and her parents Cepheus and Cassiopeia, are all constellations.  Cassiopeia, on the other side of Polaris from the Great Bear, is easy to recognize.  It has five bright stars forming a large W.  In Perseus is the bright Algol (Persei).  Algol means \"demon\" and the star was probably given this name by ancient peoples who discovered that it is not always of the same brightness. At regular intervals, slightly less than three days apart, it becomes fainter for a while, and then recovers its brightness.  This happens because it is really two stars going round each other, one of which is much fainter than the other; when faint star moves between the bright one and the Earth it causes a reduction in brightness.\nThe brightest stars of the famous constellation Crux, in the southern sky, appear on the flags of Australia and New Zealand.\n� 1988 Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.",
                "Orion's Belt: Stars, Facts, Location, Myths | Constellation Guide\nConstellation Guide\nConstellations: A Guide to the Night Sky\nOrion’s Belt\nby admin\nOrion’s Belt is one of the most familiar asterisms in the night sky, along with the Big Dipper and the Southern Cross .\nIt is formed by three massive, bright stars located in our galaxy, in the direction of the constellation Orion, the Hunter : Alnilam, Alnitak and Mintaka. Two of the three stars are supergiants.\nOrion’s Belt is easy to find in the night sky as it is located on the celestial equator and part of one of the most prominent stellar patterns in the northern sky, the hourglass-shaped constellation Orion. The asterism and the constellation are visible in northern latitudes from November to February.\nThe best time of year to observe the asterism is in January around 9 PM. Finding Orion’s Belt is the easiest way to locate Orion constellation , one of the best known constellations in the sky, which carries great significance across many different cultures, from Egypt to Greece and beyond.\nThe three stars of the Orion’s Belt are pretty evenly spaced and form a more or less straight line, which makes them easy to locate. Because the belt stars are so prominent in the northern sky, they are associated with a number of stories and myths. The stars are known as the Three Kings, Three Marys, Frigg’s Distaff, Three Sisters, the Weighing Beam, and by many other names in different mythologies, from the Babylonians to Egyptians and Greeks.\nOrion’s Belt stars and Flame Nebula , photo: Davide De Martin, Digitized Sky Survey, ESA, ESO, NASA FITS Liberator\nThe Greeks associated the stars with the mythical hunter Orion, with the constellations Canis Major and Canis Minor representing the hunter’s dogs and the constellation Scorpius , representing the scorpion that killed Orion, placed on the opposite end of the sky so that the two are never above the horizon at the same time.\nIn ancient Egypt, the stars of the Orion’s Belt were the symbol of Osiris, but the extent of their importance has only been speculated about. The belt stars are not perfectly aligned, and their alignment matches that of the three pyramids of Giza, while Orion’s orientation to the Milky Way matches the pyramids’ orientation to the river Nile. This has given rise to speculation that the three great pyramids were not just tombs, but also served as the pharaohs’ gateway to heaven. The constellation Orion was also associated with the Egyptian pharaoh Unas of the Fifth Dynasty.\nSTARS\nThe three bright stars that form the Orion’s Belt are Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka. The stars are believed to have formed from the same nebula in Orion constellation , and they are roughly the same age. The two stars at either end of Orion’s Belt – Alnitak and Mintaka – are actually closer together because the middle star, Alnilam, which is the brightest of the three, is also much more distant from Earth than the other two.\nThe belt stars are members of the Orion OB1b association, along with many other stars in this region, and they travel together through space. They were all formed inside the same molecular cloud about 4 million years ago.\nThe stars were collectively known by different names in different countries and cultures, including the Weighing Beam in Chinese and Al Nijād (the Belt), Al Nasak (the Line), Al Alkāt (the Golden Grains/Nuts) and Al Mīzān al Ḥaqq (the Accurate Scale Beam) in Arabic. Pre-Christian Scandinavians knew them as Friggerock (Frigg’s Distaff) or Freyja’s Distaff. In Latin America, the belt stars are known as Las Tres Marías (Spanish) or As Três Marias (Portuguese), meaning the Three Marys.\nIn Puerto Rico and the Philippines , the stars are called Los Tres Reyes Magos, referring to the Three Kings or the Biblical Magi who visited baby Jesus.\nOrion stars – Photo taken by Rogelio Bernal Andreo in October 2010 of the Orion constellation showing the surrounding nebulas of the Orion Molecular Cloud complex. Also captured is the red supergiant Betelgeuse (top left) and the famous belt of Orion composed of the OB stars Altitak, Alnilam and Mintaka. To the bottom right can be found the star Rigel. The red crescent shape is Barnard’s Loop. The photograph appeared as the Astronomy Picture of the Day on October 23, 2010.\nAlnitak, also known as ζ Orionis (Zeta Orionis) or 50 Orionis, is a triple star system located at the eastern end of the Belt of Orion. The star system is approximately 736 light years distant from Earth and over 100,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The combined apparent magnitude of the system is 1.72.\nThe name Alnitak comes from the Arabic an-niṭāq, which means “the girdle.” The name is sometimes also spelled Al Nitak or Alnitah.\nThe primary component in the Alnitak system is a close binary star composed of a blue supergiant belonging to the spectral class O9.7 Ibe and a blue dwarf with the stellar classification O9V. The supergiant has an apparent magnitude of 2.0 and an absolute magnitude of -5.25, and the dwarf has a visual magnitude of around 4 and an absolute magnitude of -3.0. The supergiant has a mass about 27 times that of the Sun and a diameter 19 times solar. It is the brightest O-class star in the sky, with a luminosity 180,000 times solar. The blue dwarf was only discovered in 1998. It has a mass about 19 times solar and a radius 7.5 times that of the Sun.\nThe third component in the Alnitak system is a 4th magnitude B0-type star which orbits the main pair every 1,500 years. There is a 9th magnitude star along the same line of sight, but it is unclear whether it is physically related to the system or just an optical companion.\nThis image, the first to be released publicly from VISTA, the world’s largest survey telescope, shows the spectacular star-forming region known as the Flame Nebula , or NGC 2024, in the constellation of Orion (the Hunter) and its surroundings. In views of this evocative object in visible light the core of the nebula is completely hidden behind obscuring dust, but in this VISTA view, taken in infrared light, the cluster of very young stars at the object’s heart is revealed. The wide-field VISTA view also includes the glow of the reflection nebula NGC 2023, just below centre, and the ghostly outline of the Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33) towards the lower right. The bright bluish star towards the right is one of the three bright stars forming the Belt of Orion. Image: ESO/J. Emerson/VISTA. Acknowledgment: Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit\nAlnitak lies near the nebulous region IC 434, whose light is blocked by the Horsehead Nebula , a famous dark nebula in Orion . Other notable deep sky objects in this region are the emission nebula NGC 2024, also known as the Flame Nebula , and the reflection nebula NGC 2023.\nAlnilam, also known as ε Orionis (Epsilon Orionis) or 46 Orionis, is the middle star of the Orion’s Belt. It is located at a distance of 1,340 light years from Earth. The star is a large blue supergiant with a visual magnitude of 1.70 and an absolute magnitude of -6.37. Alnilam is the 30th brightest star in the sky and the fourth brightest in Orion constellation , after Rigel, Betelgeuse and Bellatrix. It has the stellar classification B0 Ia and is also classified as an Alpha Cygni type variable, which is to say it is a supergiant star that exhibits non-radial pulsations, with some portions of its surface contracting while others expand.\nThe name Alnilam is derived from the Arabic an-niżām, which means “the string of pearls.”\nAlnilam may evolve into a red supergiant over the next million years and eventually end its life in a supernova explosion. The star is losing mass around 20 times more rapidly than the Sun as a result of strong stellar winds, possibly reaching up to 2,000 km/s. Alnilam has a radius 30 times that of the Sun and is 375,000 times more luminous. The star’s estimated surface temperature is 26,200 K.\nThe star is surrounded by NGC 1990, a molecular cloud turned into a reflection nebula by the light of the bright star.\nMintaka, also known as δ Orionis (Delta Orionis) or 34 Orionis, is the westernmost star of the Orion’s Belt. It is a binary star approximately 916 light years from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 2.21 and an absolute magnitude of -4.99. It is 90,000 times more luminous and 20 times more massive than the Sun. The two stars in the Mintaka system orbit each other every 5.73 days. The system is classified as an eclipsing binary.\nThe name Mintaka, pronounced MIN-ta-ka, comes from the Arabic manṭaqa, which means “the belt.”\nDelta Orionis is really a multiple star system. The main component is the binary star, one consisting of a B-type giant (B0.5III) and a smaller yet hotter O-type star (O9.5 II). There is also a magnitude 7 star located 52” away from the primary component and another fainter star in between.\nLOCATION\nOrion constellation can easily be found in the sky from November to February. For observers in the northern hemisphere, the constellation lies in the southwestern sky. For those in southern latitudes, Orion can be seen in the northwestern sky and appears to be standing on his head. The constellation’s hourglass shape is marked by the stars Betelgeuse , Bellatrix, Saiph, and Rigel, which are among the brightest stars in the night sky. Betelgeuse and Bellatrix mark the hunter’s shoulders and Saiph and Rigel mark his feet.\nOrion’s Belt and Sirius\nThe stars forming a diagonal line below the Orion’s Belt form an asterism known as Orion’s Sword. The star lying in the middle of the sword is not a star at all, but the famous Orion Nebula ( Messier 42 ), which appears as a patch of light to the naked eye on clear nights.\nTo the east, the line of the Orion’s Belt points toward Sirius , the brightest star in the sky, located in Canis Major constellation . To the west, the three stars point in the direction of Aldebaran , the brightest star in Taurus constellation , making it easy to locate the famous Pleiades ( Messier 45 ) and Hyades star clusters.\nPYRAMIDS\nThe shape of different constellations and asterisms changes over time as a result of stars not being stationary and moving through space, but the three stars of the Orion’s Belt share the same origin and have the same proper motion, which means that they travel together, with the asterism retaining a similar shape over the centuries. This means that the Orion’s Belt looked almost the same in ancient times as it does now.\nAerial photo of the Giza pyramid complex, image : © Raimond Spekking / CC BY-SA 3.0 (via Wikimedia Commons)\nIn ancient Egyptian mythology, Orion and the bright star Sirius represent Osiris and Isis. Ancient Egyptians believed that the gods descended from Sirius and the Belt of Orion, and instigated the human race.\nThe three pyramids on the Giza Plateau simulate the alignment of the three belt stars, and the air shafts inside the pyramids point directly toward Orion constellation. They are believed to be there to project the pharaoh’s soul toward Orion . While this theory remains a theory, the correspondence between the stars and the pyramids is quite remarkable.\nTEOTIHUACÁN\nA similar correspondence was discovered in the ruins of the ancient city of Teotihuacán, which lies 35 miles to the northeast of Mexico City. Two large pyramids and a temple, believed to have been built in the 2nd century BC, point directly to the Orion’s Belt and their layout mimics that of the three belt stars. The construction of the ancient city was attributed to a race of giants, the Quinametzin Giants, who were believed to have populated the world in an earlier era. The pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacán is exactly half as tall as the Great pyramid of Giza.\nOrion’s Belt: Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka, are the bright bluish stars from east to west (left to right) along the diagonal in this gorgeous cosmic vista. Otherwise known as the Belt of Orion, these three blue supergiant stars are hotter and much more massive than the Sun. They lie about 1,500 light-years away. Photo: Astrowicht",
                "The Constellation Orion – One Minute Astronomer\nby Brian Ventrudo\nOrion is perhaps the most famous of the 88 constellations in the night sky.  It’s likely the easiest to find for stargazers all over the world.  And unlike most constellations, Orion looks like its legendary namesake: a mighty hunter with a shield, a raised arm, and a sword hanging from his star-jeweled belt.\nThis time of year, for northern observers, Orion is primed for viewing moderately high in the southeastern sky about 9 p.m.  Southern observers enjoy the striking sight of Orion “upside down”, high overhead in the summer sky.\nHere’s a map to show you what Orion looks like, and how to find which of its stars is which…\nThe constellation Orion (click to enlarge)\nAfter three decades of stargazing, I’m still awestruck by the splendour of this constellation on a cold winter’s night.  No amount of observation dulls Orion’s beauty.  Glittering like a gigantic piece of celestial jewelry, it holds a number of the brightest stars in the sky.  Many of these stars formed in the great Orion star factory, an invisible mass of gas and dust that’s even now condensing into new stars.\nThe bright red-orange star marking Orion’s shoulder is called Betelguese (“BAY-tell-jewz”).  It’s a massive star that’s burned through most of its fuel, and will explode as a supernova that shines so bright, it will cast shadows by night and and be visible in our daytime for several weeks.  This explosion may happen next year, or in a million years.  No one knows for sure.\nThe brighter of the two blue-white stars marking Orion’s feet is Rigel (“RYE-jel”).  It’s much younger than Betelguese, and slightly brighter (only five stars in the entire sky outshine Rigel).  In a large backyard telescope, keen-eyed observers will notice Rigel has a faint companion star which is called Rigel B.\nThree stars lined up in a tidy row mark Orion’s Belt.  These stars are Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka.  The stars lie almost exactly on the celestial equator, an imaginary line encircling the sky which lies directly above the Earth’s equator.\nLook closely at the group of three dim stars that appear to hang off the belt.  The middle star appears fuzzy and indistinct, because it’s entangled in a mass of glowing gas and dust called the Orion Nebula where a cluster of brand-new stars are in the process of formation.  You can learn more about the nebula here…\nThat’s enough for today.  When you have a little time, go have a good look at Orion.  It’s a favorite constellation of many experienced stargazers.",
                "The Constellation Game\nCopyright Bernd Mienert. Courtesy of the Astronomical Image Data Archive .\nOrion consists of seven major stars: two for his shoulders, two for his feet,  and three for his belt. Each star has a name. Also, astronomers have  measured bright and how far away each star is.\nAstronomers measure how bright a star is with a number called magnitude. The brighter the star, the lower the magnitude. Also,  magnitude changes very fast. A difference of 5 in magnitude means a factor of 100  difference in brightness.\nThe stars to the left are magnitude 13 and 18, so they differ by a factor of 100.  Similarly, a magnitude 1 star is 100 times brighter than a magnitude 6 star.  This might seem confusing to you, but astronomers have used magnitude for thousands of years.\nAstronomers measure distance in light-years. One  light-year is the distance light travels in one year: 9,458,000,000,000 kilometers. A light-year is a long way: to go one light-year in the Space Shuttle would take you about 40,000 years!\nThe table below shows magnitudes and distances for the seven stars that make up  Orion.

                "A Tale of Two Stars: The Inside Story of Orion's Belt\nA Tale of Two Stars: The Inside Story of Orion's Belt\nBy Joe Rao, SPACE.com Skywatching Columnist |\nFebruary 14, 2012 02:43pm ET\nMORE\nOrion is the brightest and most beautiful of the winter constellations. Some of its stars, including Betelgeuse and Rigel, are among the brightest stars.\nCredit: Starry Night Software\nStanding upright and shining down upon Earth on these midwinter nights is the brightest and grandest of all the constellations: Orion, the Mighty Hunter. \nCurrently, Orion can be easily seen by skywatchers with clear weather as a star pattern standing high in the southern sky at around 8 p.m. local time.\nThree bright stars in line in the middle of a bright rectangle decorate Orion's belt , which points northward to the clusters of the Hyades and Pleiades of Taurus, and southward to the Dog Star, Sirius. Above and below the belt, we also find two immense stars, Rigel and Betelgeuse . \nRigel (the \"Left Leg of the Giant\"), is a blue-white supergiant star, one of the rarest breeds in our galaxy.  But with their enormous brilliance — up to 100,000 times as bright as the sun — blue-white supergiants remain conspicuous over great distances.\nIn contrast, red supergiants like Betelgeuse (\"The Armpit of the Giant\") are gigantic bloated globes of cooler gas. If such a star were to replace the sun in the solar system, it might extend beyond Mars' orbit. [ Gallery: The Splendor of the Orion Nebula ]\n \nStar at its prime\nRigel is one of the most intrinsically luminous of all stars and one of the hottest, apparently just reaching the prime of its life in the time span of a star and literally \"burning the candle at both ends.\" It has been computed that Rigel's luminosity is something like 57,000 times that of the sun. The star is about 773 light-years away. \nIn stark contrast, bright red Betelgeuse is near the end of its career . It is located 522 light-years away, but does not shine with a steady light. \nBetelgeuse is a \"pulsating\" star , expanding and contracting spasmodically with a diameter that varies from 550 to 920 times that of the sun, but so irregular are these pulsations that no one can predict exactly when it will expand or contract. In trying to describe Betelgeuse many years ago, Henry Neely, a lecturer at New York's Hayden Planetarium, once noted that it is \"like an old man with his strength almost entirely spent, panting in the asthmatic decrepitude of old age.\"\nStars produce their energy by fusing hydrogen into helium deep within their cores. When a star accumulates sufficient helium in its core, its energy output increases significantly, and it swells into a red giant or supergiant, like Betelgeuse. This is what Rigel will become in a few million years.\nIn such stars, the core produces successively heavier elements to balance the incessant crush of gravity. But once the core begins creating iron, a star's days are numbered; the formation of elements heavier than iron consumes rather than produces energy.\nEventually, since the core can no longer support the star's vast weight, it collapses, triggering a cataclysmic supernova explosion. Betelgeuse is in its final stage and could explode in only a few million years.\n \nSkywatcher Per-Magnus Heden wondered if the Vikings gazed at the same starry sky, which includes the constellation Orion at bottom, when he took this photo in Feb. 2011.\nCredit: P-M Hedén/TWAN",
                "Orion (constellation)\nOrion (constellation)\nMonoceros\nOrion, the Hunter, is a prominent constellation , perhaps the best-known in the sky. Its brilliant stars, on the celestial equator and visible throughout the world, make this constellation universally recognized.\nOrion is standing next to the river Eridanus with his two hunting dogs Canis Major and Canis Minor , fighting Taurus the bull. Other prey of his like Lepus the hare , is also nearby.\nTable of contents\n5 External link\nNotable features\nThe constellation is extremely rich in bright stars and in deep-sky objects. Here are some of its stars:\nHeka is Orion's head.\nBetelgeuse (α), at its right shoulder, is a red star, larger than the orbit of Venus . The title of α-star was falsely awarded to this star; it should have been given to Rigel instead, which is somewhat brighter. Betelgeuse is actually a sextuple star, but its companions are too small to be easily seen. It forms a point of the Winter Triangle .\nBellatrix (γ), \"warrior woman,\" is at Orion's left shoulder.\nAlnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka (ζ, ε and δ) make up the asterism known as Orion's Belt: three bright stars in a row; even from these alone one can recognize Orion.\nSaiph is at Orion's right knee.\nRigel (β), at the constellation's left knee, is a large white star, among the brightest of the sky. It has three companions, also difficult to see.\nThe major stars of Orion are all very similar in age and physical characteristics, suggesting that they may have a common origin. Betelgeuse is an exception to this, however.\nOrion is very useful in finding other stars. By extending the line of the Belt southwestward, Sirius (α Canis Majoris) can be found; northeastward, Aldebaran, α Tauri . A line eastward across the two shoulders indicates the direction of Procyon, α Canis Minoris. A line from Rigel through Betelgeuse points to Castor and Pollux, α and β Geminorum .\nNotable deep sky objects\nHanging from Orion's belt is his sword, consisting of the multiple stars θ1 and θ2 Orionis, called Trapezium and the nearby Orion Nebula (M42). This is a spectacular object that can clearly seen not to be a star with the naked eye; in binoculars, its swirling clouds of young stars, luminous gas, and dust can be seen.\nAnother famous nebula is IC 434, the Horsehead Nebula, near ζ Orionis. It contains a dark dust cloud whose shape gives the nebula its name.\nBesides these nebulae, surveying Orion with a small telescope will reveal a wealth of interesting deep-sky objects.\nHistory\nBeing such a brillant pattern of stars, Orion is recognized by many ancient civilizations, though with different images.\nThe ancient Sumerians saw this star pattern as a sheep. The name Betelgeuse literally means \"the armpit\"; in case of the Sumerians it meant \"the armpit of the sheep\".\nIn ancient China , Orion is one of the 28 zodiac Xiu (宿). Known as Shen (參), literally meaning \"three\", it is probably named because of the three stars on Orion's belt. See Chinese constellation .\nThe stars were considered to be a tribute to the god of light, Osiris by the ancient Egyptians .\nThe \"belt and sword\" of Orion are frequently referred to in ancient and modern literature, and even found recognition as the shoulder insignia of the 27th division of the United States Army during both World Wars, probably due to the fact that the division was commanded by General O'Ryan.\nMythology\nIt is not very surprising to see such a prominent constellation to have more than one version of story around it in Greek mythology . In one version, Orion claims himself to be the greatest hunter in the world. This is heard by Hera , the wife of Zeus , and she decided to send a scorpion. after Orion. Orion is stung to death by the scorpion. Zeus felt sorry for Orion and put him onto the sky. The scorpion is also taken up to the sky, becoming the constellation Scorpius . It is an interesting fact that when one of the two constellations rises from the horizon, the other would have already set. So the two rival can never see each other again.\nIt may be that the naming of the constellation precedes the mythology in this case. it has been suggested that Orion is named from the Akkadian Uru-anna, the light of heaven, the name then passing into Greek mythology.\nThe constellation is mentioned in Horace 's Odes, Homer 's Odyssey and Iliad , and Virgil 's Aeniad.\nThe constellation of Orion also appears in Milton 's Paradise Lost , and Tennyson 's Locksley Hall: \"Great Orion sloping slowly to the west\".",
                "Introduction to the Constellations.\nby Dave Snyder\nWritten: December, 2003\nThis page is for beginning amateur astronomers who are still learning how to    identify constellations.  It is designed for observers at about 40 degrees    north latitude (though it will work for latitudes somewhat north or south of    that).\nThere are four different charts, you should select a chart based on the time    of year, and whether you are observing before midnight (the evening) or after    midnight (the morning). It describes major “landmarks” in the night    sky and how to use those landmarks to find other constellations.\nIf you live in city or a suburban environment, you probably will encounter    light pollution.  Light pollution will prevent you from seeing all of the    stars shown in these charts; you can see the brighter stars, but you will not    see the fainter stars.  Your ability to see fainter stars will improve    if you can find a location away from bright lights and if you are patient: your    ability to see faint sees will improve if you allow your eyes to adjust to the    darkness for a half hour or more.\nYou may need to find a location away from obstructions like trees, buildings    and mountains.\nSpring Evenings & Winter Mornings\nThe stars of the Big Dipper are circumpolar from northern latitudes (this means    these stars are visible anytime it is dark) and can be used as a landmark.  The best time to use the Big Dipper as a landmark is Winter mornings and Spring    evenings.\nLook due north, the Big Dipper should be easy to see.  The Big Dipper      is part of the constellation Ursa Major.  Locate the stars Dubhe (marked      D on the chart), Merak (Me), Mizar (Mi), Alkaid (Al) and Muscida (Mu).  If you have reasonably good vision, you will see that Mizar is actually a double star.\nFollow Dubhe and Merak toward Polaris (marked P on the chart).  Nearby      you will see two stars (both marked G), they are called the Guardians.  Polaris and the Guardians are the brightest stars of Ursa Minor.  If      your skies are dark, you may be able to make out the other stars of Ursa Minor      (which form the so called Little Dipper).\nHalfway between Mizar and the Guardians, you may see a dim star called Thuban      (marked T).  Thuban is part of the constellation Draco; in dark skies      you can trace the path of Draco which winds between Ursa Major and Ursa Minor      until it ends at two stars (both marked Dr).\nFollow the arc formed by the stars Mizar (Mi) and Alkaid (Al) until you      find the bright star Arcturus (A).  Arcturus is the brightest star of      the constellation Boötes.\nIf you see a bright “star” along the green curve that is not shown on this chart, it could be a planet.  Planets are not shown on this chart.\nYou can continue the arc until you find another bright star Spica (labeled      S).  Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo (however Virgo      can be a little difficult to make out in light polluted skies).\nFollowing Dubhe and Merak away from Polaris, you can find another bright      star, Regulus (marked R on the chart).  Regulus is the brightest star      in the constellation Leo.  Leo is easy to recognize even in light polluted      skies.\nBetween Leo and Ursa Major is a dim constellation called Leo Minor.\nBetween Alkaid (Al) and Spica (S) is the star Cor Caroli (marked C on the      chart).  Cor Caroli is the brightest star in Canes Venatici, Canes Venatici      can be difficult to distinguish, there are only two bright stars in this constellation.\nBetween Virgo and Canes Venatici is the constellation Coma Berenices.  It is somewhat dim and may be hard to locate in light polluted skies.\nIn this diagram, Ursa Major is drawn suggesting Alkaid is the Bear’s nose.  However according to tradition Alkaid represents the tip of the Bear’s tail.  The lines were drawn this way to make the shape easier to find and remember.\nTwo dim constellations are not shown on this chart: Sextans (in the bottom right corner) and Camelopardalis (in the top right corner).\nSummer Evenings & Spring Mornings\nThe Summer Triangle is visible in the Northern Hemisphere during Summer evenings    and Spring mornings.  At these times the Summer Triangle can be used as    a landmark; follow these directions.\nFind the Summer Triangle in the sky - there should be three bright stars overhead or high in the sky (note there are other “triangles” in the sky, if the following instructions don’t work, then you may have located the wrong group of three stars).\nThe stars in the summer triangle are called Deneb (marked D on the chart) Altair (marked A on the chart) and Vega (marked V on the chart).\nLook closely near Deneb for the stars that make up Cygnus.  (Cygnus is      also known as the Swan).\nLook near Vega for the stars that make up Lyra (also known as the Harp).\nLook near Altair for the stars that make up Aquila (also known as the Eagle), Delphinus (also known as the Dolphin) and Sagitta (also known as the Arrow).  Delphinus and Sagitta will be difficult to see if your skies are not dark (if so binoculars will help - Delphinus is a very attractive constellation in binoculars).\nFrom Lyra, locate a group of four stars that comprise the “head” of Hercules.  If your skies are dark and clear you may see the globular      cluster M13 (marked GC on the chart).\nUsing Hercules and Altair as a guide, locate the star Rasalhague (marked R on the chart).  Rasalhague is part of the constellation Ophiuchus (the Snake Holder).  Ophiuchus is near the constellation Serpens, Serpens has two parts: one part, Serpens Cauda (the Tail of the Snake) is shown on this chart.\nUsing Hercules as a guide, locate the star Gemma (marked G on the chart).  Gemma is the brightest star in the constellation Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown).  While Gemma is reasonably bright, the remaining stars of Corona Borealis are not and will be difficult to see in light polluted skies.\nNow, if you look due south, you can see the constellations of Scorpius and Sagittarius (both are bright and easy to recognize, but not shown on this chart).  In dark skies you can see the Milky way starting at Sagittarius going across the sky through the Summer Triangle.\nNot shown on this chart is Vulpecula (a very dim constellation near Sagitta).\nAutumn Evenings and Summer Mornings\nThe Great Square is a group of four stars and is a good landmark to use in    Autumn evenings and Summer mornings.\nStart by looking for the four bright stars that make up the Great Square.  They are marked S1, S2, S3 and A1.  S1, S2 and S3 are part of the constellation      of Pegasus, and A1 (it has the name Alpheratz) is a star in the constellation      Andromeda.\nIf you follow along the backbone of Andromeda, you will locate stars marked      A2 and A3 - note the gap between A1 and A2 is rather wide and there is moderately      bright star in the middle.  Somewhat above the backbone is a fuzzy spot      that will be visible in relatively dark skies, it is marked G on the chart      and is the Andromeda Galaxy.\nContinuing along the backbone, you will reach P2 (called Algol).  P2      along with P1 (Algenib or Mirfak) make up the constellation of Perseus.\nNearby look for a group of five stars in a “W” shape.  This is the      constellation of Cassiopeia.\nIn dark skies, you may notice the Milky Way passing through Cassiopeia.\nNext to Cassiopeia, look for the constellation of Cepheus.\nIf you follow S1 and S3, they point to D (Denebe) which is part of the constellation      of Cygnus.\nBetween Cepheus and Pegasus is Lacerta (the Lizard).  It is a dim constellation      which may be difficult to see.\nNear Andromeda is the constellation of Aries.  Aries has two relatively      bright stars and several dimmer stars. The brightest of these stars, Hamal (Alpha Arietis), is marked H on the chart.\nBetween Andromeda and Aries is the constellation of Triangulum.  Triangulum consists of three stars, two of which are brighter than the third. \nIf you see a bright “star” along the green curve, it could be a planet.  Planets are not shown on this chart.\nPisces is a dim constellation that is difficult to make out.\nWinter Evenings & Autumn Mornings\nOrion is a bright, easy to recognize constellation visible in Autumn mornings and Winter evenings.  Use Orion as a landmark as follows:\nThe star pattern of Orion is distinctive and made of bright stars.  You should note three stars in particular: Betelgeuse (B), Bellatrix (Be)      and Rigel (R).  Halfway between the shoulder of Orion (Betelgeuse and      Bellatrix) and his feet (Rigel) are the three belt stars.  You will note a set of      stars that form a sword hanging from the belt; the middle star is not a star      at all - it is the Orion Nebula (marked N on the chart), you may notice that      appears blurry (look at it through binoculars).\nOrion is the part of the so called Winter Hexagon - to make out the hexagon      start at Rigel and work clockwise.  You will find five other bright stars:      Sirius (S), Procyon (P), Pollux (Po), Capella (C) and Aldebaran (A).\nNote, you may see bright “stars” along the green curved line, they may be      planets.  Planets are not marked on this diagram.\nSirius is part of Canis Major; try to make out the rest of Canis Major (dark      skies are needed to see all of the stars).\nProcyon is part of Canis Minor.  There are only two bright stars in      Canis Minor, Procyon and Gomeisa (G).\nPollux is part of Gemini.  The outline of Gemini is relatively easy      to recognize once you find Pollux (however some of the stars will not be visible      in light polluted skies).\nCapella is part of the constellation Auriga.\nAldebaran is the brightest star in Taurus.  Nearby you should see a      compact group of six or more stars.  This is the Pleiades (marked Pl      on the chart).\nNext to Auriga and Taurus, is Perseus.  You should find Algol (marked      Al on the chart), then try to make out the rest of the constellation.  Algol is a variable star; if you carefully observe it over the course of few      days, you might notice a change in brightness.\nBelow Orion, you will be able to see the four brightest stars of Lepus (at      least in dark skies), the rest of the constellation is harder to locate.\nThe following dim constellations are not marked on this chart:  Monoceros (between Orion and Canis Minor), Eridanus (to the right of Orion), Aries (near Perseus) and Lynx (near Gemini).\nReferences\nFor a list of the reference materials used to produce this guide, see the University Lowbrow Astronomer’s Book List.\nLinks",
                "Gemini? Here's your constellation | Constellations | EarthSky\nMythology and lore of the heavenly Twins.\nHere’s one way to see the constellation Gemini.  The two bright stars Castor and Pollux each mark a starry eye of a Twin.  If you have binoculars and a dark sky, be sure to check out Gemini’s beautiful star cluster, Messier 35, or M35, in western Gemini near the Taurus border.   See it, at the foot of Castor?\nThe fuzzy cluster at the lower right of this photo is M35 in Gemini.  Image via Wikimedia Commons\nWhen and how can I see the constellation Gemini in the night sky? You have lots of months during the year to observe Gemini, which is one of the brighter constellations of the Zodiac. The constellation Gemini lights up the early evening sky from January until May, though it’ll set in the west two hours earlier with each passing month. As seen from mid-northern latitudes, for example, Gemini stands upright over the western horizon around 5 a.m. local time in early February, 3 a.m. in early March, 1 a.m. (2 a.m. daylight saving time) in early April and 11 p.m. (midnight daylight saving time) in early May.\nJanuary and February present a grand time for observing the constellation Gemini because it is well up in the east at nightfall and stays out for most of the night. Gemini climbs highest in the sky around 10 p.m. local time in early February and 9 p.m. in late February.  That’s local time, the time on your clock, no matter where you live around the globe.\nGemini stays in view in the evening sky on through to May. By late May and June, Gemini is found low in the west-northwest corner of the sky at nightfall, and Gemini’s two brightest stars – Castor and Pollux – fade into the sunset by around the June 21 summer solstice.\nGemini is best identified by its two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux .  These two are noticeable for being bright and close together on the sky’s dome.  Like brothers!\nPollux is the brighter of two Twin stars\nBy the way, Gemini and nighttime’s brightest star, Sirius, reach the crest of their travels for the night at roughly the same time. At middle latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, we see Gemini’s brightest stars, Castor and Pollux nearly overhead while Sirius sparkles quite low in our southern sky. South of the equator, it’s the opposite: Sirius shines way up high while Gemini sits low in the northern sky.\nThe sun annually passes in front of the constellation Gemini the Twins from about June 21 until July 20. To remember these dates, keep in mind that the sun enters Gemini just after the June solstice and stays within Gemini for the following month. Gemini can’t be seen in late spring and early summer in the Northern Hemisphere – or late autumn and early winter in the Southern Hemisphere – because this is when the Heavenly Twins are lost in the glare of the sun.\nDrawn an imaginary line from Rigel through Betelgeuse to star-hop to Castor and Pollux\nFind Gemini from the constellation Orion. If you pick out any noticeable sky pattern in the February night sky, that pattern has a good chance of being the constellation Orion the Hunter.  On these February evenings, from the Northern Hemisphere, Orion is high in the south.\nOrion noticeable for its Belt stars, a short, straight row of three medium-bright stars.  Look below Orion’s Belt for the very bright star Rigel.  See it?  Now look above Orion’s Belt for the star Betelgeuse.  See that?  You can draw an imaginary line from Rigel through Betelgeuse to locate Castor and Pollux.  Remember, you’ll be looking for two bright stars that are noticeably close together.\nDraw an imaginary line diagonally through the Big Dipper bowl to locate Castor and Pollux\nUse the Big Dipper to find Gemini. This asterism – not a true constellation, but just a very clear dipper-shaped pattern of stars – is always located generally northward on the sky’s dome.  Draw an imaginary line diagonally through the bowl of the Big Dipper, from the star Megrez through the star Merak. You are going in the direction opposite of the Big Dipper handle.  This line will point to Castor and Pollux.\nBig and Little Dippers: Noticeable in the northern sky\nUse the moon to find Gemini. As the moon swings full circle through the constellations of the Zodiac, it passes through Gemini for a few days each month. Look on the sky chart above to see the ecliptic as a dotted red line crossing Gemini. The ecliptic marks the sun’s path on which the sun goes eastward (from right to left) in between the two bright Gemini stars, Castor and Pollux, and the brilliant star Procyon of Canis Minor the Lesser Dog. Whereas the sun passes eastward through Gemini for about one month a year, the moon goes eastward through Gemini for a few days each month.\nBecause the moon stays within plus or minus 5o (10 moon diameters) of the ecliptic – the sun’s path through the stars – the moon travels to the south of Castor and Pollux, and to the north of Procyon as it promenades across Gemini. In cycles of 18.6 years, the moon reaches its farthest point north of the ecliptic in Taurus and just misses occulting – covering over – the star Pollux. In ancient times, when Pollux was a little closer to the ecliptic, the moon used to occult – cover over – this star in centuries B.C.\nImage credit: Wikipedia\nMyth of the heavenly Twins. The scroll of the lore-laden heavens represents the meeting place of mortality and immortality, of where ancestry and posterity live together. Certainly, the Greek myth of Castor and Pollux explores the inherit duality of life – of mortality and immortality forever intertwined and perpetually in conflict.\nCastor and Pollux were the sons of the god Zeus and their mortal mother Leda. The offspring were a mix of the base and divine, with Castor being the mortal brother and Pollux immortal.  The two brothers well portray the dilemma of the human condition, the story repeating itself over the generations. Castor and Pollux were joyfully united in spirit yet sorrowfully divided by circumstance.\nWhen Castor was slain in battle, Pollux was inconsolable in grief, begging Zeus to relieve him of the bonds of immortality. Pollux chose death, so that he could join his brother Castor in the great beyond. To this day, Pollux and Castor stand reunited in the heavens, a tribute to the redemptive power of brotherly love.\nBottom line:  Want to find the constellation Gemini in the night sky.  Winter and spring provide a good time to look.  This constellation is noticeable for two bright stars that are close together on the sky’s dome.  In the mythology of the night sky, these two stars represent twin brothers."

                "James Naismith (November 6, 1861 – November 28, 1939) was a Canadian physical educator, physician, chaplain, sports coach and innovator. He invented the sport of basketball in 1891. He wrote the original basketball rulebook and founded the University of Kansas basketball program. Naismith lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, as well as the birth of the National Invitation Tournament (1938) and the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship (1939). \n\nBorn in Canada to Scottish immigrants, Naismith studied physical education at McGill University in Montreal before moving to the United States, where he developed basketball in late 1891 while teaching at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts.  After receiving his  MD in Denver in 1898, Naismith moved to the University of Kansas, later becoming the Kansas Jayhawks' athletic director. \n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\nNaismith was born in 1861 \nin Almonte (now part of Mississippi Mills), Ontario, Canada to parents who had immigrated from Scotland.\n He never had a middle name and never signed his name with the \"A\" initial. The \"A\" was added by someone in the administration at the University of Kansas. In 1982 Dr. Naismith's only living child stated that his father never had the middle initial \"A\". The Basketball Hall of Fame also clarifies this as do other members of his family and personal friends of his.\nNoted historian [http://curtisjphillips.tripod.com/index.html Curtis J. Phillips] has done extensive research on the subject.\n\nStruggling in school but gifted in farm labor, Naismith spent his days outside playing catch, hide-and-seek, or duck on a rock, a medieval game in which a person guards a large drake stone from opposing players, who try to knock it down by throwing smaller stones at it. To play duck on a rock most effectively, Naismith soon found that a soft lobbing shot was far more effective than a straight hard throw, a thought that later proved essential for the invention of basketball.\n Orphaned early in his life, Naismith lived with his aunt and uncle for many years and attended grade school at Bennies Corners near Almonte. Then he enrolled in Almonte High School, in Almonte, Ontario, from which he graduated in 1883.\n\nIn the same year, Naismith entered McGill University in Montreal. Although described as a slight figure, standing 5 foot 10 ½ and listed at 168 pounds,\n he was a talented and versatile athlete, representing McGill in Canadian football, lacrosse, rugby, soccer and gymnastics. He played center on the football team, and made himself some padding to protect his ears. It was for personal use, not team use.  He won multiple Wicksteed medals for outstanding gymnastics performances.\n Naismith earned a BA in Physical Education (1888) and a Diploma at the Presbyterian College in Montreal (1890). From 1891 on, Naismith taught physical education and became the first McGill director of athletics, but then left Montreal to become a physical education teacher at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. \n\nSpringfield College: Invention of \"Basket Ball\"\n\nAt Springfield YMCA, Naismith struggled with a rowdy class that was confined to indoor games throughout the harsh New England winter and thus was perpetually short-tempered. Under orders from Dr. Luther Gulick, head of Springfield YMCA Physical Education, Naismith was given 14 days to create an indoor game that would provide an \"athletic distraction\": Gulick demanded that it would not take up much room, could help its track athletes to keep in shape and explicitly emphasized to \"make it fair for all players and not too rough.\"\n\nIn his attempt to think up a new game, Naismith was guided by three main thoughts. Firstly, he analyzed the most popular games of those times (rugby, lacrosse, soccer, football, hockey, and baseball); Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball and concluded that the big soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball, dribbling or hitting it, so he decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable, namely placing it high above the player's heads. To score goals, he forced the players to throw a soft lobbing shot that had proven effective in his old favorite game duck on a rock. Naismith christened this new game \"Basket Ball\" and put his thoughts together in 13 basic rules.\n\nThe first game of \"Basket Ball\" was played in December 1891. In a handwritten report, Naismith described the circumstances of the inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: \"When Mr. Stubbins brot  up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them on the inside of the railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class... The class did not show much enthusiasm but followed my lead... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men & tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon.\" In contrast to modern basketball, the original rules did not include what is known today as the dribble. Since the ball could only be moved up the court via a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also following each \"goal\" a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are obsolete in the rules of modern basketball.\n\nIn a radio interview in January 1939, Naismith gave more details of the first game and the initial rules that were used:\n“I showed them two peach baskets I’d nailed up at each end of the gym, and I told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team’s peach basket.  I blew a whistle, and the first game of basketball began.  …  The boys began tackling, kicking and punching in the clinches.  They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor.  [The injury toll: several black eyes, one separated shoulder and one player knocked unconscious.] “It certainly was murder.”  [Naismith changed some of the rules as part of his quest to develop a clean sport.]  The most important one was that there should be no running with the ball.  That stopped tackling and slugging. We tried out the game with those [new] rules (fouls) , and we didn’t have one casualty.” \n\nBy 1892, basketball had grown so popular on campus that Dennis Horkenbach (editor-in-chief of The Triangle, the Springfield college newspaper) featured it in an article called \"A New Game\", and there were calls to call this new game \"Naismith Ball\", but Naismith refused. By 1893, basketball was introduced internationally by the YMCA movement. From Springfield, Naismith went to Denver where he acquired a medical degree and in 1898 he joined the University of Kansas faculty at Lawrence, Kansas after coaching at Baker University.\n\nThe family of Lambert G. Will has claimed that Dr. Naismith borrowed components for the game of basketball from Will to dispute Naismith's sole creation of the game, citing alleged photos and letters.\n\nUniversity of Kansas\n\nThe University of Kansas men's basketball program officially began in 1898, following Naismith's arrival, just six years after Naismith drafted the sport's first official rules. Naismith was not initially hired to coach basketball, but rather as a chapel director and physical education instructor. In these early days, the majority of the basketball games were played against nearby YMCA teams, with YMCAs across the nation having played an integral part in the birth of basketball. Other common opponents were Haskell Indian Nations University and William Jewell College. Under Naismith, the team played only one current Big 12 school: Kansas State (once). Naismith was, ironically, the only coach in the program's history to have a losing record (55–60). However, Naismith coached Forrest \"Phog\" Allen, his eventual successor at Kansas, who went on to join his mentor in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.  When Allen became a coach himself and told him that he was going to coach basketball at Baker University in 1904, Naismith discouraged him: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\" Instead, Allen embarked on a coaching career that would lead him to be known as \"the Father of Basketball Coaching.\" During his time at Kansas, Allen coached Dean Smith (1952 National Championship team) and Adolph Rupp (1922 Helms Foundation National Championship team). Allen, Smith and Rupp have joined Naismith as members of the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nBy the turn of the century, there were enough college teams in the East of the U.S. that the first intercollegiate competitions could be played out. Although his sport continuously grew, Naismith long regarded his game as a curiosity and preferred gymnastics and wrestling as better forms of physical education. However, basketball became a demonstration sport at the 1904 Games in St. Louis. As the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame reports, Naismith was also neither interested in self-promotion nor in the glory of competitive sports. Instead, he was more interested in his physical education career, receiving an honorary PE Masters degree in 1910, patrolled the Mexican border for four months in 1916, traveled to France, published two books (A Modern College in 1911 and Essence of a Healthy Life in 1918). He took American citizenship in 1925.\n\nIn 1935, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (created by Naismith's pupil Phog Allen) collected money so that the 74-year-old Naismith could witness the introduction of basketball into the official Olympic sports program of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games. There, Naismith handed out the medals to three North American teams: United States, for the gold medal, Canada, for the silver medal, and Mexico, for their bronze medal win.  During the Olympics, he was named the honorary president of the International Basketball Federation. When Naismith returned he commented that seeing the game played by many nations was the greatest compensation he could have received for his invention. In 1937, Naismith played a role in the formation of the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball, which later became the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). \n\nNaismith became Professor Emeritus in Kansas when he retired in 1937 at the age of 76. Including his years as coach, Naismith served as athletic director and faculty at the school for a total of almost 40 years. Naismith died in 1939 after he suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage. He was buried in Lawrence, Kansas. His masterwork \"Basketball — its Origins and Development\" was published posthumously in 1941. In Lawrence, Kansas, James Naismith has a road named in his honor, Naismith Drive, which runs in front of Allen Fieldhouse (the official address of Allen Fieldhouse is 1651 Naismith Drive), the university's basketball facility.  The university also named the court in Allen Fieldhouse James Naismith Court in his honor, despite Naismith having the worst record in school history. Naismith Hall, a college residential dormitory, is located on the northeastern edge of 19th Street and Naismith Drive.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nIn 1898, Naismith became the first college basketball coach of the University of Kansas basketball team. He compiled a record of 55–60, and is, ironically, the only losing coach in Kansas history. Naismith is at the top of massive and prestigious coaching tree, as he coached Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach Phog Allen, who himself coached Hall of Fame coaches Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, and Ralph Miller who all coached future coaches as well.\n\nLegacy\n\nNaismith was the inventor of basketball and wrote the original 13 rules of this sport. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, is named in his honor, and he was an inaugural inductee in 1959. The National Collegiate Athletic Association rewards its best players and coaches annually with the Naismith Awards, among them the Naismith College Player of the Year, the Naismith College Coach of the Year and the Naismith Prep Player of the Year. After the Olympic introduction to male athletes in 1936, women's basketball became an Olympic event in Montreal during the 1976 Summer Olympics. Naismith was also inducted into the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame, the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame, the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame, the Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame, FIBA Hall of Fame, and The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which was named in his honor.  The FIBA Basketball World Cup trophy is named the \"James Naismith Trophy\" in his honour. On June 21, 2013, Dr. Naismith was inducted into the Kansas Hall of Fame during ceremonies in Topeka.\n\nNaismith's home town of Almonte, Ontario, hosts an annual 3-on-3 tournament for all ages and skill levels in his honor. Every year this event attracts hundreds of participants and involves over 20 half court games along the main street of the town. All proceeds of the event go to youth basketball programs in the area.\n\nBasketball is today played by more than 300 million people worldwide, making it one of the most popular team sports. In North America, basketball has produced some of the most-admired athletes of the 20th century. Polls conducted by ESPN and the Associated Press named basketball player Michael Jordan respectively first and second greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, and both polls featured fellow basketball players Wilt Chamberlain (of KU, like Naismith) and Bill Russell in the Top 20. \n\nIn December, 2010, the original rules of basketball written by James Naismith in 1891, considered to be basketball's founding document, was auctioned at Sotheby's in New York. Josh Swade, a University of Kansas alumnus and basketball enthusiast, went on a crusade in 2010 to persuade moneyed alumni to considering bidding on and hopefully winning the document at auction to gift it to the University of Kansas. Swade eventually persuaded David G. Booth, a billionaire investment banker and KU alumnus, and his wife Suzanne Booth to commit to bidding at the auction. The Booths won the bidding and purchased the document for a record $4,338,500 USD, the most ever paid for a sports memorabilia item, and gifted the document to the University of Kansas.  Swade's project and eventual success are chronicled in a 2012 ESPN 30 for 30 documentary \"There's No Place Like Home\" and in a corresponding book, \"The Holy Grail of Hoops: One Fan's Quest to Buy the Original Rules of Basketball\".  The University of Kansas constructed an $18 million building named the Debruce Center, which houses the rules and opened in March 2016. \n\nPersonal life\n\nNaismith was the eldest child of Margaret and John Naismith, two Scottish immigrants. His mother, Margaret Young, was born in 1833 and immigrated as the fourth of 11 children to Lanark County, Canada in 1852. His father, John Naismith, was born in 1833,  left Europe when he was 18, and also settled down in Lanark County. On June 20, 1894, Naismith married Maude Evelyn Sherman (September 6, 1870 – March 4, 1937) in Springfield, MA, USA. The couple had five children: Margaret Mason (Stanley) (July 2, 1895 – October 1976), Helen Carolyn (Dodd) (December 21, 1897 – August 21, 1980), John Edwin (November 3, 1900 – December 18, 1986), Maude Ann (Dawe) (October 22, 1904 – April 1972) and James Sherman (May 7, 1913 – May 6, 1980). He was a member of the Pi Gamma Mu and Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternities. Naismith was a Presbyterian minister, and was also remembered as a Freemason.  Maude Naismith died in 1937, and on June 11, 1939, he married his second wife Florence B. Kincaid. Naismith suffered a major brain hemorrhage on November 19 the same year and died nine days later in his home located in Lawrence, Kansas. Naismith was 78 years old. Naismith is buried with his first wife in Memorial Park Cemetery in Lawrence, KS.  Florence Kincaid died in 1977 at the age of 98 and is buried with her first husband Dr. Frank B. Kincaid in Elmwood Cemetery in Beloit, KS.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Naismith's education and academic positions held were as follows:"

It is currently the largest stadium in the world, with a capacity of 150,000, and occupying over 207,000 m².\nOverview:\nIt is currently used for football matches, a few athletics events, but most often for Arirang performances (also known as the Mass Games). The stadium can seat 150,000, which is the largest stadium by capacity in the world and the world's 12th largest sporting venue.\nIts name comes from Rungrado Islet in the Taedong River, upon which it is situated, and May Day, the international labour day. Its scalloped roof features 16 arches arranged in a ring, and it is said to resemble a magnolia blossom. It is not to be confused with the nearby 50,000 capacity Kim Il-sung Stadium.\nIt hosts events on a main pitch sprawling across over 22,500 m² (242,200 ft²). Its total floor space is over 207,000 m² (2.2 million ft²) across eight stories, and the lobes of its roof peak at more than 60 m (197 ft) from the ground.\nWhile the stadium is used for sporting events, it is most famous as the site of massive performances and shows celebrating Kim Il-sung and the North Korean nation. In June–July 2002 it was the site of the colossal and meticulously choreographed \"Arirang\" gymnastic and artistic performance (often referred to elsewhere as \"mass games\"). The extravaganza involved for the first time some 100,000+ participants—double the number of spectators—and was open to foreigners. These performances are now an annual feature in Pyongyang, usually in August and September. The Guinness Book of Records has recognized these events as the largest in the world.\nIn the late 1990s, a number of North Korean army generals implicated in an assassination attempt on Kim Jong-Il were executed via burning in the stadium.\nIt was also the venue in which Kim Jong-Il in 2000 entertained Madeleine Albright, the U.S. Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton. Collision in Korea was the largest professional wrestling pay-per-view event ever that was jointly produced by World Championship Wrestling and New Japan Pro Wrestling. It took place over a period of two days on April 28 and 29, 1995 at the stadium and had a record attendance of 150,000 and 190,000. It did not air in North America until August 4, 1995.\nJOIN VSP GROUP PARTNER PROGRAM: https://youpartnerwsp.com/ru/join?89424\nCategory",
                "Rungrado 1st of May: The largest stadium in the world\nRungrado 1st of May: The largest stadium in the world\nOctober 28th, 2014\nviktor\nOfficially, the largest stadium in the world is Rungrado 1st of May. This giant structure has a 150 thousand people capacity and it hosts some of the most spectacular events in the world. The drawback is that most of the world wouldn’t be able too see them. Why? Because it is set in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea.\nWe’ll try to restraint ourselves from political comments, after all Artcocktail is all about cocktails, I mean art. The fact of the matter is that since its opening in 1989, the stadium has been famous not so much for the football matches and sport competitions, as much as the mass games, in which usually more than 30 thousand people take part. Voluntarily or not (we don’t know), the participants form the biggest art festivities in the world, synchronously waving colored cards, so that they  can depict enormous images.\nThese pictures are usually scenes from the Korean war or part of the North Korean history, primarily tied with its totalitarian leaders (Kim Jong II, Kim II Sung, etc.). Inside the stadium, which is with the shape of blossoming magnolia, the seats are always full during the Arirang Festival. Also known as the Mass Games, they take place from August or to September. The elaborate choreography is performed by school students, who practice for months beforehand.\nForeign tourists are also allowed to watch the spectacle, but the prices for them are very high – between 100 and 300 Euros. Nevertheless, it would certainly be something that can be seen only once in a lifetime.\nPhoto courtesy of Jason Lee/Reuters",
                "Biggest Stadiums in The World By Capacity - WorldAtlas.com\nWorld Facts\nBiggest Stadiums in The World By Capacity\nRungrado 1st of May Stadium is the largest sports stadium in the world followed by 8 college football stadiums and Melbourne Cricket Ground rounds of the top 10\nRungrado 1st of May Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in North Korea that was completed on May 1, 1989.\nStadiums are not only architectural marvels but massive theaters of entertainment, celebration and passion. Among the largest fifty stadiums in the world, approximately half are found in the United States, a quarter in Europe and the rest are scattered in South America, Asia and a few in Africa. Noticeably, the largest stadiums in the world host American college football teams.\nGigantic stadiums are known to host rugby, cricket and even martial arts festivals find their way into the list of the world’s largest stadiums. North Korea’s Rungrado 1st of May Stadium which is the world’s largest stadium with a capacity of 150,000 people hosts football games besides a festival called Arirang (gymnastic and artistic games). Australia’s Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) which hosts 100, 024 people and is primarily a cricket ground comes in at number 10 among the world’s largest. Twickenham Stadium (82, 000) in the UK mostly hosts rugby games and it comes in at position 31.\nMajority of the world’s largest stadiums are found in the US. Eight out of the top ten largest stadiums in the world are in the US where they play host to American football and baseball teams. Some of them are Michigan Stadium (107, 601 people) in position two behind Rungrado, while Beaver Stadium (107, 572), Ohio Stadium (104, 944) and Kyle Field (102, 512) complete the top five. In total, 22 stadiums among the top fifty are all in the US where they host American football and baseball games. The two sports demand larger playing area thereby providing for the construction of larger spectator areas on the fringes of the pitch. The two games are wildly popular in the US and hence the big stadiums to accommodate the thousands of fans who turn up at almost every game.\nStadiums in the US and Europe are also increasing their capacities. For instance, Tiger Stadium expanded from a 92,400 to 100,000 capacity while Texas’s Kyle stadium will accommodate 27,000 more people from the current 82,000 stadium after its expansion. Wembley Stadium which comes in at number 19 among the world’s largest, was expanded from a 40,000 to a 90,000 capacity stadium in 2003 while Russia's Luzhiniki Stadium was expanded some years ago to the current capacity of 78,000.\nAlthough soccer is the world’s most popular sport, it loses out in terms of its stadiums’ capacities. Only three stadiums are primarily known for soccer- Camp Nou (99, 786), Estadio Azteca (95, 500), Soccer City (94, 713) appear in among the top 15 of the world’s largest. In total only 15 stadiums know to host soccer around the world make it to the top fifty.\nAfrica and Asia contribute approximately 10 stadiums among the top fifty largest in the world. Several stadiums such as Indonesia's Gelora Bung Karno Stadium (88,306) and Congo’s Stade des Martyrs (80, 000) are an indication that the sports has gained root in the two regions and more big stadiums are to be built.\nThe United States dominates when it comes to having the largest stadiums in the world. The country's massive popularity of American football and baseball backed by the lucrativeness of the sports has seen many teams construct colossal stadiums for their home teams. Europe, which is the home of soccer has a significant number of large stadiums that play host to soccer matches. However, and in a unique twist, North Korea plays host to the world's largest stadium which can host up to 150,000 people.\nBiggest Stadiums in The World By Capacity\nView information as a:",

                "Rungrado May Day Stadium – StadiumDB.com\nAdvertisement\nDescription: Rungrado May Day Stadium\nThe national stadium of North Korea was built as a response to Seoul’s Olympic Stadium as part of rivalry between the two countries. Construction took 2.5 years, not long for the building’s immense scale. Upon opening its capacity was set at 150,000, the largest in the world. Inauguration took place on May Day preceding the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students.\nMost spectacular element of the stadium is its roof. Should official data be correct, it covers 94,000sqm, which is double the figure of previous record-holder King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh. 11,000 of steel supports the outer sheets, forming 16 petal-shaped segments. They span 60 meters inside the stadium and 40 meters out. The entire structure is 60m high.\nBy shape it resembles a parachute and – in a different symbolic connotation – a magnolia flower. The unique roof was noticed and awarded first prize during the 1988 International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva.\nIts stands are far more conventional, forming two large rings. Part of the lower one is based on landfill, while the remainder supports what may be one of the largest training complexes ever built. With total floor space of over 200,000sqm the stadium provides numerous facilities, including running tracks, swimming pools and indoor halls, where sportsmen prepare during the year.\nBecause of its scale, the stadium the stadium saw many great events, setting the world attendance record for wrestling at 190,000 spectators in 1995. Though, ironically, not used for large football and athletic events as much as it should, it also houses the annual Arirang festival. It also saw the public execution of generals plotting against dictator Kim Jong Il in 1992.   \nAdvertisement",

                "The Gardiner Dam on the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatchewan is the third largest embankment dam in Canada and one of the largest embankment dams in the world. Construction on Gardiner Dam and the smaller Qu'Appelle River Dam was started in 1959 and completed in 1967, creating Lake Diefenbaker upstream and diverting a considerable portion of the South Saskatchewan's flow into the Qu'Appelle River.  The dam rises 64 metres (209 feet) in height, is almost 5 km long and has a width of  at its base with a volume of 65,000,000 cubic meters.  The dam is owned and operated by the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority. \n\nDanielson Provincial Park has property on both sides of the dam. On the northeast end is the RV park and on the southwest end is a beach, restaurant and guided tours of the Coteau Creek Hydroelectric Station. The park was named after Gustaf Herman Danielson (former Saskatchewan Liberal Party MLA).\n\nAn integrated power generating plant, SaskPower's Coteau Creek Hydroelectric Station, produces a net 186 MW of electricity from three 62 MW generators.  Highway 44 crosses the river atop the dam.\n\nThe dam is named for a former Premier of Saskatchewan and longtime federal cabinet minister, James G. Gardiner."

                "The Monarchy in Canada » J.J.'s Complete Guide to Canada\nSearch\nThe Monarchy in Canada\nPortraits of the Queen remain a common sight in most Canadian government buildings, including libraries, schools, city halls and community centres. But few are as big as this one, seen in the lobby of the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nMany foreigners, and even some Canadians, are surprised to learn that Canada is a monarchy, but it’s true. The only one in North America, in fact!\nAs we learned in the history chapter , Canada was once a colony of Britain, but unlike many of England’s other former colonies around the world, Canada never experienced a sharp break with the motherland. Canadian independence evolved slowly under British colonial supervision, as opposed to rising in opposition to British rule, as was the case in America and Kenya and elsewhere. This is the main reason why the Canadian system of government still has such a distinctly British feel; the system was largely British-made.\nThe most prominent lingering legacy of Canada’s British connection is the Queen. Though Canada now has full political independence from the U.K., the nation never cut its ties to the British royal family, resulting in an unusual state of affairs that is sometimes referred to as the “shared monarchy.”\nThe Queen of Canada\nThe Queen's periodic visits to Canada tend to be huge media spectacles, with many high-profile photo ops across the country. Her exact tour routes are meticulously planned by the government.\nUnder the terms of the Canadian Constitution , the king or queen of the United Kingdom will always be recognized as the king or queen “of Canada,” as well. So the current Queen of Canada is Elizabeth II (b. 1926), and the future King of Canada will either be her son, Prince Charles (b. 1948), or, depending on how things go, her more popular and handsome grandson, Prince William (b. 1982).\nThis arrangement allows Canada to still be “under” the British royals, while simultaneously allowing Canada to make the argument that it actually has its “own” independent monarchy. In other words, Elizabeth is supposed to consider her role as Canada’s queen distinct from her role as Britain’s queen, and so are the rest of us. She’s like an actor playing two different roles.\nThis unusual “sharing” of the British monarchy is not exclusive to Canada, however. About a dozen or so countries have a similar arrangement worked out with Britain’s monarch, notably Australia, Jamaica and New Zealand, as well as a few smaller island nations in the Caribbean and Pacific. At one time this group of countries was known as the “ British Commonwealth ,” but in recent decades that group has expanded into a more generic “make the planet better” international organization, and now includes many countries that have no links to the British crown — or even Britain — at all. The more proper name for countries that share the crown is the “Commonwealth Realm,” and Her Majesty’s site has a  complete list  of those 15 nations that exist within it.\nThe Monarchy as a Political Symbol\nDoes the Queen have any power over Canada? It’s a common question, but the answer is a little complicated. On the one hand, the Queen doesn’t do much. She visits Canada only rarely — once every three or four years at best — and when she does, her primary purpose is simply to cut ribbons, shake hands and smile for photographers.\nCanadian immigrants are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Queen before they can become citizens. The same oath of loyalty must be taken by judges, politicians, soldiers and other high-ranking officials.\nOn the other hand, the Canadian Constitution grants sweeping political powers to the Queen, and declares that “ the executive government and authority of and over Canada ” is vested in her. Among other things, she is said to be the head of Canada’s parliament and the commander-in-chief of the Canadian armed forces .\nThese two seemingly contradictory situations work together because Canada is what they call a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch agrees to delegate her powers to the nation’s elected politicians, rather than use them herself. In Canadian law, the impressive powers of the monarch are thus formally held by Elizabeth II but lent to other people, mostly the  Prime Minister of Canada , who governs on the “Queen’s behalf” and passes laws in her name using her authority. Canadian laws are often full of reference to Her Majesty requesting this, or Her Majesty wanting that; it’s all a bit of ceremony and theatre relating to this idea of delegated royal power. In reality, the Queen doesn’t care one way or another, and is not personally involved in these decisions.\nFormally, Queen Elizabeth II is described as being Canada’s head of state — a symbolic figure of political authority — but the prime minister is called the head of government — the actual ruler of the country. The Crown is often used as a synonym for the entire Canadian government itself, especially in terms of property, such as Crown-owned land, or law, such as the Crown’s defence team.\nThe Republic vs. Monarchist Debate\nNot everyone in Canada loves the monarchy. In fact, according to many polls, the country may be split 50-50 or worse. There has been rising debate in recent decades as to whether or not retaining ties to the monarchy is actually useful to Canada, or whether it simply undermines Canada’s independence from Britain, and ties the country to an old-fashioned, out-of-date political system — even if only symbolically.\nEvery time a member of the royal family visits Canada, the media tends to run a lot of stories about the future of the monarchy, and whether it has enough public support to survive.\nThough no major political party in Canada is officially in favour of cutting the country’s royal ties, there are two high-profile lobby groups that often debate the issue in the media:  the Monarchist League of Canada  (pro) and  Citizens for a Canadian Republic (anti). It’s not easy to generalize what sorts of people support one side over the other. Support or opposition to the monarchy does not tend to be a neatly right- or left-wing issue, and on any given day you can find no shortage of journalists, politicians, or academics willing to argue passionately for either side.\nMonarchist Canadians argue that the monarchy is an important unifying symbol of Canada’s history and heritage, and the Queen and her family are uplifting, positive role models — especially in contrast to divisive and unpopular politicians. Though these points are obviously debatable, for now, the monarchists definitely have the upper hand. Getting rid of the monarchy in Canada would require a constitutional amendment, and lacking much political momentum for such a move, the goal still seems a long way off.\nPast Monarchs\nIt can be a subject of some debate regarding how many monarchs have historically ruled Canada. The government of Canada’s official list  jointly recognizes both French and British monarchs as being “sovereigns of Canada” from the mid-1400s until 1775, and then solely British monarchs from there on out. This means that the first English monarch of Canada was Henry VII (1457-1509, ruled 1485-1509) and the first French monarch was Francis I (1494-1547, ruled 1515-1547). Of course, to say “Canada” existed in the 15th century is obviously quite charitable; at best, these kings merely presided over a tiny smattering of colonial settlements occupying an extremely small fraction of the country’s modern-day borders. More reasonable lists will therefore only recognize the post-1867 monarchs of the United Kingdom as true sovereigns of Canada, since that was the year Canada’s modern-day Constitution , which enshrines the country’s current system of constitutional monarchy, was adopted.\nVictoria (served 1837-1901)\nBy the 19th century, Britain’s monarchs had already lost most of their political power, and Victoria’s (1819-1901) personal involvement with Canada came mostly in the form of naming cities and approving capitals. She remained highly venerated as a symbol of the Empire’s glory, however, and Canadians still celebrate her birthday as an official holiday .\nEdward VII (served 1901-1910)\nThe eldest son of Victoria, Edward (1841-1910) made headlines in 1860 when he became the first British prince to visit North America, touring both Canada and the United States. Due to the length of his mother’s rule, he ascended to the throne as a relatively old man, and his reign was brief and mostly uneventful.\nGeorge V (served 1910-1936)\nThe first monarch to be keenly aware of the power of the media, George V (1865-1936) helped popularize the modern idea of an image-conscious royal family. His reign also presided over an unprecedented transfer of sovereignty to self-governing colonies like Canada, meaning a number of key constitutional laws from the era were passed in his name.\nEdward VIII (served 1936)\nEdward (1894-1972) was a popular and charming prince, both in England and abroad, but he lacked a commitment to royal life. His desire to marry a twice-divorced American woman was considered scandalous in those more conservative times, and he was forced to resign less than a year after becoming king.\nGeorge VI (served 1936-1952)\nGeorge (1895-1952) unexpectedly assumed the throne following his brother’s abdication. In 1939, he became the first British king to visit Canada, touring the country from coast to coast amid great spectacle. A symbol of perseverance during World War II, though he died young, his memory survived for a long time under his widow Elizabeth (1900-2002), the so-called “Queen Mother.”\nElizabeth II (served 1952-present)\nFollowing her father’s death, Elizabeth (b. 1926) became the first British monarch to be specifically proclaimed “Queen of Canada.” Her reign saw the final dissolution of the British Empire into the Commonwealth, which she has worked hard to keep relevant. Fond of royal visits, she has toured Canada an impressive  22 times  and has participated in several historic Canadian ceremonies.\nHeirs to the Throne\nPrince Charles\nThe eldest son of Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles (b. 1948) is similar to Edward VII in that he has spent a very long time serving as heir to his long-reigning mother. Best known for his ill-fated marriage to the glamorous Princess Diana (1961-1997), Charles has often struggled to remain popular in the age of tabloids. He has visited Canada almost as often as his mother, usually in Elizabeth’s “off-years.”\nPrince William\nCharming Prince William (b. 1982), the eldest son of Prince Charles and his late first wife, remains the great hope for the future of the monarchy. Well-known for his quiet, unpretentious nature and beautiful young wife, Kate Middleon (b. 1982), William remains far more popular than his father — meaning there is heavy pressure to skip a generation and let him become king when his grandmother dies.\nPrince George\nLittle George, the first child of Prince William, was born in 2013 amid much hoopla. He is now third in line to the throne, after his father and grandfather, though he’ll probably be waiting a while.\nThe Queen’s Representative\nQueen Elizabeth ceremonially opened the Canadian Parliament in 1957 and 1977. It may say something about the growing controversy of the monarchy that she's never been asked to do it since.\nThe Queen is very rarely in Canada for obvious reasons, but there are still a lot of papers and things for her to sign, even if they are just formalities declaring “I agree with what the politicians say.” In acknowledgement that the real monarch can’t be counted on to perform these functions, the Canadian government has always employed an officer known as the Governor General of Canada who basically performs the duties of “acting monarch” in Canada. The governor general is authorized to ceremonially sign and approve things on behalf of the Queen, and in doing so ensures that the entire “monarchy system” continues to function properly, even in the absence of an actual monarch on Canadian soil.\nThe Governor General of Canada is often an interesting and dynamic political figure in his or her own right, so let’s turn the page and learn more about that job .\nLinks About The Monarchy:"

                "Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: ') is a constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland and the largest outside of Great Britain.  It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \"part\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms.    Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \"put forward views and proposals\" with \"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\". \n\nNorthern Ireland was created in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by an act of the British parliament. Unlike Southern Ireland, which would become the Irish Free State in 1922, the majority of Northern Ireland's population were unionists, who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom,  most of whom were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain; however, a significant minority, mostly Catholics, were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule.     Today, the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish, while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned. \n\nFor most of the 20th century, when it came into existence, Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble called a \"cold house\" for Catholics. In the late 1960s, conflict between state forces and chiefly Protestant unionists on the one hand, and chiefly Catholic nationalists on the other, erupted into three decades of violence known as the Troubles, which claimed over 3,500 lives and caused over 50,000 casualties.   The 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a major step in the peace process, including the decommissioning of weapons, although sectarianism and religious segregation still remain major social problems and sporadic violence has continued. \n\nNorthern Ireland has historically been the most industrialised region of Ireland. After declining as a result of the political and social turmoil of the Troubles,  its economy has grown significantly since the late 1990s. The initial growth came from the \"peace dividend\" and the links and increased trade with the Republic of Ireland, continuing with a significant increase in tourism, investment and business from around the world. Unemployment in Northern Ireland peaked at 17.2% in 1986, dropping to 6.1%  and down by 1.2 percentage points over the year,  similar to the UK figure of 6.2%.  58.2% of those unemployed had been unemployed for over a year.\n\nProminent artists and sports persons from Northern Ireland include Van Morrison, Rory McIlroy, Joey Dunlop, Wayne McCullough and George Best. Some people in Northern Ireland prefer to identify as Irish (e.g., poet Seamus Heaney and actor Liam Neeson) while others prefer to identify as British (e.g. actor Kenneth Branagh). Cultural links between Northern Ireland, the rest of Ireland, and the rest of the UK are complex, with Northern Ireland sharing both the culture of Ireland and the culture of the United Kingdom. In many sports, the island of Ireland fields a single team, a notable exception being association football. Northern Ireland competes separately at the Commonwealth Games, and people from Northern Ireland may compete for either Great Britain or Ireland at the Olympic Games.\n\nHistory\n\nThe region that is now Northern Ireland was the bedrock of the Irish war of resistance against English programmes of colonialism in the late 16th century. The English-controlled Kingdom of Ireland had been declared by the English king Henry VIII in 1542, but Irish resistance made English control fragmentary. Following Irish defeat at the Battle of Kinsale, though, the region's Gaelic, Roman Catholic aristocracy fled to continental Europe in 1607 and the region became subject to major programmes of colonialism by Protestant English (mainly Anglican) and Scottish (mainly Presbyterian) settlers. A rebellion in 1641 by Irish aristocrats against English rule resulted in a massacre of settlers in Ulster in the context of a war breaking out between England, Scotland and Ireland fuelled by religious intolerance in government. Victories by English forces in that war and further Protestant victories in the Williamite War in Ireland toward the close of the 17th century solidified Anglican rule in Ireland. In Northern Ireland, the victories of the Siege of Derry (1689) and the Battle of the Boyne (1690) in this latter war are still celebrated by some Protestants (both Anglican and Presbyterian).  \n\nFollowing the victory of 1691, and contrary to the terms of the Treaty of Limerick, after the Pope who had been allied to William of Orange recognised James II as continuing king of Great Britain and Ireland in place of William, a series of penal laws was passed  by the Anglican ruling class in Ireland. Their intention was to materially disadvantage the Catholic community and, to a lesser extent, the Presbyterian community. In the context of open institutional discrimination, the 18th century saw secret, militant societies develop in communities in the region and act on sectarian tensions in violent attacks. These events escalated at the end of the century following an event known as the Battle of the Diamond, which saw the supremacy of the Anglican and Presbyterian Peep o'Day Boys over the Catholic Defenders and leading to the formation of the Anglican Orange Order. A rebellion in 1798 led by the cross-community Belfast-based Society of the United Irishmen and inspired by the French Revolution sought to break the constitutional ties between Ireland and Britain and unite Irish people of all religions. Following this, in an attempt to quell sectarianism and force the removal of discriminatory laws (and to prevent the spread of French-style republicanism to Ireland), the government of the Kingdom of Great Britain pushed for the two kingdoms to be merged. The new state, formed in 1801, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, was governed from a single government and parliament based in London.\n\nBetween 1717 and 1775 some 250,000 people from Ulster emigrated to the British North American colonies.  It is estimated that there are more than 27 million Scotch-Irish Americans now living in the US. \n\nPartition of Ireland\n\nDuring the 19th century, legal reforms started in the late 18th century continued to remove statutory discrimination against Catholics, and progressive programmes enabled tenant farmers to buy land from landlords. By the close of the century, autonomy for Ireland within the United Kingdom, known as Home Rule, was regarded as highly likely. In 1912, after decades of obstruction from the House of Lords, Home Rule became a near-certainty. A clash between the House of Commons and House of Lords over a controversial budget produced the Parliament Act 1911, which enabled the veto of the Lords to be overturned. The House of Lords veto had been the unionists' main guarantee that Home Rule would not be enacted, because the majority of members of the House of Lords were unionists. In response, opponents to Home Rule, from Conservative and Unionist Party leaders such as Andrew Bonar Law and Dublin-based barrister Sir Edward Carson to militant working class unionists in Ireland, threatened the use of violence. In 1914, they smuggled thousands of rifles and rounds of ammunition from Imperial Germany for use by the Ulster Volunteers (UVF), a paramilitary organisation opposed to the implementation of Home Rule.\n\nUnionists were in a minority in Ireland as a whole, but in the northern province of Ulster they were a very large majority in County Antrim and County Down, small majorities in County Armagh and County Londonderry and a substantial minority in the rest of the province.  These four counties, as well as County Fermanagh and County Tyrone, would later constitute Northern Ireland. Most of the remaining 26 counties which later became the Republic of Ireland were overwhelmingly majority-nationalist.\n\nDuring the Home Rule Crisis the possibility was discussed of a \"temporary\" partition of these six counties from the rest of Ireland. In 1914, the Third Home Rule Bill received Royal Assent as the Government of Ireland Act 1914. However, its implementation was suspended before it came into effect because of the outbreak of the First World War, and the Amending Bill to partition Ireland was abandoned. The war was expected to last only a few weeks but in fact lasted four years. By the end of the war (during which the 1916 Easter Rising had taken place), the Act was seen as unimplementable. Public opinion among nationalists had shifted during the war from a demand for home rule to one for full independence. In 1919, David Lloyd George proposed a new bill which would divide Ireland into two Home Rule areas: twenty-six counties being ruled from Dublin and six being ruled from Belfast. Straddling these two areas would be a shared Lord Lieutenant of Ireland who would appoint both governments and a Council of Ireland, which Lloyd George believed would evolve into an all-Ireland parliament. \n\nEvents overtook the government. In the general election of 1918, the pro-independence Sinn Féin won 73 of the 105 parliamentary seats in Ireland and unilaterally established the First Dáil, an extrajudicial parliament in Ireland. Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland in 1921 under the terms of Lloyd George's Government of Ireland Act 1920  during the Anglo-Irish War between Irish republican and British forces. The war ended on 6 December 1921, with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which created the Irish Free State. Under the terms of the treaty, Northern Ireland would become part of the Free State unless the government opted out by presenting an address to the king, although in practice partition remained in place. \n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nAs expected, the Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland resolved on 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State) to exercise its right to opt out of the Free State by making an address to the King.  The text of the address was:  Shortly afterwards, the Boundary Commission was established to decide on the territorial boundaries between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Owing to the outbreak of civil war in the Free State, the work of the commission was delayed until 1925. Leaders in Dublin expected a substantial reduction in the territory of Northern Ireland, with nationalist areas moving to the Free State. However the commission's report recommended only that some small portions of land should be ceded from Northern Ireland to the Free State and even that a small amount of land should be ceded from the Free State to Northern Ireland. To prevent argument, this report was suppressed and, in exchange for a waiver to the Free State's obligations to the UK's public debt and the dissolution of the Council of Ireland (sought by the Government of Northern Ireland), the initial six-county border was maintained with no changes.\n\nIn June 1940, to encourage the neutral Irish state to join with the Allies, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill indicated to the Taoiseach Éamon de Valera that the United Kingdom would push for Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer.  The British did not inform the Government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Dublin government, and De Valera's rejection was not publicised until 1970.\n\nThe Ireland Act 1949 gave the first legal guarantee that the region would not cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Troubles\n\nThe Troubles, which started in the late 1960s, consisted of about thirty years of recurring acts of intense violence during which 3,254 people were killed  with over 50,000 casualties.  From 1969 to 2003 there were over 36,900 shooting incidents and over 16,200 bombings or attempted bombings associated with The Troubles.  The conflict was caused by the disputed status of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom and the discrimination against the Irish nationalist minority by the dominant unionist majority.  From 1967 to 1972 the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), which modelled itself on the US civil rights movement, led a campaign of civil resistance to anti-Catholic discrimination in housing, employment, policing, and electoral procedures. The franchise for local government elections included only rate-payers and their spouses, and so excluded over a quarter of the electorate. While the majority of disenfranchised electors were Protestant, but Catholics were over-represented since they were poorer and had more adults still living in the family home. \n\nNICRA's campaign, seen by many unionists as an Irish republican front, and the violent reaction to it, proved to be a precursor to a more violent period.  As early as 1969, armed campaigns of paramilitary groups began, including the Provisional IRA campaign of 1969–1997 which was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland and the creation of a United Ireland, and the Ulster Volunteer Force, formed in 1966 in response to the perceived erosion of both the British character and unionist domination of Northern Ireland. The state security forces – the British Army and the police (the Royal Ulster Constabulary) – were also involved in the violence. The British government's position is that its forces were neutral in the conflict, trying to uphold law and order in Northern Ireland and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to democratic self-determination. Republicans regarded the state forces as combatants in the conflict, pointing to the collusion between the state forces and the loyalist paramilitaries as proof of this.  The \"Ballast\" investigation by the Police Ombudsman has confirmed that British forces, and in particular the RUC, did collude with loyalist paramilitaries, were involved in murder, and did obstruct the course of justice when such claims had been investigated,  although the extent to which such collusion occurred is still hotly disputed.\n\nAs a consequence of the worsening security situation, autonomous regional government for Northern Ireland was suspended in 1972. Alongside the violence, there was a political deadlock between the major political parties in Northern Ireland, including those who condemned violence, over the future status of Northern Ireland and the form of government there should be within Northern Ireland. In 1973, Northern Ireland held a referendum to determine if it should remain in the United Kingdom, or be part of a united Ireland. The vote went heavily in favour (98.9%) of maintaining the status quo. Approximately 57.5% of the total electorate voted in support, but only 1% of Catholics voted following a boycott organised by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). \n\nPeace process\n\nThe Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a peace process which included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations and the complete decommissioning of their weapons, the reform of the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of army troops from the streets and from sensitive border areas such as South Armagh and Fermanagh, as agreed by the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the \"Good Friday Agreement\"). This reiterated the long-held British position, which had never before been fully acknowledged by successive Irish governments, that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom until a majority of voters in Northern Ireland decides otherwise. The Constitution of Ireland was amended in 1999 to remove a claim of the \"Irish nation\" to sovereignty over the whole of Ireland (in Article 2), a claim qualified by an acknowledgement that Ireland could only exercise legal control over the territory formerly known as the Irish Free State.\n\nThe new Articles 2 and 3, added to the Constitution to replace the earlier articles, implicitly acknowledge that the status of Northern Ireland, and its relationships within the rest of the United Kingdom and with the Republic of Ireland, would only be changed with the agreement of a majority of voters in each  jurisdiction. This aspect was also central to the Belfast Agreement which was signed in 1998 and ratified by referendums held simultaneously in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. At the same time, the British Government recognised for the first time, as part of the prospective, the so-called \"Irish dimension\": the principle that the people of the island of Ireland as a whole have the right, without any outside interference, to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.  The latter statement was key to winning support for the agreement from nationalists. It established a devolved power-sharing government within Northern Ireland, which must consist of both unionist and nationalist parties. These institutions were suspended by the British Government in 2002 after Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) allegations of spying by people working for Sinn Féin at the Assembly (Stormontgate). The resulting case against the accused Sinn Féin member collapsed.  \n\nOn 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA declared an end to its campaign and has since decommissioned what is thought to be all of its arsenal. This final act of decommissioning was performed in accordance with the Belfast Agreement of 1998, and under the watch of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and two external church witnesses. Many unionists, however, remain sceptical. The International Commission later confirmed that the main loyalist paramilitary groups, the UDA, UVF and the Red Hand Commando, had decommissioned what is thought to be all of their arsenals, witnessed by a former Archbishop and a former top civil servant. \n\nPoliticians elected to the Assembly at the 2003 Assembly election were called together on 15 May 2006 under the Northern Ireland Act 2006  for the purpose of electing a First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland and choosing the members of an Executive (before 25 November 2006) as a preliminary step to the restoration of devolved government.\n\nFollowing the election held on 7 March 2007, devolved government returned on 8 May 2007 with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley and Sinn Féin deputy leader Martin McGuinness taking office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively. \n\nPolitics\n\nBackground\n\nThe main political divide in Northern Ireland is between unionists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland unified with the Republic of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom.  These two opposing views are linked to deeper cultural divisions. Unionists are predominantly Ulster Protestant, descendants of mainly Scottish, English, and Huguenot settlers as well as Gaels who converted to one of the Protestant denominations. Nationalists are overwhelmingly Catholic and descend from the population predating the settlement, with a minority from the Scottish Highlands as well as some converts from Protestantism. Discrimination against nationalists under the Stormont government (1921–1972) gave rise to the civil rights movement in the 1960s. \n\nWhile some unionists argue that  discrimination was not just due to religious or political bigotry, but also the result of more complex socio-economic, socio-political and geographical factors.  its existence, and the manner in which nationalist anger at it was handled, were a major contributing factor to the Troubles. The political unrest went through its most violent phase between 1968 and 1994. \n\nIn 2007, 36% of the population defined themselves as unionist, 24% as nationalist and 40% defined themselves as neither.  According to a 2009 opinion poll, 69% express a long-term preference of the maintenance of Northern Ireland's membership of the United Kingdom (either directly ruled or with devolved government), while 21% express a preference for membership of a united Ireland.  This discrepancy can be explained by the overwhelming preference among Protestants to remain a part of the UK (91%), while Catholic preferences are spread across a number of solutions to the constitutional question including remaining a part of the UK (47%), a united Ireland (40%), Northern Ireland becoming an independent state (5%), and those who \"don't know\" (5%). \n\nOfficial voting figures, which reflect views on the \"national question\" along with issues of candidate, geography, personal loyalty and historic voting patterns, show 54% of Northern Ireland voters vote for unionist parties, 42% vote for nationalist parties and 4% vote \"other\". Opinion polls consistently show that the election results are not necessarily an indication of the electorate's stance regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Most of the population of Northern Ireland are at least nominally Christian, mostly Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations. Many voters (regardless of religious affiliation) are attracted to unionism's conservative policies, while other voters are instead attracted to the traditionally leftist Sinn Féin and SDLP and their respective party platforms for democratic socialism and social democracy. \n\nFor the most part, Protestants feel a strong connection with Great Britain and wish for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Many Catholics however, generally aspire to a United Ireland or are less certain about how to solve the constitutional question. In the 2009 survey by Northern Ireland Life and Times, 47% of Northern Irish Catholics supported Northern Ireland remaining a part of the United Kingdom, either by direct rule (8%) or devolved government (39%).\n\nProtestants have a slight majority in Northern Ireland, according to the latest Northern Ireland Census. The make-up of the Northern Ireland Assembly reflects the appeals of the various parties within the population. Of the 108 MLAs, 56 are unionists and 43 are nationalists (the remaining nine are classified as \"other\").\n\nGovernance\n\nSince 1998, Northern Ireland has had devolved government within the United Kingdom. The UK Government and UK Parliament are responsible for reserved and excepted matters. Reserved matters comprise listed policy areas (such as civil aviation, units of measurement, and human genetics) that Parliament may devolve to Northern Ireland Assembly at some time in the future. Excepted matters (such as international relations, taxation and elections) are never expected to be considered for devolution. On all other governmental matters, the Northern Ireland Executive together with the 108-member Northern Ireland Assembly may legislate for and govern Northern Ireland. Devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland executive in the North/South Ministerial Council, which co-ordinates areas of co-operation (such as agriculture, education and health) between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Additionally, \"in recognition of the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland\", the Government of Ireland and Government of the United Kingdom co-operate closely on non-devolved matters through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.\n\nElections to the Northern Ireland Assembly are by single transferable vote with six representatives (Member of the Legislative Assembly, MLAs) elected from 18 parliamentary constituencies. Eighteen representatives to the lower house of the UK parliament (Members of Parliament, MPs) are elected from the same constituencies using the first-past-the-post system. However, not all of these take their seats. Sinn Féin MPs, currently five, refuse to take the oath to serve the Queen that is required before MPs are allowed to take their seats. In addition, the upper house of the UK parliament, the House of Lords, currently has some 25 appointed members from Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland itself forms a single constituency for elections to the European Parliament.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Office represents the UK government in Northern Ireland on reserved matters and represents Northern Ireland's interests within the UK Government. Additionally, the Republic's government also has the right to \"put forward views and proposals\" on non-devolved matters in relation to Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office is led by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who sits in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.\n\nNorthern Ireland is a distinct legal jurisdiction, separate from the two other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom (England and Wales, and Scotland). Northern Ireland law developed from Irish law that existed before the partition of Ireland in 1921. Northern Ireland is a common law jurisdiction and its common law is similar to that in England and Wales. However, there are important differences in law and procedure between Northern Ireland and England and Wales. The body of statute law affecting Northern Ireland reflects the history of Northern Ireland, including Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the former Parliament of Northern Ireland and the Parliament of Ireland, along with some Acts of the Parliament of England and of the Parliament of Great Britain that were extended to Ireland under Poynings' Law between 1494 and 1782.\n\nDescriptionsThere is no generally accepted term to describe what Northern Ireland is: province, region, country or something else. The choice of term can be controversial and can reveal the writer's political preferences. This has been noted as a problem by several writers on Northern Ireland, with no generally recommended solution.\n\nOwing in part to the way in which the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, came into being, there is no legally defined term to describe what Northern Ireland 'is'. There is also no uniform or guiding way to refer to Northern Ireland amongst the agencies of the UK government. For example, the websites of the Office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the UK Statistics Authority describe the United Kingdom as being made up of four countries, one of these being Northern Ireland. Other pages on the same websites refer to Northern Ireland specifically as a \"province\" as do publications of the UK Statistics Authority.   The website of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency also refers to Northern Ireland as being a province  as does the website of the Office of Public Sector Information  and other agencies within Northern Ireland.  Publications of HM Treasury  and the Department of Finance and Personnel of the Northern Ireland Executive,  on the other hand, describe Northern Ireland as being a \"region of the UK\". The UK's submission to the 2007 United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names defines the UK as being made up of two countries (England and Scotland), one principality (Wales) and one province (Northern Ireland). \n\nUnlike England, Scotland and Wales, Northern Ireland has no history of being an independent country or of being a nation in its own right.   Some writers describe the United Kingdom as being made up of three countries and one province  or point out the difficulties with calling Northern Ireland a country.  Authors writing specifically about Northern Ireland dismiss the idea that Northern Ireland is a \"country\" in general terms,   and draw contrasts in this respect with England, Scotland and Wales.  Even for the period covering the first 50 years of Northern Ireland's existence, the term country is considered inappropriate by some political scientists on the basis that many decisions were still made in London. The absence of a distinct nation of Northern Ireland, separate within the island of Ireland, is also pointed out as being a problem with using the term   and is in contrast to England, Scotland, and Wales. \n\nMany commentators prefer to use the term \"province\", although that is also not without problems. It can arouse irritation, particularly among nationalists, for whom the title province is properly reserved for the traditional province of Ulster, of which Northern Ireland comprises six out of nine counties. The BBC style guide is to refer to Northern Ireland as a province, and use of the term is common in literature and newspaper reports on Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Some authors have described the meaning of this term as being equivocal: referring to Northern Ireland as being a province both of the United Kingdom and of the traditional country of Ireland.\n\n\"Region\" is used by several UK government agencies and the European Union. Some authors choose this word but note that it is \"unsatisfactory\". Northern Ireland can also be simply described as \"part of the UK\", including by UK government offices.\n\nAlternative names\n\nMany people inside and outside Northern Ireland use other names for Northern Ireland, depending on their point of view. Disagreement on names, and the reading of political symbolism into the use or non-use of a word, also attaches itself to some urban centres. The most notable example is whether Northern Ireland's second city should be called \"Derry\" or \"Londonderry\".\n\nChoice of language and nomenclature in Northern Ireland often reveals the cultural, ethnic and religious identity of the speaker. The first Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Seamus Mallon, was criticised by unionist politicians for calling the region the \"North of Ireland\" while Sinn Féin has been criticised in a Dublin newspaper for referring to the \"Six Counties\". \n\nThose who do not belong to any group but lean towards one side often tend to use the language of that group. Supporters of unionism in the British media (notably The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Express) regularly call Northern Ireland \"Ulster\".  Some media outlets in the Republic use \"North of Ireland\", \"the North\", or (less often) the \"Six Counties\".\n\nGovernment and cultural organisations in Northern Ireland often use the word \"Ulster\" in their title; for example, the University of Ulster, the Ulster Museum, the Ulster Orchestra, and BBC Radio Ulster.\n\nAlthough some news bulletins since the 1990s have opted to avoid all contentious terms and use the official name, Northern Ireland, the term \"the North\" remains commonly used by broadcast media in the Republic. For Northern Ireland's second largest city, broadcasting outlets which are unaligned to either community and broadcast to both use both names interchangeably, often starting a report with \"Londonderry\" and then using \"Derry\" in the rest of the report. However, within Northern Ireland, print media which are aligned to either ideology (the Belfast Telegraph and News Letter are unionist in outlook while the Irish News is nationalist) generally use their preferred term. British newspapers with unionist leanings, such as The Daily Telegraph, usually use unionist language. However the more left-wing Guardian recommends in its style guide using \"Derry\" and \"County Derry\", and \"not Londonderry\". \n\nThe division in nomenclature is sometimes seen in the names of organisations associated with either side of the political divide, but there are exceptions. In Gaelic games, followed mainly by nationalists, the GAA county is \"Derry\", but in sports followed mainly by unionists, clubs tend to avoid the use of \"Londonderry\" in favour of more precise locales (Glendermott Cricket Club) or neutral terms (Foyle Hockey Club). \"Derry\" is also used in the names of both the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic dioceses, and by one of the largest Protestant fraternal societies, the Apprentice Boys of Derry. There is no agreement on how to decide on a name. When the nationalist-controlled local council voted to rename the city \"Derry\", unionists objected, stating that as it owed its city status to a Royal Charter, only a charter issued by the Queen could change the name. The Queen has not intervened on the matter and thus the council is now called the Derry City Council while the city is still officially Londonderry. Nevertheless, the council has printed two sets of stationery—one for each term—and its policy is to reply to correspondence using whichever term the original sender used.\n\nUnionist (usually Protestant)\n\n* Ulster, strictly speaking, refers to the province of Ulster, of which six of nine historical counties are in Northern Ireland. The term \"Ulster\" is widely used by unionists and the British press as shorthand for Northern Ireland, and is also favoured by Ulster nationalists.  In the past, calls have been made for Northern Ireland's name to be changed to Ulster. This proposal was formally considered by the Government of Northern Ireland in 1937 and by the UK Government in 1949 but no change was made. \n* The Province refers to the historic Irish province of Ulster but today is used by some as shorthand for Northern Ireland. The BBC, in its editorial guidance for Reporting the United Kingdom, states that \"the Province\" is an appropriate secondary synonym for Northern Ireland, while \"Ulster\" is not. It also suggests that \"people of Northern Ireland\" is preferred to \"British\" or \"Irish\", and the term \"mainland\" should be avoided in reference to Great Britain in relation to Northern Ireland. \n\nNationalist (usually Catholic)\n\n*North of Ireland – used to avoid using the name given by the British-enacted Government of Ireland Act 1920.\n* The Six Counties (Irish: na Sé Chontae) – the Republic of Ireland is similarly described as the Twenty-Six Counties.  Some of the users of these terms contend that using the official name of the region would imply acceptance of the legitimacy of the Government of Ireland Act. \n* The Occupied Six Counties – used by republicans.  The Republic, whose legitimacy is similarly not recognised by republicans opposed to the Belfast Agreement, is described as the \"Free State\", referring to the Irish Free State, which gained independence (as a Dominion) in 1922. \n* British-Occupied Ireland – Similar in tone to the Occupied Six Counties,  this term is used by more dogmatic republicans, such as Republican Sinn Féin,  who still hold that the Second Dáil was the last legitimate government of Ireland and that all governments since have been foreign-imposed usurpations of Irish national self-determination. \n\nOther\n\n* Norn Iron – is an informal and affectionate  local nickname used by both nationalists and unionists to refer to Northern Ireland, derived from the pronunciation of the words \"Northern Ireland\" in an exaggerated Ulster accent (particularly one from the greater Belfast area). The phrase is seen as a lighthearted way to refer to Northern Ireland, based as it is on regional pronunciation. Often refers to the Northern Ireland national football team. \n\nGeography and climate\n\n-3°C isotherm used to distinguish temperate (C) and continental (D) climates.\n\nNorthern Ireland was covered by an ice sheet for most of the last ice age and on numerous previous occasions, the legacy of which can be seen in the extensive coverage of drumlins in Counties Fermanagh, Armagh, Antrim and particularly Down.\n\nThe centrepiece of Northern Ireland's geography is Lough Neagh, at 151 sqmi the largest freshwater lake both on the island of Ireland and in the British Isles. A second extensive lake system is centred on Lower and Upper Lough Erne in Fermanagh. The largest island of Northern Ireland is Rathlin, off the north Antrim coast. Strangford Lough is the largest inlet in the British Isles, covering 150 km2.\n\nThere are substantial uplands in the Sperrin Mountains (an extension of the Caledonian mountain belt) with extensive gold deposits, granite Mourne Mountains and basalt Antrim Plateau, as well as smaller ranges in South Armagh and along the Fermanagh–Tyrone border. None of the hills are especially high, with Slieve Donard in the dramatic Mournes reaching 850 m, Northern Ireland's highest point. Belfast's most prominent peak is Cavehill.\n\nThe volcanic activity which created the Antrim Plateau also formed the eerily geometric pillars of the Giant's Causeway on the north Antrim coast. Also in north Antrim are the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, Mussenden Temple and the Glens of Antrim.\n\nThe Lower and Upper River Bann, River Foyle and River Blackwater form extensive fertile lowlands, with excellent arable land also found in North and East Down, although much of the hill country is marginal and suitable largely for animal husbandry.\n\nThe valley of the River Lagan is dominated by Belfast, whose metropolitan area includes over a third of the population of Northern Ireland, with heavy urbanisation and industrialisation along the Lagan Valley and both shores of Belfast Lough.\n\nThe whole of Northern Ireland has a temperate maritime climate, rather wetter in the west than the east, although cloud cover is persistent across the region. The weather is unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America. Average daytime maximums in Belfast are  in January and  in July. The highest maximum temperature recorded was  at Knockarevan, near Garrison, County Fermanagh on 30 June 1976 and at Belfast on 12 July 1983.  The lowest minimum temperature recorded was  at Castlederg, County Tyrone on 23 December 2010.\n\nCounties\n\nNorthern Ireland consists of six historic counties: County Antrim, County Armagh, County Down, County Fermanagh, County Londonderry,  County Tyrone.\n\nThese counties are no longer used for local government purposes; instead there are eleven districts of Northern Ireland which have different geographical extents. These were created in 2015, replacing the twenty-six districts which previously existed. \n\nAlthough counties are no longer used for local governmental purposes, they remain a popular means of describing where places are. They are officially used while applying for an Irish passport, which requires one to state one's county of birth. The name of that county then appears in both Irish and English on the passport's information page, as opposed to the town or city of birth on the United Kingdom passport. The Gaelic Athletic Association still uses the counties as its primary means of organisation and fields representative teams of each GAA county. The original system of car registration numbers largely based on counties still remains in use. In 2000, the telephone numbering system was restructured into an 8 digit scheme with (except for Belfast) the first digit approximately reflecting the county.\n\nThe county boundaries still appear on Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland Maps and the Phillips Street Atlases, among others. With their decline in official use, there is often confusion surrounding towns and cities which lie near county boundaries, such as Belfast and Lisburn, which are split between counties Down and Antrim (the majorities of both cities, however, are in Antrim).\n\nEconomy\n\nNorthern Ireland has traditionally had an industrial economy, most notably in shipbuilding, rope manufacture and textiles, but most heavy industry has since been replaced by services, primarily the public sector. Government subsidies account for 20% of the economy's revenue.\n\nSeventy percent of the economy's revenue comes from the service sector. Apart from the public sector, another important service sector is tourism, which rose to account for over 1% of the economy's revenue in 2004. Tourism has been a major growth area since the end of the Troubles. Key tourism attractions include the historic cities of Derry, Belfast and Armagh and the many castles in Northern Ireland. More recently, the economy has benefited from major investment by many large multi-national corporations into high tech industry. These large firms are attracted by government subsidies and the skilled workforce in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe local economy has seen contraction during the Great Recession. In response, the Northern Ireland Assembly has sent trade missions abroad. The Executive wishes to gain taxation powers from London, in order to align Northern Ireland's corporation tax rate with the unusually low rate of the Republic of Ireland.\n\nTransport\n\nNorthern Ireland has underdeveloped transport infrastructure, with most infrastructure concentrated around Greater Belfast, Greater Derry and Craigavon.  Northern Ireland is served by three airports – Belfast International near Antrim, George Best Belfast City integrated into the railway network at Sydenham in East Belfast, and City of Derry in County Londonderry.\n\nMajor sea ports at Larne and Belfast carry passengers and freight between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nPassenger railways are operated by Northern Ireland Railways. With Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail), Northern Ireland Railways co-operates in providing the joint Enterprise service between Dublin Connolly and Belfast Central. Southwestern Ulster is the most sparsely railed region in Ireland. While a rail service existed in the early twentieth century, all five counties that now lack a railway are located here, including two in Northern Ireland, Fermanagh and Tyrone. Main railway lines linking to and from Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station and Belfast Central are:\n\n* The Derry Line and the Portrush Branch.\n* The Larne Line\n* The Bangor Line\n* The Portadown Line\n\nMain motorways are:\n* M1 connecting Belfast to the south and west, ending in Dungannon\n* M12 connecting the M1 to Portadown\n* M2 connecting Belfast to the north.  An unconnected section of the M2 also by-passes Ballymena\n* M22 connecting the M2 to near Randalstown\n* M3 connecting the M1 and M2 in Belfast with the A2 dual carriageway to Bangor\n* M5 connecting Belfast to Newtownabbey\n\nThe cross-border road connecting the ports of Larne in Northern Ireland and Rosslare Harbour in the Republic of Ireland is being upgraded as part of an EU-funded scheme. European route E01 runs from Larne through the island of Ireland, Spain and Portugal to Seville.\n\nDemography\n\nThe population of Northern Ireland has risen yearly since 1978. The population in 2011 was 1.8 million, having grown 7.5% over the previous decade  from just under 1.7 million in 2001. This constitutes just under 3% of the population of the UK (62 million) and just over 28% of the population of the island of Ireland (6.3 million).\n\nThe population of Northern Ireland is almost entirely white (98.2%). In 2011, 88.8% of the population were born in Northern Ireland, with 4.5% born in Britain, and 2.9% born in the Republic of Ireland. 4.3% were born elsewhere; triple the amount there were in 2001.  Most are from Eastern Europe and Baltic states. The largest non-white ethnic groups were Chinese (6,300) and Indian (6,200). Black people of various origins made up 0.2% of the 2011 population and people of mixed ethnicity made up 0.2%.\n\nIn the 2011 census, 41.5% of the population identified as belonging to Protestant or other non-Roman Catholic Christian denominations. The biggest of these denominations were the Presbyterian Church (19%), the Church of Ireland (14%) and the Methodist Church (3%). The largest single denomination is the Roman Catholic Church, to which 41% of the population belonged. 0.8% identified with non-Christian religions or philosophies, while 17% identified with no religion or did not state one.  In terms of community background (i.e. religion or religion brought up in), 48% of the population came from a Protestant background, 45% from a Catholic background, 0.9% from non-Christian backgrounds, and 5.6% from non-religious backgrounds.\n\nCitizenship and identity\n\nIn the 2011 census in Northern Ireland respondents gave their national identity as follows. \n\nSeveral studies and surveys carried out between 1971 and 2006 have indicated that, in general, most Protestants in Northern Ireland see themselves primarily as British, whereas a majority of Roman Catholics regard themselves primarily as Irish.         This does not however account for the complex identities within Northern Ireland, given that many of the population regard themselves as \"Ulster\" or \"Northern Irish\", either as a primary or secondary identity. Overall, the Catholic population is somewhat more ethnically diverse than the more homogeneous Protestant population. Fully 83.1% of Protestants identified as \"British\" or with a British ethnic group (English, Scottish, or Welsh) in the 2011 Census, whereas only 3.9% identified as \"Irish\". Meanwhile, 13.7% of Catholics identified as \"British\" or with a British ethnic group; a further 4.4% identified as \"all other\", which are largely immigrants, for example from Poland.\n\nA 2008 survey found that 57% of Protestants described themselves as British, while 32% identified as Northern Irish, 6% as Ulster and 4% as Irish. Compared to a similar survey carried out in 1998, this shows a fall in the percentage of Protestants identifying as British and Ulster, and a rise in those identifying as Northern Irish. The 2008 survey found that 61% of Catholics described themselves as Irish, with 25% identifying as Northern Irish, 8% as British and 1% as Ulster. These figures were largely unchanged from the 1998 results.  \n\nPeople born in Northern Ireland are, with some exceptions, deemed by UK law to be citizens of the United Kingdom. They are also, with similar exceptions, entitled to be citizens of Ireland. This entitlement was reaffirmed in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement between the British and Irish governments, which provides that:\n\n...it is the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly [the two governments] confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.\n\nAs a result of the Agreement, the Constitution of the Republic of Ireland was amended. The current wording provides that people born in Northern Ireland are entitled to be Irish citizens on the same basis as people from any other part of the island. \n\nNeither government, however, extends its citizenship to all persons born in Northern Ireland. Both governments exclude some people born in Northern Ireland, in particular persons born without one parent who is a British or Irish citizen. The Irish restriction was given effect by the twenty-seventh amendment to the Irish Constitution in 2004. The position in UK nationality law is that most of those born in Northern Ireland are UK nationals, whether or not they so choose. Renunciation of British citizenship requires the payment of a fee, currently £229. \n\nIn the 2011 census in Northern Ireland respondents stated that they held the following passports. \n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish is spoken as a first language by almost all of the Northern Ireland population. It is the de facto official language and the Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737 prohibits the use of languages other than English in legal proceedings.\n\nUnder the Good Friday Agreement, Irish and Ulster Scots (an Ulster dialect of the Scots language, sometimes known as Ullans), are recognised as \"part of the cultural wealth of Northern Ireland\".  Two all-island bodies for the promotion of these were created under the Agreement: Foras na Gaeilge, which promotes the Irish language, and the Ulster Scots Agency, which promotes the Ulster Scots dialect and culture. These operate separately under the aegis of the North/South Language Body, which reports to the North/South Ministerial Council.\n\nThe British government in 2001 ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, with a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters. A lower level of recognition was accorded to Ulster Scots, under Part II of the Charter. \n\nEnglish\n\nThe dialect of English spoken in Northern Ireland shows influence from the lowland Scots language.  There are supposedly some minute differences in pronunciation between Protestants and Catholics, the best known of which is the name of the letter h, which Protestants tend to pronounce as \"aitch\", as in British English, and Catholics tend to pronounce as \"haitch\", as in Hiberno-English. However, geography is a much more important determinant of dialect than religious background.\n\nIrish\n\nThe Irish language (), or Gaelic, is a native language of Ireland.  It was spoken predominantly throughout what is now Northern Ireland before the Ulster Plantations in the 17th century and most place names in Northern Ireland are anglicised versions of a Gaelic name. Today, the language is often associated with Irish nationalism (and thus with Catholics). However, in the 19th century, the language was seen as a common heritage, with Ulster Protestants playing a leading role in the Gaelic revival.\n\nIn the 2011 census, 11% of the population of Northern Ireland claimed \"some knowledge of Irish\" and 3.7% reported being able to \"speak, read, write and understand\" Irish.  In another survey, from 1999, 1% of respondents said they spoke it as their main language at home.Northern Ireland LIFE & TIMES Survey: [http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/MAINLANG.html What is the main language spoken in your own home?]\n\nThe dialect spoken in Northern Ireland, Ulster Irish, has two main types, East Ulster Irish and Donegal Irish (or West Ulster Irish),  is the one closest to Scottish Gaelic (which developed into a separate language from Irish Gaelic in the 17th century). Some words and phrases are shared with Scots Gaelic, and the dialects of east Ulster – those of Rathlin Island and the Glens of Antrim – were very similar to the dialect of Argyll, the part of Scotland nearest to Ireland. And those dialects of Armagh and Down were also very similar to the dialects of Galloway.\n\nUse of the Irish language in Northern Ireland today is politically sensitive. The erection by some district councils of bilingual street names in both English and Irish,  invariably in predominantly nationalist districts, is resisted by unionists who claim that it creates a \"chill factor\" and thus harms community relationships. Efforts by members of the Northern Ireland Assembly to legislate for some official uses of the language have failed to achieve the required cross-community support, and the UK government has declined to legislate. There has recently been an increase in interest in the language among unionists in East Belfast. \n\nUlster Scots\n\nUlster Scots comprises varieties of the Scots language spoken in Northern Ireland. For a native English speaker, \"[Ulster Scots] is comparatively accessible, and even at its most intense can be understood fairly easily with the help of a glossary.\"Aodan Mac Poilin, 1999, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/history/stateapart/agreement/culture/support/cul2_c011.shtml \"Language, Identity and Politics in Northern Ireland\"] in Ulster Folk Life Vol. 45, 1999\n\nAlong with the Irish language, the Good Friday Agreement recognised the dialect as part of Northern Ireland's unique culture and the St Andrews Agreement recognised the need to \"enhance and develop the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture\". \n\nApproximately 2% of the population claim to speak Ulster Scots.  However, the number speaking it as their main language in their home is negligible, with only 0.9% of 2011 census respondents claiming to be able to speak, read, write and understand Ulster-Scots. 8.1% professed to have \"some ability\" however.\n\nSign languages\n\nThe most common sign language in Northern Ireland is Northern Ireland Sign Language (NISL). However, because in the past Catholic families tended to send their deaf children to schools in Dublin where Irish Sign Language (ISL) is commonly used. ISL is still common among many older deaf people from Catholic families.\n\nIrish Sign Language (ISL) has some influence from the French family of sign language, which includes American Sign Language (ASL). NISL takes a large component from the British family of sign language (which also includes Auslan) with many borrowings from ASL. It is described as being related to Irish Sign Language at the syntactic level while much of the lexicon is based on British Sign Language (BSL)  and American Sign Language.\n\n the British Government recognises only British Sign Language and Irish Sign Language as the official sign languages used in Northern Ireland.  \n\nCulture\n\nNorthern Ireland shares both the culture of Ireland and the culture of the United Kingdom. Those of Catholic background tend to identity more with Irish culture, and those of Protestant background more with British culture. This has caused the two communities to become pillarised.\n\nParades are a prominent feature of Northern Ireland society,  more so than in the rest of Ireland or in Britain. Most are held by Protestant fraternities such as the Orange Order, and Ulster loyalist marching bands. Each summer, during the \"marching season\", these groups have hundreds of parades, deck streets with British flags, bunting and specially-made arches, and light large towering bonfires.Bryan, Dominic. Orange Parades: The Politics of Ritual, Tradition and Control. Pluto Press, 2000. p.130 The biggest parades are held on 12 July (The Twelfth). There is often tension when these activities take place near Catholic neighbourhoods, which sometimes leads to violence. \n\nSince the end of the Troubles, Northern Ireland has witnessed rising numbers of tourists. Attractions include cultural festivals, musical and artistic traditions, countryside and geographical sites of interest, public houses, welcoming hospitality and sports (especially golf and fishing). Since 1987 public houses have been allowed to open on Sundays, despite some opposition.\n\nThe Ulster Cycle is a large body of prose and verse centring on the traditional heroes of the Ulaid in what is now eastern Ulster. This is one of the four major cycles of Irish mythology. The cycle centres on the reign of Conchobar mac Nessa, who is said to have been king of Ulster around the 1st century. He ruled from Emain Macha (now Navan Fort near Armagh), and had a fierce rivalry with queen Medb and king Ailill of Connacht and their ally, Fergus mac Róich, former king of Ulster. The foremost hero of the cycle is Conchobar's nephew Cúchulainn.\n\nSymbols\n\nNorthern Ireland comprises a patchwork of communities whose national loyalties are represented in some areas by flags flown from flagpoles or lamp posts. The Union Jack and the former Northern Ireland flag are flown in many loyalist areas, and the Tricolour, adopted by republicans as the flag of Ireland in 1916, is flown in some republican areas. Even kerbstones in some areas are painted red-white-blue or green-white-orange, depending on whether local people express unionist/loyalist or nationalist/republican sympathies. \n\nThe official flag is that of the state having sovereignty over the territory, i.e. the Union Flag.  The former Northern Ireland flag, also known as the \"Ulster Banner\" or \"Red Hand Flag\", is a banner derived from the coat of arms of the Government of Northern Ireland until 1972. Since 1972, it has had no official status. The Union Flag and the Ulster Banner are used exclusively by unionists. UK flags policy states that in Northern Ireland, \"The Ulster flag and the Cross of St Patrick have no official status and, under the Flags Regulations, are not permitted to be flown from Government Buildings.\"  \n\nThe Irish Rugby Football Union and the Church of Ireland have used the Saint Patrick's Saltire or \"Cross of St Patrick\". This red saltire on a white field was used to represent Ireland in the flag of the United Kingdom. It is still used by some British army regiments. Foreign flags are also found, such as the Palestinian flags in some nationalist areas and Israeli flags in some unionist areas. \n\nThe United Kingdom national anthem of \"God Save the Queen\" is often played at state events in Northern Ireland. At the Commonwealth Games and some other sporting events, the Northern Ireland team uses the Ulster Banner as its flag—notwithstanding its lack of official status—and the Londonderry Air (usually set to lyrics as Danny Boy), which also has no official status, as its national anthem.   The national football team also uses the Ulster Banner as its flag but uses \"God Save The Queen\" as its anthem. \nMajor Gaelic Athletic Association matches are opened by the Irish national anthem, \"Amhrán na bhFiann (The Soldier's Song)\", which is also used by most other all-Ireland sporting organisations. \nSince 1995, the Ireland rugby union team has used a specially commissioned song, \"Ireland's Call\" as the team's anthem. The Irish national anthem is also played at Dublin home matches, being the anthem of the host country. \n\nNorthern Irish murals have become well-known features of Northern Ireland, depicting past and present events and documenting peace and cultural diversity. Almost 2,000 murals have been documented in Northern Ireland since the 1970s.\n\nSport\n\nIn Northern Ireland, sport is popular and important in the lives of many people. Sports tend to be organised on an all-Ireland basis, with a single team for the whole island.  The most notable exception is association football, which has separate governing bodies for each jurisdiction.\n\nField sports\n\nAssociation football\n\nThe Irish Football Association (IFA) is the organising body for association football in Northern Ireland, with the Northern Ireland Football League (NIFL) responsible for the independent administration of the three divisions of national domestic football, as well as the Northern Ireland Football League Cup. NIFL clubs are semi-professional i.e. part-time or amateur.\n\nThe highest level of competition within Northern Ireland is the NIFL Premiership, with the NIFL Championship below. However, the best Northern Irish players tend to play for clubs in the English or Scottish leagues with full-time professional clubs.\n\nThere is also an all-island tournament, the Setanta Sports Cup, which includes six NIFL Premiership teams and six teams from the Republic's League of Ireland Premier Division.\n\nDespite Northern Ireland's small population, the national team qualified for the World Cup in 1958, 1982 and 1986, making it to the quarter-finals in 1958 and 1982.\n\nRugby union\n\nThe six counties of Northern Ireland are among the nine governed by the Ulster branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union, the governing body of rugby union in Ireland.  Ulster is one of the four professional provincial teams in Ireland and competes in the Celtic League and European Cup. It won the European Cup in 1999.\n\nIn international competitions, the Ireland national rugby union team's recent successes include four Triple Crowns between 2004 and 2009 and a Grand Slam in 2009 in the Six Nations Championship.\n\nCricket\n\nThe Ireland cricket team is an associate member of the International Cricket Council. It participated in 2007 Cricket World Cup and qualified for the Super 8s and did the same in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20.\n\nIreland are current champions of ICC Intercontinental Cup. One of Ireland's regular international venues is Stormont in Belfast.\n\nGaelic games\n\nGaelic games include Gaelic football, hurling (and camogie), handball and rounders. Of the four, football is the most popular in Northern Ireland.  Players play for local clubs with the best being selected for their county teams. The Ulster GAA is the branch of the Gaelic Athletic Association that is responsible for the nine counties of Ulster, which include the six of Northern Ireland.\n\nThese nine county teams participate in the Ulster Senior Football Championship, Ulster Senior Hurling Championship, All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship.\n\nRecent successes for Northern Ireland teams include Armagh's 2002 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship win and Tyrone's wins in 2003, 2005 and 2008.\n\nGolf\n\nPerhaps Northern Ireland's most notable successes in professional sport have come in golf. Northern Ireland has contributed more major champions in the modern era than any other European country, with three in the space of just 14 months from the U.S. Open in 2010 to The Open Championship in 2011. Notable golfers include Fred Daly (winner of The Open in 1947), Ryder Cup players Ronan Rafferty and David Feherty, leading European Tour professionals David Jones, Michael Hoey (a winner on Tour in 2011) and Gareth Maybin, as well as three recent major winners Graeme McDowell (winner of the U.S. Open in 2010, the first European to do so since 1970), Rory McIlroy (winner of four majors) and Darren Clarke (winner of The Open in 2011).   Northern Ireland has also contributed several players to the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, including Alan Dunbar and Paul Cutler who played on the victorious 2011 team in Scotland.\n\nThe Golfing Union of Ireland, the governing body for men's and boy's amateur golf throughout Ireland and the oldest golfing union in the world, was founded in Belfast in 1891. Northern Ireland's golf courses include the Royal Belfast Golf Club (the earliest, formed in 1881), Royal Portrush Golf Club, which is the only course outside Great Britain to have hosted The Open Championship, and Royal County Down Golf Club (Golf Digest magazine's top-rated course outside the United States).  \n\nSnooker\n\nNorthern Ireland has produced two world snooker champions; Alex Higgins, who won the title in 1972 and 1982, and Dennis Taylor, who won in 1985. The highest-ranked Northern Ireland professional on the world circuit presently is Mark Allen from Antrim. The sport is governed locally by the Northern Ireland Billiards and Snooker Association who run regular ranking tournaments and competitions.\n\nMotor sports\n\nAlthough Northern Ireland lacks an international automobile racecourse, two Northern Irish drivers have finished inside the top two of Formula One, with John Watson achieving the feat in 1982 and Eddie Irvine doing the same in 1999. The largest course and the only MSA-licensed track for UK-wide competition is Kirkistown. \n\nRugby league\n\nThe Ireland national rugby league team has participated in the Emerging Nations Tournament (1995), the Super League World Nines (1996), the World Cup (2000 and 2008), European Nations Cup (since 2003) and Victory Cup (2004).\n\nThe Ireland A rugby league team compete annually in the Amateur Four Nations competition (since 2002) and the St Patrick's Day Challenge (since 1995).\n\nEducation\n\nUnlike most areas of the United Kingdom, in the last year of primary school many children sit entrance examinations for grammar schools.\n\nIntegrated schools, which attempt to ensure a balance in enrolment between pupils of Protestant, Roman Catholic and other faiths (or none), are becoming increasingly popular, although Northern Ireland still has a primarily de facto religiously segregated education system. In the primary school sector, forty schools (8.9% of the total number) are integrated schools and thirty-two (7.2% of the total number) are Irish language-medium schools.\n\nThe two main universities in Northern Ireland are Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University.\n\nMedia and communications\n\nThe BBC has a division called BBC Northern Ireland with headquarters in Belfast. As well as broadcasting standard UK-wide programmes, BBC NI produces local content, including a news break-out called BBC Newsline. The ITV franchise in Northern Ireland is Ulster Television (UTV). The state-owned Channel 4 and the privately owned Channel 5 also broadcast in Northern Ireland and access is also available to satellite and cable services.   All Northern Ireland viewers must obtain a UK TV licence to watch live television transmissions.\n\nRTÉ, the national broadcaster of the Republic of Ireland, is available over the air to most parts of Northern Ireland via reception overspill  and via satellite and cable.  Since the digital TV switchover, RTÉ One,  RTÉ2 and the Irish-language channel TG4, are now available over the air on the UK's Freeview system from transmitters within Northern Ireland.  Although they are transmitted in standard definition, a Freeview HD box or television is required for reception.\n\nAs well as the standard UK-wide radio stations from the BBC, Northern Ireland is home to many local radio stations, such as Cool FM, CityBeat, and Q102.9. The BBC has two regional radio stations which broadcast in Northern Ireland, BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Radio Foyle.\n\nThe Belfast Telegraph is the leading newspaper, and UK and Irish national newspapers are also available. There is a range of local newspapers such as the News Letter and the Irish News. \n\nNorthern Ireland uses the same telecommunications and postal services as the rest of the United Kingdom at standard domestic rates and there are no mobile roaming charges between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.   People in Northern Ireland who live close to the border with the Republic of Ireland may inadvertently switch over to the Irish mobile networks, causing international roaming fees to be applied.  Calls from landlines in Northern Ireland to numbers in the Republic of Ireland are charged at the same rate as those to numbers in Great Britain, while landline numbers in Northern Ireland can similarly be called from the Republic of Ireland at domestic rates, using the 048 prefix.",
                "Derry ( ), officially Londonderry (), is the second-largest city in Northern Ireland  and the fourth-largest city on the island of Ireland.  The name Derry is an anglicisation of the Irish name Daire or Doire meaning \"oak grove\".   In 1613, the city was granted a Royal Charter by King James I and gained the \"London\" prefix to reflect the funding of its construction by the London guilds. While the city is more usually known colloquially as Derry,  Londonderry is also commonly used and remains the legal name.\n\nThe old walled city lies on the west bank of the River Foyle, which is spanned by two road bridges and one footbridge. The city now covers both banks (Cityside on the west and Waterside on the east). The population of the city was 83,652 at the 2001 Census, while the Derry Urban Area had a population of 90,736.  The district administered by Derry City and Strabane District Council contains both Londonderry Port and City of Derry Airport.\n\nDerry is close to the border with County Donegal, with which it has had a close link for many centuries. The person traditionally seen as the founder of the original Derry is Saint Colmcille, a holy man from Tír Chonaill, the old name for almost all of modern County Donegal, of which the west bank of the Foyle was a part before 1610. \n\nIn 2013, Derry was the inaugural UK City of Culture, having been awarded the title in 2010.  \n\nName\n\nAccording to the city's Royal Charter of 10 April 1662, the official name is \"Londonderry\". This was reaffirmed in a High Court decision in 2007 when Derry City Council sought guidance on the procedure for effecting a name change.   The council had changed its name from \"Londonderry City Council\" to \"Derry City Council\" in 1984;  the court case was seeking clarification as to whether this had also changed the name of the city. The decision of the court was that it had not but it was clarified that the correct procedure to do so was via a petition to the Privy Council.  Derry City Council since started this process and were involved in conducting an equality impact assessment report (EQIA).  Firstly it held an opinion poll of district residents in 2009, which reported that 75% of Catholics and 77% of Nationalists found the proposed change acceptable, compared to 6% of Protestants and 8% of Unionists.  Then the EQIA held two consultative forums, and solicited comments from the general public on whether or not the city should have its name changed to Derry. A total of 12,136 comments were received, of which 3,108 were broadly in favour of the proposal, and 9,028 opposed to it.  On 23 July 2015, the council voted in favour of a motion to change the official name of the city to Derry and to write to Mark H. Durkan, Northern Ireland Minister of the Environment, to ask how the change could be effected. \n\nDespite the official name, the city is more usually known as \"Derry\",  which is an anglicisation of the Irish Daire or Doire, and translates as \"oak-grove/oak-wood\". The name derives from the settlement's earliest references, Daire Calgaich (\"oak-grove of Calgach\").  The name was changed from Derry in 1613 during the Plantation of Ulster to reflect the establishment of the city by the London guilds.  \n\nThe name \"Derry\" is preferred by nationalists and it is broadly used throughout Northern Ireland's Catholic community, as well as that of the Republic of Ireland, whereas many unionists prefer \"Londonderry\";  however in everyday conversation Derry is used by most Protestant residents of the city.  Linguist Kevin McCafferty argues that \"It is not, strictly speaking, correct that Northern Ireland Catholics call it Derry, while Protestants use the Londonderry form, although this pattern has become more common locally since the mid-1980s, when the city council changed its name by dropping the prefix\". In McCafferty's survey of language use in the city, \"only very few interviewees—all Protestants—use the official form\".\n\nApart from the name of Derry City Council, the city is usually known as Londonderry in official use within the UK. In the Republic of Ireland, the city and county are almost always referred to as Derry, on maps, in the media and in conversation.  In April 2009, however, the Republic of Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheál Martin, announced that Irish passport holders who were born there could record either Derry or Londonderry as their place of birth.   Whereas official road signs in the Republic use the name Derry, those in Northern Ireland bear Londonderry (sometimes abbreviated to  \"L'Derry\"), although some of these have been defaced with the reference to London obscured.  Usage varies among local organisations, with both names being used. Examples are City of Derry Airport, City of Derry Rugby Club, Derry City FC and the Protestant Apprentice Boys of Derry, as opposed to Londonderry Port, Londonderry YMCA Rugby Club and Londonderry Chamber of Commerce.  Most companies within the city choose local area names such as Pennyburn, Rosemount or \"Foyle\" from the River Foyle to avoid alienating the other community. Londonderry railway station is often referred to as Waterside railway station within the city but is called Derry/Londonderry at other stations. The council changed the name of the local government district covering the city to Derry on 7 May 1984, consequently renaming itself Derry City Council.  This did not change the name of the city, although the city is coterminous with the district, and in law the city council is also the \"Corporation of Londonderry\" or, more formally, the \"Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of the City of Londonderry\".  The form \"Londonderry\" is used for the post town by the Royal Mail, however use of Derry will still ensure delivery.\n\nThe city is also nicknamed the Maiden City by virtue of the fact that its walls were never breached despite being besieged on three separate occasions in the 17th century, the most notable being the Siege of Derry of 1688-89.  It is also nicknamed Stroke City by local broadcaster, Gerry Anderson, due to the 'politically correct' use of the oblique notation Derry/Londonderry (which appellation has itself been used by BBC Television ). A recent addition to the landscape has been the erection of several large stone columns on main roads into the city welcoming drivers, euphemistically, to \"the walled city\".\n\nThe name Derry is very much in popular use throughout Ireland for the naming of places, and there are at least six towns bearing that name and at least a further 79 places. The word Derry often forms part of the place name, for example Derrybeg, Derryboy, Derrylea and Derrymore.\n\nThe names Derry and Londonderry are not limited to Ireland. There is a town called Derry situated right beside another town called Londonderry in New Hampshire in the United States. There are also Londonderrys in Yorkshire, England, in Vermont, United States, in Nova Scotia, Canada, and in northern and eastern Australia. Londonderry Island is situated off Tierra del Fuego in Chile.\n\nDerry is also a fictional town in Maine, United States, used in some Stephen King novels. \n\nCity walls\n\nDerry is the only remaining completely intact walled city in Ireland and one of the finest examples of a walled city in Europe.    The walls constitute the largest monument in State care in Northern Ireland and, as the last walled city to be built in Europe, stands as the most complete and spectacular. \n\nThe Walls were built in 1613–1619 by The Honourable The Irish Society as defences for early 17th century settlers from England and Scotland. The Walls, which are approximately 1 mi in circumference and which vary in height and width between 12 and, are completely intact and form a walkway around the inner city. They provide a unique promenade to view the layout of the original town which still preserves its Renaissance style street plan. The four original gates to the Walled City are Bishop's Gate, Ferryquay Gate, Butcher Gate and Shipquay Gate. Three further gates were added later, Magazine Gate, Castle Gate and New Gate, making seven gates in total. Historic buildings within the walls include the 1633 Gothic cathedral of St Columb, the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall and the courthouse.\n\nIt is one of the few cities in Europe that never saw its fortifications breached, withstanding several sieges including one in 1689 which lasted 105 days, hence the city's nickname, The Maiden City. \n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nDerry is one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in Ireland.\n\n The earliest historical references date to the 6th century when a monastery was founded there by St Columba or Colmcille, a famous saint from what is now County Donegal, but for thousands of years before that people had been living in the vicinity.\n\nBefore leaving Ireland to spread Christianity elsewhere, Colmcille founded a monastery at Derry (which was then called Doire Calgach), on the west bank of the Foyle. According to oral and documented history, the site was granted to Colmcille by a local king.  The monastery then remained in the hands of the federation of Columban churches who regarded Colmcille as their spiritual mentor. The year 546 is often referred to as the date that the original settlement was founded. However, it is now accepted by historians that this was an erroneous date assigned by medieval chroniclers. It is accepted that between the 6th century and the 11th century, Derry was known primarily as a monastic settlement.\n\nThe town became strategically more significant during the Tudor conquest of Ireland and came under frequent attack. During O'Doherty's Rebellion in 1608 it was attacked by Sir Cahir O'Doherty, Irish chieftain of Inishowen, who burnt much of the town and killed the governor George Paulet.  The soldier and statesman Sir Henry Docwra made vigorous efforts to develop the town, earning the reputation of being \" the founder of Derry\"; but he was accused of failing to prevent the O'Doherty attack, and returned to England.\n\nPlantation\n\nWhat became the City of Derry was part of the relatively new County Donegal up until 1610.  In that year, the west bank of the future city was transferred by the English Crown to The Honourable The Irish Society and was combined with County Coleraine, part of County Antrim and a large portion of County Tyrone to form County Londonderry. Planters organised by London livery companies through The Honourable The Irish Society arrived in the 17th century as part of the Plantation of Ulster, and rebuilt the town with high walls to defend it from Irish insurgents who opposed the plantation. The aim was to settle Ulster with a population supportive of the Crown. It was then renamed \"Londonderry\".\n\nThis city was the first planned city in Ireland: it was begun in 1613, with the walls being completed in 1619, at a cost of £10,757.  The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was thought to be a good design for defence. The grid pattern chosen was subsequently much copied in the colonies of British North America.  The charter initially defined the city as extending three Irish miles (about 6.1 km) from the centre.\n\nThe modern city preserves the 17th century layout of four main streets radiating from a central Diamond to four gateways  – Bishop's Gate, Ferryquay Gate, Shipquay Gate and Butcher's Gate. The city's oldest surviving building was also constructed at this time: the 1633 Plantation Gothic cathedral of St Columb. In the porch of the cathedral is a stone that records completion with the inscription: \"If stones could speake, then London's prayse should sound, Who built this church and cittie from the grounde.\" \n\n17th-century upheavals\n\nDuring the 1640s, the city suffered in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, which began with the Irish Rebellion of 1641, when the Gaelic Irish insurgents made a failed attack on the city. In 1649 the city and its garrison, which supported the republican Parliament in London, were besieged by Scottish Presbyterian forces loyal to King Charles I. The Parliamentarians besieged in Derry were relieved by a strange alliance of Roundhead troops under George Monck and the Irish Catholic general Owen Roe O'Neill. These temporary allies were soon fighting each other again however, after the landing in Ireland of the New Model Army in 1649. The war in Ulster was finally brought to an end when the Parliamentarians crushed the Irish Catholic Ulster army at the Battle of Scarrifholis, near Letterkenny in nearby County Donegal, in 1650.\n\nDuring the Glorious Revolution, only Derry and nearby Enniskillen had a Protestant garrison by November 1688. An army of around 1,200 men, mostly \"Redshanks\" (Highlanders), under Alexander Macdonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised (they set out on the week William of Orange landed in England). When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. In April 1689, King James came to the city and summoned it to surrender. The King was rebuffed and the siege lasted until the end of July with the arrival of a relief ship.\n\n18th and 19th centuries\n\nThe city was rebuilt in the 18th century with many of its fine Georgian style houses still surviving. The city's first bridge across the River Foyle was built in 1790. During the 18th and 19th centuries the port became an important embarkation point for Irish emigrants setting out for North America. Some of these founded the colonies of Derry and Londonderry in the state of New Hampshire.\n\nAlso during the 19th century, it became a destination for migrants fleeing areas more severely affected by the Irish Potato Famine.  One of the most notable shipping lines was the McCorkell Line operated by Wm. McCorkell & Co. Ltd. from 1778.  The McCorkell's most famous ship was the Minnehaha, which was known as the \"Green Yacht from Derry\".\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nWorld War I\n\nThe city contributed over 5,000 men to the British Army from Catholic and Protestant families.\n\nPartition\n\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the area was rocked by sectarian violence, partly prompted by the guerilla war raging between the Irish Republican Army and British forces, but also influenced by economic and social pressures. By mid-1920 there was severe sectarian rioting in the city.   Many lives were lost and in addition many Catholics and Protestants were expelled from their homes during this communal unrest. After a week's violence, a truce was negotiated by local politicians on both unionist and republican sides.\n\nIn 1921, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the Partition of Ireland, it unexpectedly became a 'border city', separated from much of its traditional economic hinterland in County Donegal.\n\nWorld War II\n\nDuring World War II, the city played an important part in the Battle of the Atlantic. \nShips from the Royal Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, and other Allied navies were stationed in the city and the United States military established a base. Over 20,000 Royal Navy, 10,000 Royal Canadian Navy, and 6,000 American Navy personnel were stationed in the city during the war. \nThe establishment of the American presence in the city was the result of a secret agreement between the Americans and the British before the Americans entered the war.  It was the first American naval base in Europe and the terminal for American convoys en route to Europe.\n\nThe reason for such a high degree of military and naval activity was self-evident: Derry was the United Kingdom's westernmost port; indeed, the city was the westernmost Allied port in Europe: thus, Derry was a crucial jumping-off point, together with Glasgow and Liverpool, for the shipping convoys that ran between Europe and North America. The large numbers of military personnel in Derry substantially altered the character of the city, bringing in some outside colour to the local area, as well as some cosmopolitan and economic buoyancy during these years. Several airfields were built in the outlying regions of the city at this time, Maydown, Eglinton and Ballykelly. RAF Eglinton went on to become City of Derry Airport.\n\nThe city contributed significant number of men to the war effort throughout the services, most notably the 500 men in the 9th (Londonderry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, known as the 'Derry Boys'. This regiment served in North Africa, the Sudan, Italy and mainland UK. Many others served in the Merchant Navy taking part in the convoys that supplied the UK and Russia during the war.\n\nThe border location of the city, and influx of trade from the military convoys allowed for significant smuggling operations to develop in the city.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Second World War, eventually some 60 U-boats of the German Kriegsmarine ended in the city's harbour at Lisahally after their surrender.  The initial surrender was attended by Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Approaches, and Sir Basil Brooke, third Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.\n\nLate 20th century\n\n1950s and 1960s\n\nThe city languished after the second world war, with unemployment and development stagnating. A large campaign, led by the University for Derry Committee, to have Northern Ireland's second university located in the city, ended in failure.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement\n\nDerry was a focal point for the nascent civil rights movement in Northern Ireland.\n\nCatholics were discriminated against under Unionist government in Northern Ireland, both politically and economically.    In the late 1960s the city became the flashpoint of disputes about institutional gerrymandering. Political scientist John Whyte explains that:\n\nAll the accusations of gerrymandering, practically all the complaints about housing and regional policy, and a disproportionate amount of the charges about public and private employment come from this area. The area – which consisted of Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh, Londonderry County Borough, and portions of Counties Londonderry and Armagh – had less than a quarter of the total population of Northern Ireland yet generated not far short of three-quarters of the complaints of discrimination...The unionist government must bear its share of responsibility. It put through the original gerrymander which underpinned so many of the subsequent malpractices, and then, despite repeated protests, did nothing to stop those malpractices continuing. The most serious charge against the Northern Ireland government is not that it was directly responsible for widespread discrimination, but that it allowed discrimination on such a scale over a substantial segment of Northern Ireland. \n\nA civil rights demonstration in 1968 led by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was banned by the Government and blocked using force by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The events that followed the August 1969 Apprentice Boys parade resulted in the Battle of the Bogside, when Catholic rioters fought the police, leading to widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and is often dated as the starting point of the Troubles.\n\nOn Sunday 30 January 1972, 13 unarmed civilians were shot dead by British paratroopers during a civil rights march in the Bogside area. Another 13 were wounded and one further man later died of his wounds. This event came to be known as Bloody Sunday.\n\nThe Troubles\n\nThe conflict which became known as the Troubles is widely regarded as having started in Derry with the Battle of the Bogside. The Civil Rights movement had also been very active in the city. In the early 1970s the city was heavily militarised and there was widespread civil unrest. Several districts in the city constructed barricades to control access and prevent the forces of the state from entering.\n\nViolence eased towards the end of the Troubles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Irish journalist Ed Maloney claims in \"The Secret History of the IRA\" that republican leaders there negotiated a de facto ceasefire in the city as early as 1991. Whether this is true or not, the city did see less bloodshed by this time than Belfast or other localities.\n\nThe city was visited by a killer whale in November 1977 at the height of the Troubles; it was dubbed Dopey Dick by the thousands who came from miles around to see him.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe local district council is Derry City Council, which consists of five electoral areas: Cityside, Northland, Rural, Shantallow and Waterside. The council of 30 members is re-elected every four years. As of the 2011 election, 14 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) members, ten Sinn Féin, five Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), and one Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) make up the council. The mayor and deputy mayor are elected annually by councillors.\n\nThe local authority boundaries correspond to the Foyle constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Foyle constituency of the Northern Ireland Assembly. In European Parliament elections, it is part of the Northern Ireland constituency.\n\nCoat of arms and motto\n\nThe devices on the city's arms are a skeleton and a three-towered castle on a black field, with the chief or top third of the shield depicting the arms of the City of London: a red cross and sword on white. In the centre of the cross is a gold harp.\nThe blazon of the arms is as follows:\n\nSable, a human skeleton Or seated upon a mossy stone proper and in dexter chief a castle triple towered argent on a chief also argent a cross gules thereon a harp or and in the first quarter a sword erect gules \n\nAccording to documents in the College of Arms in London and the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland in Dublin, the arms of the city were confirmed in 1613 by Daniel Molyneux, Ulster King of Arms. The College of Arms document states that the original arms of the City of Derry were ye picture of death (or a skeleton) on a moissy stone & in ye dexter point a castle and that upon grant of a charter of incorporation and the renaming of the city as Londonderry in that year the first mayor had requested the addition of a \"chief of London\".  \n\nTheories have been advanced as to the meaning of the \"old\" arms of Derry, before the addition of the chief bearing the arms of the City of London:\n* A suggestion has been made that the castle is related to an early 14th-century castle in nearby Greencastle belonging to the Anglo-Norman Earl of Ulster Richard de Burgh.\n* The most popular theory about the skeleton is that it is that of a Norman De Burgh knight who was starved to death in the castle dungeons in 1332 on the orders of his cousin the above-mentioned Earl of Ulster. Another explanation put forward was that it depicted Cahir O'Doherty (Sir Charles O'Dogherty), who was put to death after Derry was invested by the English army in 1608. During the days of Gerrymandering and discrimination against the Catholic population of Derry, Derry's Roman Catholics often used to claim in dark wit that the skeleton was a local waiting for help from the council bureaucracy.\n\nIn 1979, Londonderry City Council, as it was then known, commissioned a report into the city's arms and insignia, as part of the design process for an heraldic badge. The published report found that there was no basis for any of the popular explanations for the skeleton and that it was \"purely symbolic and does not refer to any identifiable person\". \n\nThe 1613 records of the arms depicted a harp in the centre of the cross, but this was omitted from later depictions of the city arms, and in the Letters Patent confirming the arms to Londonderry Corporation in 1952.  In 2002 Derry City Council applied to the College of Arms to have the harp restored to the city arms, and Garter and Norroy & Ulster Kings of Arms accepted the 17th century evidence, issuing letters patent to that effect in 2003.\n\nThe motto attached to the coat of arms reads in Latin, \"Vita, Veritas, Victoria\". This translates into English as, \"Life, Truth, Victory\".\n\nThe councillors elected in 2014 for the city are:\n\nGeography\n\nDerry is characterised by its distinctively hilly topography.  The River Foyle forms a deep valley as it flows through the city, making Derry a place of very steep streets and sudden, startling views. The original walled city of Londonderry lies on a hill on the west bank of the River Foyle. In the past, the river branched and enclosed this wooded hill as an island; over the centuries, however, the western branch of the river dried up and became a low-lying and boggy district that is now called the Bogside. \n\nToday, modern Derry extends considerably north and west of the city walls and east of the river. The half of the city the west of the Foyle is known as the Cityside and the area east is called the Waterside. The Cityside and Waterside are connected by the Craigavon Bridge and Foyle Bridge, and by a foot bridge in the centre of the city called Peace Bridge. The district also extends into rural areas to the southeast of the city.\n\nThis much larger city, however, remains characterised by the often extremely steep hills that form much of its terrain on both sides of the river. A notable exception to this lies on the north-eastern edge of the city, on the shores of Lough Foyle, where large expanses of sea and mudflats were reclaimed in the middle of the 19th century. Today, these slob lands are protected from the sea by miles of sea walls and dikes. The area is an internationally important bird sanctuary, ranked among the top 30 wetland sites in the UK. \n\nOther important nature reserves lie at Ness Country Park,  10 mi east of Derry; and at Prehen Wood,  within the city's south-eastern suburbs.\n\nClimate\n\nDerry has, like most of Ireland, a temperate maritime climate  according to the Köppen climate classification system. The nearest official Met Office Weather Station for which climate data is available is Carmoney,  just west of City of Derry Airport and about 5 mi north east of the city centre. However, observations ceased in 2004 and the nearest Weather Station is currently Ballykelly, due 12 mi east north east.  Typically, 27 nights of the year will report an air frost at Ballykelly, and at least 1 mm of precipitation will be reported on 170 days (1981–2010 averages).\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded at Carmoney was  on 27 December 1995. \n\nDemography\n\nDerry Urban Area (DUA), including the city and the neighbouring settlements of Culmore, Newbuildings and Strathfoyle, is classified as a city by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) since its population exceeds 75,000. On census day (27 March 2011) there were 105,066 people living in Derry Urban Area. Of these, 27% were aged under 16 years and 14% were aged 60 and over; 49% of the population were male and 51% were female; 75% were from a Roman Catholic background and 23% (up three per cent from 2001) were from a Protestant background.\n\nThe mid-2006 population estimate for the wider Derry City Council area was 107,300. Population growth in 2005/06 was driven by natural change, with net out-migration of approximately 100 people.\n\nThe city was one of the few in Ireland to experience an increase in population during the Irish Potato Famine as migrants came to it from other, more heavily affected areas.\n\nProtestant minority\n\nConcerns have been raised by both communities over the increasingly divided nature of the city. There were about 17,000 Protestants on the west bank of the River Foyle in 1971.  The proportion rapidly declined during the 1970s;  the 2011 census recorded 3,169 Protestants on the west bank, compared to 54,976 Catholics,  and it is feared that the city could become permanently divided.  \n\nHowever, concerted efforts have been made by local community, church and political leaders from both traditions to redress the problem. A conference to bring together key actors and promote tolerance was held in October 2006.  The Rt Rev. Dr Ken Good, the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, said he was happy living on the cityside. \"I feel part of it. It is my city and I want to encourage other Protestants to feel exactly the same\", he said.\n\nSupport for Protestants in the district has been strong from the former SDLP city Mayor Helen Quigley. Cllr Quigley has made inclusion and tolerance key themes of her mayoralty. The Mayor Helen Quigley said it is time for \"everyone to take a stand to stop the scourge of sectarian and other assaults in the city.\" \n\nEconomy\n\nHistory\n\nThe economy of the district was based significantly on the textile industry until relatively recently. For many years women were often the sole wage earners working in the shirt factories while the men predominantly in comparison had high levels of unemployment.  This led to significant male emigration. The history of shirt making in the city dates back as far as 1831 and is said to have been started by William Scott and his family who first exported shirts to Glasgow.  Within 50 years, shirt making in the city was the most prolific in the UK with garments being exported all over the world. It was known so well that the industry received a mention in Das Kapital by Karl Marx, when discussing the factory system:\n\nThe industry reached its peak in the 1920s employing around 18,000 people. In modern times however the textile industry declined due to in most part cheaper Asian wages. \n\nA long-term foreign employer in the area is Du Pont, which has been based at Maydown since 1958, its first European production facility. Originally Neoprene was manufactured at Maydown and subsequently followed by Hypalon. More recently Lycra and Kevlar production units were active.  Thanks to a healthy worldwide demand for Kevlar which is made at the plant, the facility recently undertook a £40 million upgrade to expand its global Kevlar production. Du Pont has stated that contributing factors to its continued commitment to Maydown are \"low labour costs, excellent communications, and tariff-free, easy access to the Britain and European continent.\"\n\nInward investment\n\nIn the last 15 years there has been a drive to increase inward investment in the city, more recently concentrating on digital industries. Currently the three largest private-sector employers are American firms. Economic successes have included call centres and a large investment by Seagate, which has operated a factory in the Springtown Industrial Estate since 1993. Seagate currently employs over 1,000 people, producing more than half of the company's total requirement for hard drive read-write heads.\n\nA controversial new employer in the area was Raytheon Systems Limited, a software division of the American defence contractor, which was set up in Derry in 1999.  Although some of the local people welcomed the jobs boost, others in the area objected to the jobs being provided by a firm involved heavily in the arms trade.  Following four years of protest by the Foyle Ethical Investment Campaign, in 2004 Derry City Council passed a motion declaring the district a \"A 'No – Go' Area for the Arms Trade\",  and in 2006 its offices were briefly occupied by anti-war protestors who became known as the Raytheon 9.  In 2009, the company announced that it was not renewing its lease when it expired in 2010 and was looking for a new location for its operations. \n\nSignificant multinational employers in the region include Firstsource of India, DuPont, INVISTA, Stream International, Seagate Technology, Perfecseal, NTL, Raytheon and Northbrook Technology of the United States, Arntz Belting and Invision Software of Germany, and Homeloan Management of the UK. Major local business employers include Desmonds, Northern Ireland's largest privately owned company, manufacturing and sourcing garments, E&I Engineering, St. Brendan's Irish Cream Liqueur and McCambridge Duffy, one of the largest insolvency practices in the UK. \n\nEven though the city provides cheap labour by standards in Western Europe, critics have noted that the grants offered by the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board have helped land jobs for the area that only last as long as the funding lasts.  This was reflected in questions to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Richard Needham, in 1990.  It was noted that it cost £30,000 to create one job in an American firm in Northern Ireland.\n\nCritics of investment decisions affecting the district often point to the decision to build a new university building in nearby (predominantly Protestant) Coleraine rather than developing the Ulster UniversityMagee Campus. Another major government decision affecting the city was the decision to create the new town of Craigavon outside Belfast, which again was detrimental to the development of the city. Even in October 2005, there was perceived bias against the comparatively impoverished North West of the province, with a major civil service job contract going to Belfast. Mark Durkan, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader and Member of Parliament (MP) for Foyle was quoted in the Belfast Telegraph as saying:\n\nIn July 2005, the Irish Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen, called for a joint task force to drive economic growth in the cross border region. This would have implications for Counties Londonderry, Tyrone, and Donegal across the border.\n\nShopping\n\nThe city is the north west's foremost shopping district, housing two large shopping centres along with numerous shop packed streets serving much of the greater county, as well as Tyrone and Donegal. While retail developments in Letterkenny have lessened cross-border traffic from north County Donegal, the weakness of the pound sterling over the course of 2009 made border towns such as Derry attractive to shoppers from south of the border.  \n\nThe city centre has two main shopping centres; the Foyleside Shopping Centre which has 45 stores and 1430 parking spaces, and the Richmond Centre, which has 39 retail units. The Quayside Shopping Centre also serves the city-side and there is also Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre in the Waterside. These centres, as well as local-run businesses, feature numerous national and international stores. A recent addition was the Crescent Link Retail Park located in the Waterside with many international chain stores, including Homebase, Currys & PC World (stores combined), Carpet Right, Maplin, Argos Extra, Toys R Us, Halfords, DW Sports (formerly JJB Sports), Pets at Home, Next Home, Starbucks, McDonalds, Tesco Express and M&S Simply Food. In the short period of time that this site has been operational, it has quickly grown to become the second largest retail park in Northern Ireland (second only to Sprucefield in Lisburn).  Plans have also been approved for Derry's first Asda store, which will be located at the retail park sharing a unit with Homebase.  Sainsbury's also applied for planning permission for a store at Crescent Link, but Environment Minister Alex Attwood turned it down. \n\nThe city is also home to the world's oldest independent department store; Austins. Established in 1830, Austins predates Jenners of Edinburgh by 5 years, Harrods of London by 15 years and Macy's of New York by 25 years.  The store's five-story Edwardian building is located within the walled city in the area known as The Diamond.\n\nLandmarks\n\nDerry is renowned for its architecture. This can be primarily ascribed to the formal planning of the historic walled city of Derry at the core of the modern city. This is centred on the Diamond with a collection of late Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian buildings maintaining the gridlines of the main thoroughfares (Shipquay Street, Ferryquay Street, Butcher Street and Bishop Street) to the City Gates. St Columb's Cathedral does not follow the grid pattern reinforcing its civic status. This Church of Ireland Cathedral was the first post-Reformation Cathedral built for an Anglican church. The construction of the Roman Catholic St Eugene's Cathedral in the Bogside in the 19th-century was another major architectural addition to the city. The more recent infill buildings within the walls are of varying quality and in many cases these were low quality hurriedly constructed replacements for 1970s bomb damaged buildings. The Townscape Heritage Initiative has funded restoration works to key listed buildings and other older structures.\n\nIn the three centuries since their construction, the city walls have been adapted to meet the needs of a changing city. The best example of this adaptation is the insertion of three additional gates – Castle Gate, New Gate and Magazine Gate – into the walls in the course of the 19th century. Today, the fortifications form a continuous promenade around the city centre, complete with cannon, avenues of mature trees and views across Derry. Historic buildings within the city walls include St Augustine's Church, which sits on the city walls close to the site of the original monastic settlement; the copper-domed Austin's department store, which claims to the oldest such store in the world; and the imposing Greek Revival Courthouse on Bishop Street. The red-brick late-Victorian Guildhall, also crowned by a copper dome, stands just beyond Shipquay Gate and close to the river front.\n\nThere are many museums and sites of interest in and around the city, including the Foyle Valley Railway Centre, the Amelia Earhart Centre And Wildlife Sanctuary, the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall, Ballyoan Cemetery, The Bogside, numerous murals by the Bogside Artists, Derry Craft Village, Free Derry Corner, O'Doherty Tower (now home to part of the Tower Museum), the Guildhall, the Harbour Museum, the Museum of Free Derry, Chapter House Museum, the Workhouse Museum, the Nerve Centre, St. Columb's Park and Leisure Centre, St Eugene's Cathedral, Creggan Country Park, The Millennium Forum and the Foyle and Craigavon bridges.\n\nThe city has seen a large boost to its economy in the form of tourism over the last few years. Cheap flights offered by budget airlines have enticed many people to visit the city. Tourism mainly focuses around the pubs, mainly those of Waterloo Street. Other attractions include museums, a vibrant shopping centre and trips to the Giant's Causeway, which is approximately 50 mi away, though poorly connected by public transport. Lonely Planet called Londonderry the fourth best city in the world to see in 2013. \n\nFuture projects include the Walled City Signature Project, which intends to ensure that the city's walls become a world class tourist experience.  The Ilex Urban Regeneration Company is charged with delivering several landmark redevelopments. It has taken control of two former British Army barracks in the centre of the city. The Ebrington site is nearing completion and is linked to the city centre by the new Peace Bridge.\n\nTransport\n\nThe transport network is built out of a complex array of old and modern roads and railways throughout the city and county. The city's road network also makes use of two bridges to cross the River Foyle, the Craigavon Bridge and the Foyle Bridge, the longest bridge in Ireland. Derry also serves as a major transport hub for travel throughout nearby County Donegal.\n\nIn spite of it being the second city of Northern Ireland (and it being the second-largest city in all of Ulster), road and rail links to other cities are below par for its standing. Many business leaders claim that government investment in the city and infrastructure has been badly lacking. Some have stated that this is due to its outlying border location whilst others have cited a sectarian bias against the region west of the River Bann due to its high proportion of Catholics.   There is no direct motorway link with Dublin or Belfast. The rail link to Belfast has been downgraded over the years so that presently it is not a viable alternative to the roads for industry to rely on. There are currently plans for £1 billion worth of transport infrastructure investment in and around the district. Planned upgrades to the A5 Dublin road agreed as part of the Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrews Talks fell through when the government of the Republic of Ireland reneged on its funding citing the recent economic crisis.\n\nBuses\n\nMost public transport in Northern Ireland is operated by the subsidiaries of Translink. Originally the city's internal bus network was run by Ulsterbus, which still provides the city's connections with other towns in Northern Ireland. The city's buses are now run by Ulsterbus Foyle, just as Translink Metro now provides the bus service in Belfast. The Ulsterbus Foyle network offers 13 routes across the city into the suburban areas, excluding an Easibus link which connects to the Waterside and Drumahoe, and a free Rail Link Bus runs from the Waterside Railway Station to the city centre. All buses leave from the Foyle Street Bus Station in the city centre.\n\nLong distance buses depart from Foyle Street Bus Station to destinations throughout Ireland. Buses are operated by both Ulsterbus and Bus Éireann on cross-border routes. Lough Swilly formerly operated buses to Co. Donegal, but the company entered liquidation and is no longer in operation. There is a half-hourly service to Belfast every day, called the Maiden City Flyer, which is the Goldline Express flagship route. There are hourly services to Strabane, Omagh, Coleraine, Letterkenny and Buncrana, and up to twelve services a day to bring people to Dublin. There is a daily service to Sligo, Galway, Shannon Airport and Limerick.\n\nAir\n\nCity of Derry Airport, the council-owned airport near Eglinton, has been growing in recent years with new investment in extending the runway and plans to redevelop the terminal.  It is hoped that the new investment will add to the airport's currently limited array of domestic and international flights and reduce the annual subsidy of £3.5 million from the local council.\n\nThe A2 from Maydown to Eglinton, serving airport, has recently been turned into a dual carriageway.  City of Derry airport is the main regional airport for County Donegal, County Londonderry and west County Tyrone as well as Derry City itself.\n\nThe airport is served by Ryanair with scheduled flights to Birmingham International Airport, Glasgow Airport, Liverpool,  and London Stansted all year round with a summer schedule to Alicante and Faro.\n\nRailways\n\nNorthern Ireland Railways (N.I.R.) has a single route from Londonderry railway station (also known as Waterside Station) on the Waterside to Belfast Great Victoria Street via , , , , Mossley West and Belfast Central. The service, which had been allowed to deteriorate in the 1990s, has since been improved by increased investment.\n\nIn 2008 the Department for Regional Development announced plans to have the track re-laid between Derry and Coleraine by 2013, add a passing loop to increase traffic capacity and increase the number of trains by introducing two additional diesel multiple units. The £86 million plan will reduce the journey time to Belfast by 30 minutes and allow commuter trains to arrive before 9 a.m. for the first time. Many still do not use the train, because, at over two hours, it is slower centre-to-centre than the 100-minute Ulsterbus Goldline Express service. \n\nRailway history\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century the city was served by four different railways that between them linked the city with much of the province of Ulster, plus a harbour railway network that linked the other four lines. There was also a tramway on the City side of the Foyle.\n\n19th and 20th century growth\n\nDerry's first railway was the Irish gauge () Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway (L&ER). Construction began in 1845 from a temporary station at  Cow Market on the City side of the Foyle, reached Strabane in 1847 and was extended from Cow Market to its permanent terminus at Foyle Road in 1850.Hajducki, op. cit., inset to map 2 The L&ER reached Omagh in 1852 and Enniskillen in 1854, and was absorbed into the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) in 1883. \n\nThe Londonderry and Coleraine Railway (L&CR), also Irish gauge, reached the city in 1852 and opened its terminus at Waterside. The Belfast and Northern Counties Railway leased the line from 1861 and took it over in 1871.\n\nThe Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway opened between Farland Point on Lough Swilly and a temporary terminus at Pennyburn in 1863. In 1866 it extended from Pennyburn to its permanent terminus at Graving Dock. The L&LSR was Irish gauge until 1885, when it was converted to  narrow gauge for through running with the Letterkenny Railway.\n\nThe Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners (LPHC) linked Graving Dock and Foyle Road stations with a railway through Middle Quay in 1867, and linked this line with Waterside station by a railway over the new Carlisle Bridge in 1868. The bridge was replaced in 1933 with the double-deck Craigavon Bridge, with the LPHC railway on its lower deck.\n\nIn 1900 the  gauge Donegal Railway extended from Strabane to Derry, establishing a terminus at Victoria Road. This was next to Carlisle Bridge and had a junction with the LPHC railway. The LPHC line was altered to dual gauge which allowed  gauge traffic between the Donegal Railway and L&LSR as well as Irish gauge traffic between the GNR and B&NCR. In 1906 the Northern Counties Committee (NCC, successor to the B&NCR) and the GNR jointly took over the Donegal Railway, making it the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDRJC).\n\nThe United Kingdom Government subsidised both the L&LSR and the Donegal Railway to build long extensions into remote parts of County Donegal. By 1905 these served much of the county,  making Derry (and also Strabane) a key rail hub for the county.\n\nThe City of Derry Tramways was opened in 1897.Hajducki, op. cit., page xvii This was a standard gauge () line served by horse trams and was never electrified. The tramway had only one line, was  long, and ran along the City side of the Foyle parallel to the LPHC's line on that side of the river.  It was closed in 1919.\n\n20th century decline\n\nThe partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Donegal into an international frontier. This changed trade patterns to the railways' detriment and placed border posts on every line to and from Derry except the NCC route to . The L&LSR crossed the border between Pennyburn and Bridge End, the CDRJC crossed just beyond Strabane, and the GNR line crossed twice between Derry and Strabane. Stops for customs inspections greatly delayed trains and disrupted timekeeping.\n\nOver the next few years customs agreements between the two states enabled GNR trains to and from Derry to pass through the Free State without inspection unless they were scheduled to serve local stations on the west bank of the Foyle, and for goods on all railways to be carried between different parts of the Free State to pass through Northern Ireland under customs bond. However, local passenger and goods traffic continued to be delayed by customs examinations.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s and again after the Second World War the railways also faced increasing road competition. The L&LSR closed its line in 1953, followed by the CDRJC in 1954.Hajducki, op. cit., map 39 The Ulster Transport Authority took over the NCC in 1949 and the GNR's lines in Northern Ireland in 1958. The UTA also took over the LPHC railway, which it closed in 1962. In accordance with The Benson Report submitted to the Northern Ireland Government in 1963, the UTA closed the former GNR line to Derry in 1965. \n\nSince 1965 the former L&CR line has been Derry's sole railway link. As such it has carried not only passenger services between Derry and Belfast but also CIÉ freight services using Derry as a railhead for Donegal.\n\nRoad network\n\nThe road network has historically seen under-investment and has lacked good road connections to both Belfast and Dublin for many years. Long overdue, the largest road investment in the north west's history is now (2010) taking place with building of the 'A2 Broadbridge Maydown to City of Derry Airport dualling' project  and announcement of the 'A6 Londonderry to Dungiven Dualling Scheme'  which will help to reduce the travel time to Belfast.  The latter project brings a dual-carriageway link between Northern Ireland's two largest cities one step closer. The project is costing £320 million and is expected to be completed in 2016.\n\nIn October 2006 the Government of Ireland announced that it was to invest €1 billion in Northern Ireland;  and one of the planned projects will be 'The A5 Western Transport Corridor',  the complete upgrade of the A5 Derry – Omagh – Aughnacloy (– Dublin) road, around 90 km long, to dual carriageway standard. \n\nIt is not yet known if these two separate projects will connect at any point, although there have been calls for some form of connection between the two routes. In June 2008 Conor Murphy, Minister for Regional Development, announced that there will be a study into the feasibility of connecting the A5 and A6. Should it proceed, the scheme would most likely run from Drumahoe to south of Prehen along the south east of the City.\n\nSea\n\nLondonderry Port at Lisahally is the United Kingdom's most westerly port and has capacity for 30,000-ton vessels. The Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners (LPHC) announced record turnover, record profits and record tonnage figures for the year ended March 2008. The figures are the result of a significant capital expenditure programme for the period 2000 to 2007 of about £22 million. Tonnage handled by LPHC increased almost 65% between 2000 and 2007, according to the latest annual results.\n\nThe port gave vital Allied service in the longest running campaign of the Second World War, the Battle of the Atlantic, and saw the surrender of the German U-Boat fleet at Lisahally on 8 May 1945. \n\nInland waterways\n\nThe tidal River Foyle is navigable from the coast at Derry to approximately 10 mi inland. In 1796, the Strabane Canal was opened, continuing the navigation a further 4 mi southwards to Strabane. The canal was closed in 1962.\n\nEducation\n\nDerry is home to the Magee Campus of Ulster University, formerly Magee College. However, Lockwood's  1960s decision to locate Northern Ireland's second university in Coleraine rather than Derry helped contribute to the formation of the civil rights movement that ultimately led to The Troubles. Derry was the town more closely associated with higher learning, with Magee College already more than a century old by that time.   In the mid-1980s a half-hearted attempt was made at rectifying this mistake by forming Magee College as a campus of the Ulster University but this has failed to stifle calls for the establishment of an independent University in Derry that can grow to it full potential.  The campus has never thrived and currently only has 3,500 students out of a total Ulster University student population of 27,000. Ironically, although Coleraine is blamed by many in the city for 'stealing the University', it has only 5,000 students, the remaining 19,000 being based in Belfast. \n\nThe North West Regional College is also based in the city. In recent years it has grown to almost 30,000 students. \n\nOne of the two oldest secondary schools in Northern Ireland is located in Derry, Foyle and Londonderry College. It was founded in 1616 by the merchant taylors and remains a popular choice. Other secondary schools include St. Columb's College, Oakgrove Integrated College, St Cecilia's College, St Mary's College, St. Joseph's Boys' School, Lisneal College, Thornhill College, Lumen Christi College and St. Brigid's College. There are also numerous primary schools.\n\nSports\n\nThe city is home to sports clubs and teams. Both association football and Gaelic football are popular in the area.\n\nAssociation football\n\nIn association football, the city's most prominent clubs include Derry City who play in the national league of the Republic of Ireland; Institute of the NIFL Championship and Oxford United Stars and Trojans, both of the Northern Ireland Intermediate League.\nIn addition to these clubs, who all play in national leagues, other clubs are based in the city. The local football league governed by the IFA is the North-West Junior League, which contains many clubs from the city, such as BBOB (Boys Brigade Old Boys) and Lincoln Courts. The city's other  junior league is the Derry and District League and teams from the city and surrounding areas participate, including Don Boscos and Creggan Swifts. The Foyle Cup youth soccer tournament is held annually in the city. It has attracted many notable teams in the past, including Werder Bremen, IFK Göteborg and Ferencváros.\n\nGaelic football\n\nIn Gaelic football Derry GAA are the county team and play in the Gaelic Athletic Association's National Football League, Ulster Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. They also field hurling teams in the equivalent tournaments. There are many Gaelic games clubs in and around the city, for example Na Magha CLG, Steelstown GAC, Doire Colmcille CLG, Seán Dolans GAC, Na Piarsaigh CLG Doire Trasna and Slaughtmanus GAC.\n\nBoxing\n\nThere are many boxing clubs, the most well-known being The Ring Boxing Club, which is associated with Charlie Nash  and John Duddy,  amongst others.\n\nRugby Union\n\nRugby Union is also quite popular in the city, with the City of Derry Rugby Club situated not far from the city centre.  City of Derry won both the Ulster Towns Cup and the Ulster Junior Cup in 2009.\nLondonderry YMCA RFC is another rugby club and is based in Drumahoe which is just outside the city.\n\nBasketball\n\nThe city's only basketball club is North Star Basketball Club which has teams in the Basketball Northern Ireland senior and junior Leagues. \n\nCricket\n\nCricket is also a popular sport in the city, particularly in the Waterside. The city is home to two cricket clubs, Brigade Cricket Club and Glendermott Cricket Club, both of whom play in the North West Senior League.\n\nGolf\n\nGolf is also a sport which is popular with many in the City. There are two golf clubs situated in the city, City of Derry Golf Club and Foyle International Golf Centre.\n\nCulture\n\nIn recent years the city and surrounding countryside have become well known for their artistic legacy, producing Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney,  poet Seamus Deane, playwright Brian Friel,  writer and music critic Nik Cohn, artist Willie Doherty, socio-political commentator and activist Eamonn McCann  and bands such as The Undertones. The large political gable-wall murals of Bogside Artists, Free Derry Corner, the Foyle Film Festival, the Derry Walls, St Eugene's and St Columb's Cathedrals and the annual Halloween street carnival  are popular tourist attractions. In 2010, Derry was named the UK's tenth 'most musical' city by PRS for Music. \n\nIn May 2013 a perpetual Peace Flame Monument was unveiled by Martin Luther King III and Presbyterian minister Rev. David Latimer. The flame was lit by children from both traditions in the city and is one of only 15 such flames across the world.  \n\nMedia\n\nThe local papers the Derry Journal (known as the Londonderry Journal until 1880) and the Londonderry Sentinel reflect the divided history of the city: the Journal was founded in 1772 and is Ireland's second oldest newspaper; the Sentinel newspaper was formed in 1829 when new owners of the Journal embraced Catholic Emancipation, and the editor left the paper to set up the Sentinel. There are numerous radio stations receivable: the largest stations based in the city are BBC Radio Foyle  and the commercial station Q102.9.  There was a locally based television station, C9TV, one of only two local or 'restricted' television services in Northern Ireland, which ceased broadcasts in 2007.\n\nNight-life\n\nThe city's night-life is mainly focused on the weekends, with several bars and clubs providing \"student nights\" during the weekdays. Waterloo Street and Strand Road provide the main venues. Waterloo Street, a steep street lined with both Irish traditional and modern pubs, frequently has live rock and traditional music at night. The city is renowned for producing talented musicians and many bands perform in venues around the city, for example the Smalltown America duo, Fighting with Wire and Jetplane Landing. Numerous other young local and indeed international bands perform at the Nerve Centre.\n\nEvents\n\n* In 2013, Derry became the first city to be designated UK City of Culture, having been awarded the title in July 2010.\n* Also in 2013 the city hosted Radio 1's Big Weekend  and the Lumiere festival. \n* The \"Banks of the Foyle Hallowe'en Carnival\" (known in Irish as Féile na Samhna) in Derry are a huge tourism boost for the city. The carnival is promoted as being the first and longest running Halloween carnival in the whole of Ireland,   It is called the largest street party in Ireland by the Derry Visitor and Convention Bureau with more than 30,000 ghoulish revellers taking to the streets annually. \n* In March, the city hosts the Big Tickle Comedy Festival, which in 2006 featured Dara Ó Briain and Colin Murphy. In April the city plays host to the City of Derry Jazz and Big Band Festival and in November the Foyle Film Festival, the biggest film festival in Northern Ireland.\n* Every summer the city hosts Tomo-Dachi, Ireland's largest Anime convention, which in July 2006 was held at Magee College, Ulster University. \n* The Siege of Derry is commemorated annually by the fraternal organisation the Apprentice Boys of Derry in the week-long Maiden City Festival.\n* The Instinct Festival is an annual youth festival celebrating the Arts. It is held around Easter and has proven a success in recent years.\n* Celtronic is a major annual electronic dance festival held at venues all around the city. The 2007 Festival featured the DJ, Erol Alkan.\n* The Millennium Forum is the main theatre in the city, it holds numerous shows weekly.\n* On 9 December 2007 Derry entered the Guinness Book of Records when 13,000 Santas gathered to break the world record beating previous records held by Liverpool and Las Vegas. \n* Winner of the 2005 Britain in Bloom competition (City category). Runner-up 2009.\n\nReferences in popular music\n\nNotable people\n\nNotable people who were born or have lived in Derry include:\n\n* Frederick Hervey, Bishop of Derry and 4th Earl of Bristol\n*Edward Leach, recipient of the Victoria Cross\n* The Restoration dramatist George Farquhar\n* Authors Joyce Cary, Seamus Deane, Jennifer Johnston and Nell McCafferty\n* Poet and Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney\n* Social Democratic and Labour Party founder and Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume\n* Scientist and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner William C.

                "Food & Wine | Perillo Tours\nSouth\nNortheast\nMany specialties in this part of Italy are dominated by fish from the Venetian Lagoon near Venice and from the Lake Garda, especially near the coasts. In the Mainland, we find more dishes with meat and cheeses. Seasonal vegetables like peas, courgettes, asparagus and the famous radicchio from Treviso are popular, and pasta, of course, is eaten everywhere. Also typical are polenta, made from maize flour, and risotto.\nSome typical dishes:\nRadicchio alla Griglia – Slightly bitter red endive, grilled over a hot fire.\nRisi e Bisi – Risotto made with rice, fresh peas and bacon.\nPolenta – Made from maize, it is served with tomato sauce, pork meat and sausages.\nFegato alla Veneziana – Traditional Venetian speciality of calf's liver cooked with sauteed onions.\nSarde in Saor – Other traditional Venetian dish, made with grilled fresh sardines, covered with sweet and sour sauce.\nTiramisu – Famous world wide, this dessert is made with ladyfingers, coffee and mascarpone cheese.\nWines: Veneto is a big producer of wines, red, white, rosé and prosecco, its own sparkling wine, often served as an aperitivo. The best white of the Northeast, however, are the ones from Friuli, like Collio Pinot Bianco, to name but one. Lovely red wines come from the Bardolino and Valpolicella area.\nNorthwest\nUnlike the rest of the country, butter is a basic ingredient here, used even more than olive oil. Risotto often appears on local menus, as does pasta, a wide choice of cheeses and the tasty and very rare truffles, typical of the Piedmont region.\nSome typical dishes:\nBagna Cauda – Anchovy and garlic based dip, sometimes flavored with truffles. It is served hot with fresh raw vegetables. This is one of Piedmont's most famous dishes.\nRisotto alla Milanese – Creamy risotto cooked with white wine, onions and saffron, topped with grated parmesan cheese.\nTrenette al Pesto – Genoese speciality, consists of egg noodles, served with a basil and pine nut tapenade.\nBresaola – thin slices of cured raw beef, served with fresh lemon juice and a little olive oil.\nCostolette alla Milanese – Veal cutlets dipped in egg and covered in bread crumbs, fried in butter.\nOssobuco – Shin of veal with marrow bone stewed in a rich tomato sauce seasoned with garlic and lemon rinds.\nManzo al Barolo – Piedmont dish of beef marinated in red wine and garlic, and then stewed.\nZabaglione – Rich cream made with eggs, sugar and Marsala wine, served with lady fingers.\nPanettone – Typical Milanese Christmas fruit cake.\nAmaretti – Almond flavored macaroon-type biscuits.\nCheese – A lot of the best Italian cheeses come from this part of the country, including Gorgonzola, Taleggio and Fontina.\nWines: Some of the best wines of Italy come from Piedmont, in particular the Langhe hills, home of two of the most famous red wines, Barolo and Barbaresco. Other lighter red wines that often accompany the local dishes are Dolcetto and Barbera. A lovely aperitivo white sparkling wine is the fruity Moscato d'Asti. It's often served well-chilled at the end of a meal, with dessert.\n \nCentral Italy\nThe food from this part of the country is a very simple, peasant cooking that uses a lot of extra virgin olive oil, tomatoes, beans, hams and salami. Fresh fish is available along the coast.\nSome typical dishes:\nCured meats and hams – A platter of sliced Parma Ham, prosciutto cotto (cooked ham), mortadella, wild boar salami, which is often presented as hors d'oeuvres.\nCrostini – Toasted bite-sized pieces of bread topped with olive, anchovy, tomato, liver or mushroom paste.\nTortellini – Egg pasta stuffed with meat or cheese, served either in a broth or topped with a rich tomato sauce.\nRigatoni al ragu – Typical dish from Bologna, the pasta is covered with a rich tomato sauce cooked with minced beef.\nCannelloni – Large stuffed pasta tubes filled with cheese and spinach or minced beef, coated with tomato and cheese sauce.\nBistecca alla Fiorentina – Very large tender steak grilled over open fire, generally seasoned only with a little salt and olive oil.\nCinghiale – Wild boar, generally grilled, typical of the Maremma area in Tuscany.\nPanforte – Rich nut cake spiced with cinnamon and cloves.\nRicciarelli – These biscuits are made from almond flour, orange peel and honey.\nCantucci – Sweet nut biscuits generally served at the end of a meal with Vin Santo, a dessert wine.\nWines: Everywhere you look in central Italy you can find vineyards. The best come from the hills of South-eastern Tuscany, like the red Chianti Classico, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano or the Brunello di Montalcino wines. Lovely white wines that generally accompany a traditional dinner are the Tuscan Vernaccia di Gimignano, a fresh, dry Orvieto Classico from Umbria, or a crisp particular Verdicchio from the Marche region.\n \nRome and Lazio\n\"Cucina Romanesca\" relies on using fresh seasonal products from the countryside near Rome. Typical vegetables include artichokes, mushrooms, and the ever-present, strongly flavored rughetta selvaggia – arugola or rocket salad. Most dishes are very richly seasoned with garlic, sage, bay leaves and onions, and often topped with grated Pecorino, a strong flavored goat's cheese.\nSome typical dishes:\nCarciofi Fritti – Artichokes dipped in batter and deep fried in oil.\nFiori di zucca – Zucchini flowers stuffed with mozzarella cheese and anchovies, dipped in batter and fried.\nSuppli di riso – Rice croquettes with mozzarella filling, covered in bread crumbs and fried.\nFiletti di Baccala – Fried battered cod fillets, one of the main dishes in the Roman Jewish cuisine, like the fried artichokes.\nGnocchi alla Romana – Semolina dumplings grilled with grated cheese and melted butter.\nBucatini all'Amatriciana – Spaghetti style pasta with a rich tomato, onion and bacon sauce, and served with grated pecorino.\nSpaghetti alla Carbonara – This creamy pasta dish is made with fresh eggs, crispy bacon, parmesan cheese and grated black pepper.\nSaltimbocca alla Romana – Veal slices skewered with ham and sage leaves.\nCoda alla Vaccianara – Braised oxtail cooked in a spiced tomato sauce, typical of Rome.\nTorta alla Ricotta – Cheesecake filled with ricotta, lemon and candied fruit.\nWines: The Romans began wine-producing over 2,000 years ago on the same hills that still surround the city of Rome. Roman wines are all made from the same variety of grape, the Trebbiano, so most local wines, from the Frascati to the Colli Albani or Marino are white, and fairly similar in taste. Local red is rather rare; Romans drink reds from other parts of the country. A meal is often accompanied not by wine but a chilled beer, generally a Moretti or a Nastro Azzurro, light Italian lagers.\nSouth\nYou can distinguish southern cuisine because of its wide variety of seafood, fresh tasty vegetables, rich olive oil, and, of course, basil and oregano. All this makes it one of the most healthful, most envied diets in the world. The best Italian olives come from the Puglia Region, and are often marinated in garlic oil or covered with crushed chili.\nSome typical dishes:\nMaccheroni con le Sarde – Typical Sicilian pasta dish with sardines, pine nuts, raisins and bread crumbs.\nFrutti di Mare – Sauteed mussels and cockles. Char-grilled lobster, prawns or scampi and squid generally dressed with olive oil and some lemon juice.\nPizza Napoletana – Soft crust pizza with tomato, garlic, anchovies and oregano. This is only one of many ways of topping pizza.\nPesce Spada – A favorite in Sicily, swordfish steak is generally grilled, accompanied by eggplants cooked in a sweet and sour tomato sauce (Caponata).\nCassata Siciliana – Ricotta cheese and candied fruit covered by marzipan.\nTorrone – A sweet nougat with nuts and almonds, often served during the Christmas season.\nCannoli alla Siciliana – Tube-shaped biscuits stuffed with ricotta cheese, chocolate chips and candied fruit.\nCheese – Battipaglia, near Naples, is home to the world famous Mozzarella di Bufala, made with buffalo milk and often served with sliced tomatoes and basil leaves  – the classic Caprese Salad. Scamorza, generally served grilled with Parma Ham, which is typical of Basilicata. Provolone, either mild or piquant, and ricotta cheese, used both for pasta dishes and for desserts.\nWines: Since the bronze age, wine has been produced in the south of Italy. The biggest regional producer of wine in Italy is Puglia, and some of the best Italian wines come from Sicily. Marsala wine – it takes its name from its city – has been in production since the 18th century, when it became famous thanks to Admiral Nelson, who ordered huge quantities of it after the Battle of the Nile.\n \nSample Tour Menus\nMost Perillo Tours include breakfast and dinner daily. Our typical menus, served in carefully selected restaurants and hotel dining rooms, will offer a variety of authentic regional food and wine selected specifically to delight you!  If you've saved room for lunch, you may venture out to sample additional italian fare.\nHere are some sample set dinner menus, similar to those you might be offered on one of our tours:\nMilan Jolly Touring Risotto with saffron and porcini mushrooms and vegetable puree soup.

Explained!\nHome » All Articles » Food & Wine » Pasta Names and Shapes… Explained!\nPasta Names and Shapes… Explained!\nFarfalle, or \"butterfly,\" pasta\nOrecchiette, an interestingly-shaped pasta from Puglia, gives away its shape with its Italian name…\nEver wanted to learn how to make your own delicious pasta from an expert Italian chef? We’d love to teach you in Rome with our ever-popular pasta-making class !\nBucatini, spaghetti, tortellini, rigatoni: There are hundreds of kinds of Italian pastas, and each one has its own, special name. That’s pretty confusing… but it’s also fun!\nWe’ve said many times before that Italian food is regional (in fact, there’s no such thing as “Italian food”). Pasta is a major part of that. Local kinds of pasta in Tuscany differ from those in Rome, Milan, or Puglia.\nFor us, though, one of the really fun things about Italian pasta—and the names of Italian pastas—are that each pasta name actually means something. Usually, in fact, the name gives away the shape of the pasta itself.\nWant proof? Here are just some of our favorite pastas, and what their names mean in Italian!\nBucatini all’amatriciana, a popular dish in Rome\nBucatini: One of the most popular kinds of pasta in Rome, bucatini look like thick spaghetti—but they have a tiny hole in the middle. (Think of a Twizzler!). What does bucatini mean? “Little holes!”. (Buco means hole, while adding an –ino, or –ini for plural, means “small”).\nCannelloni: These big tubes of pasta (usually stuffed and popped in the oven) are named after, well, “big tubes.” (Adding -one, or –oni for plural, means “big”).\nFarfalle, or “butterfly,” pasta\nFarfalle: This pasta might have the prettiest name of them all… “butterflies”! Hence the shape—of a bow tie, or (more creatively) a butterfly.\nFettuccine: This flat, ribbon-shaped pasta is named after, you guessed it, “little ribbons.”\nFusilli pasta might just be named after… rifles!\nFusilli: This pasta is thought to come from the word “fucile,” or “rifle”. Makes sense because fusilli are spiral-shaped… as is the inside barrel of a gun.\nLinguine: This flattened, long pasta is named after “little tongues” (tongues: lingue, and the -in makes them “small”).\nOrecchiette: This pasta, unique to the region of Puglia, means “little ears.” Sure enough, it’s an ear-shaped pasta.\nPenne: An easy one, penne means “pens.” Next time you have a bowl of penne, check it out: The end of each piece of penne is similar to the tip of a fountain pen.\nSpaghetti: Spaghi are “twines”; an -ett makes them small, so these are “little twines.” Perfect, right?\nStrozzapreti pasta\nStrozzapreti: From central Italy, especially Emilia-Romagna, Umbria and Tuscany, this pasta might have the strangest name of them all: “priest-strangler.” No one’s exactly sure where the name comes from. Some think it’s because priests loved the pasta so much, they ate too quickly and choked.\nVermicelli: In Italy, this is a tubular pasta that’s a little thicker than spaghetti. The name means “little worms.” Sounds gross—but, of course, tastes great!\n(Check out the video below to learn how to make carbonara, a classic Roman pasta, from scratch!).\nWhat’s your favorite pasta—or pasta name?

Eat up!\nI confirm I am at least 21 years old\nFollow Thrillist\nThe 'Power Rangers' Movie Looks a Million Times Better Than You'd Think\nEvery state in our gluttonously blessed union shines in its own way, and as always-hungry Americans, it's our solemn duty to find the single brightest source of that sparkle and take a big bite. It wasn't easy an easy task, but after polling our network of writers, friends, and distant family with strong opinions about hot tamales, we've compiled a list of the single food that you simply must eat in every state.\nOur criteria is admittedly loose. Some foods are the states' most famous exports, while others are icons that you won't see outside of their borders. For some dishes you want to go with the original that started it all, and other times a new-school innovator has taken things to a savory extreme that's just way more delicious. If you've got your own reasoning behind a different pick, let us know in the comments, as we always have room for seconds. Here are the must-eat foods in every state (and DC).\nAlabama: Fried catfish\nEzell’s Fish Camp ( address and info )\nButler\nWe debated everything from West Indies salad at Bayley's, to BBQ with white sauce at Big Bob Gibson’s , to fried green tomatoes, well, everywhere. Eventually, though, we landed on fried catfish and hushpuppies, a specialty up and down the state’s muddy rivers and an iconic Southern plate of golden fried food. Ezell’s Fish Camp now has multiple locations, but go to the original in tiny Butler for the true experience. Opened in the ‘30s, the family-owned restaurant (and, initially, family-run fishing camp) hauls the giant fish out of the nearby Tombigbee, fries up the filets, and serves them alongside dense hushpuppies. Be sure to get the slaw as another side.\nRelated\nEl Norteño ( address and info )\nPhoenix\nWhether Arizona’s claim of inventing the chimichanga is irrelevant: the act of dunking a burrito in a deep-fryer is an act of American ingenuity akin to putting hot dogs on a stick, and Arizona makes them better than anyone. And we’d venture El Norteño makes them better than anyone else in Arizona. It’s an old-school, counter-service spot where an asada chimichanga brings an unexpected heat, and only gets better when topped with red chile, sour cream, and cheese. Now if somebody just put one on a stick…\n \nMcClard’s Bar-B-Q Restaurant ( address and info )\nHot Springs \nWe’ve long been fans of the spa town’s iconic restaurant and its fantastic spicy sauce. And the best vehicle to sop up that sauce is its fantastic chopped beef, which tastes of hickory and secrets and love. Oh, also: you need to get a tamale. Or a dozen tamales. And maybe a gallon of sauce to bring home. \n \nLa Taqueria ( address and info )\nSan Francisco\nReady for a rather obvious statement of fact? California is a giant place with lots of iconic foods. And while we do have a place in our hearts for the California burritos stuffed with fries and fish tacos of SoCal, we must go with our one true love: the Mission burrito. Yes, yes, it won all sorts of awards when Nate Silver used science and then people to cook up a huge burrito bracket, but we’ve been spouting off about the carnitas at La Taqueria for as long as Thrillist has been in SF, and its hard to argue with the perfection that is its super burrito, especially if you’re going to finish it off with those green/red salsas that are sitting on the table.\nEl Taco de Mexico ( address and info )\nDenver\nYes, a breakfast burrito covered in green chile is perfect stoner food, but it was a breakfast staple in CO way, way before the other green stuff was legalized. There are seven ridiculously tasty spots in Denver to snag tortilla-wrapped heaven, but you can't go wrong at El Taco de Mexico, with a chorizo, rice, beans, and egg burrito smothered in green chile. And unlike some chains that shut the breakfast hose off at 11am, it doesn't have to be breakfast time for you to to order one -- it serves the morning meal all day long.\n \nFrank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana ( address and info )\nNew Haven\nIn what may come as a surprise to most folks who've never been to the state, Connecticut's best food isn't, in fact, a single Saltine eaten at a boarding school. In fact, New Haven's got a pizza scene that rivals that of New York in the overall quality of its pies. Pepe's has been running this scene since the '20s, ferrying exquisitely charred crusts from coal-fired ovens into the clamoring mouths of a cultish following whose members rarely, if ever, overlap with close competitor Sally's. Pepe's \"apizzas\" are so old school, they come without cheese by default, so make sure you request some mozz or you'll have to wait in line for another hour to get seconds.\n \nChelsea Tavern ( address and info )\nWilmington\nOther than Dogfish Head and the beach, people often don't know much about what happens in The First State. Scrapple happens there. More scrapple is made in Bridgeville than anywhere in the world. As for what the hell scrapple is... it's a secret! OK, fine. It's essentially the parts of the pig no one wants to eat. But it's tradition in the DE/PA area, and people there eat it at brunch as part of a balanced breakfast. Chelsea Tavern in Wilmington offers it two ways -- as a side, or as scrapple hash, where it's mixed up with home fries, spicy ketchup, and an egg.\n \nEnriqueta's ( address and info )\nMiami\nJust because Tampa invented the Cuban sandwich doesn't mean its crazy contraption with salami is the best. No, the honor for best Cuban sandwich -- and food item -- in the state goes to a Cuban made in Dade. At this tiny cafeteria wedged in between artsy Wynwood and high-rising Midtown, you'll get ham, roast pork, Swiss, mustard, and mayo on fresh-baked and pressed Cuban bread. And while there's always debate about the best Cuban sandwich in Miami , this is the best one you'll find.\nHome Grown ( address and info )\nAtlanta\nOther than Outkast, Georgia's greatest export to the rest of the country is undoubtedly the chicken biscuit. Combining two great sources of Southern pride into one flaky, battery protein hand grenade isn't rocket science, but it does explode taste buds unlike any other Southern staple. If we were judging biscuits alone, Silver Skillet might get the nod (we're suckers for grandmothers' recipes), but the total package is at Home Grown, whose massive buttermilk-brined chicken breasts sprawl onto a bed of biscuit, then get drowned in sausage gravy that tastes just as good as it looks.\n \nLeonard’s Bakery ( address and info )\nHonolulu\nWith respect to laulau, poke, loco moco, Spam musubi, and plate lunches everywhere, the most delicious of all the famously iconic Hawaiian foods has to be its take on the Portuguese donut known as the malasada. And no one in Hawaii has made them longer and better than Leonard’s, especially if you opt for the traditional sugar-covered, or feel like getting a little chubbier with the custard-style.\n \nBoise Fry Co. ( address and info )\nBoise\nWhen we named Boise Fry Company’s original bison burger best in the state , we kind of knew the answer to Idaho’s best fries as well. And while the state does amazing things with other foodstuffs, the humble fry is forever associated with Idaho. Yes, still get that bison burger, but go in with the expectation that it might actually take a backseat to the spuds, which you can customize by potato type (sweet, purple, gold) and cut (regular, shoestring, homestyle, balls, and waffle are among the shapes), then pick seasonings and sauces that range from blueberry ketchup to roasted garlic. Basically, the options are limitless. Suddenly, the potato doesn’t seem so humble.\nJohnnie's Beef ( address and info )\nElmwood Park\nDeep dish and dogs are generally the first foodstuffs sought by tourists. Downstate, you'll find heart-stopping horseshoes and some celebrated BBQ. But if you want to start a real argument, especially in the Chicago area, start talking about Italian beef, sort of like an Italian riff on a French dip to the uninitiated, and much, much more than that to those who get it. Be warned: you have decisions to make. Should you get it dipped (the whole damn sandwich dunked in the rich, spice-laden pan gravy), wet (an extra ladle full poured over the ribbons of beefy goodness held together by a soft roll), or dry (what's wrong with you?). Then it's onto the peppers. Will it be sweet (grilled green and/or red bells) or hot (giardiniera, a glorious relish of spicy pickled vegetables that varies from place to place)? It's a lot to figure out, so don't sweat where to get one. Just go to Johnnie's.\n \nMrs. Wick's Pies ( address and info )\nWinchester\nThe shrimp cocktail at St. Elmo's is a memorable experience, and some Hoosiers are certain to be angry about Iowa getting the nod on pork tenderloin sandwiches (and to be sure, they have many a fine rendition as well), but there's something sweetly soul-satisfying about a sugar cream pie (does anyone dislike ANY of those words?). Wick's has built an empire on these custardy delights (it'll ship all over), but like so many things, they're another experience altogether tasted fresh from the source. Trek out to the small town of Winchester (about 90 minutes west of Indianapolis), order a slice, and enjoy forkful after forkful as three of the most perfect English words dance through your head. Sugar. Cream. Pie.\n \nBreitbach's Country Dining ( address and info )\nSherrill\nHog farming is serious business in Iowa, and so are breaded pork tenderloin sandwiches, one of the meaty fruits (sure, why not) of said farming. You can't go wrong with the version at Breitbach's (now on its sixth generation of owners dating back to the 1850s), though you might be violating doctor's orders to restrict your pork intake. You'll find a hubcap-sized serving of tenderloin, pounded thin, battered, and impossibly juicy. You'll also find a tiny burger-sized bun and smattering of fixin's that are completely dwarfed by the pork's presence. Do not be alarmed. Embrace the pork. It is your destiny.\nrelated\nJoe's Kansas City Bar-B-Que ( address and info )\nKansas City\nYes, burnt ends are the Kansas City signature, and Joe's has some of the best around (on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, at least). And they also make a perfect brisket, which is just fine on its own. But the Z-Man somehow makes it even better, stacking onion rings, smoked provolone, and the signature meat on a kaiser roll. We keep going back to it when we think of KC BBQ. We don't know how to quit you, Z-Man.\n \nThe Brown Hotel ( address and info )\nLouisville\nSometimes, the original isn’t the best. Just look at Terminator 2. Or Gallagher II, for that matter. But when it comes to the Hot Brown -- Kentucky's legendary open-face turkey, bacon, and Mornay sauce masterpiece -- the original at the Brown Hotel remains the best. With respect to the Colonel and Billy Ray Cyrus, it’s the tastiest icon Kentucky has birthed.\n \nDooky Chase's Restaurant ( address and info )\nNew Orleans\nEven more than boudin sausage and po-boys, gumbo represents Louisiana’s entire attitude toward food: it’s a rich, deeply flavored stew that utilizes whatever’s bountiful in the season, shows off the state’s unique heritage, and is meant to draw in the family and neighbors for a shared meal. Dooky Chase's serves our favorite Creole gumbo, laden with andouille, veal, shrimp, and oysters, and thickened with a dash of filé. But if you can make it to NOLA on the week before Easter, you may be able to grab a bowl of its gumbo z’herbes, a rarely seen green gumbo made for Holy Thursday, and preserved in the culinary tradition of the region by Leah Chase, the restaurant’s matriarch.\nThe Clam Shack ( address and info )\nKennebunkport \nOur NY editor Andrew Zimmer spent the summer eating his way through lobster roll joints all around the East Coast , which is alarming in its own right, but also makes him a verifiable expert in the field, and through all his travels, he never encountered anyone more passionate about lobster than Steve Kingston, the owner of The Clam Shack. From him: “Steve only serves 'new' shell because the meat is sweeter and more tender, and he has his own lobstermen he uses to supply him so he knows exactly what he’s getting. He keeps them in seawater, instead of cold water -- because he sells so many so quickly he doesn’t have to worry about them eating each other -- then boils them in salt water, shucks them fresh, and cools them on ice. The actual roll isn’t a hot dog roll, it’s a tasty white bread round roll from a local bakery called Reilly’s, and the house choice for how to get it is with both Kate’s local Maine butter AND Ken’s extra heavy mayo. It’s so (swear word) delicious.” So… there. \n \nFaidley Seafood and Fresh Fish Market ( address and info )\nBaltimore\nWe'll happily line up for a Baltimore pit beef on a Kaiser roll any day of the week, but when in a port state, nothing tastes sweeter than the local catch. Faidley's seafood stall is the most popular destination at the iconic Lexington Market, where Nancy Faidley-Devine dishes out 6.5oz patties of lump crab bonded by a dream team of crushed Saltines, mayo, egg, Dijon, Worcestershire, and Tabasco. The golden results are so renowned that NASA commissioned the Faidleys to make an astronaut-friendly version of the recipe, but for those unable to travel to either Maryland or outer space, Faidley's does the kindness of shipping its crab cakes anywhere in the States.\n \nWoodman’s of Essex ( address and info )\nEssex\nThough Mass doesn’t have the same claim to lobster rolls as Maine, its North Shore is allegedly where fried clams got their start, thanks to the abundance of clam beds around Ipswich and Essex. Woodman’s, which will turn 100 next year, is our favorite of all of the quality fried-clam joints around these parts (and there are many), thanks to a recipe it's kept basically intact for that entire century. It involves lard, deliciousness, and salty New England secrets. Oh, and it might not count, but you might as well get a couple of Nana Bessie’s clam cakes while you’re there. And some of Gifford’s ice cream. And some pants with an elastic waistband.\n \nMackinaw Pastie & Cookie Co. ( address and info )\nMackinaw City\nWhile we can debate for days who makes the best coney among the hundreds of options in Michigan (even though the answer is  Angelo’s in Flint ), nothing short of a leg full of black fly bites is more pure Michigan than the pasty, a humble Cornish-style, hand-held pie stuffed traditionally with beef, potatoes, and love. And while there are myriad amazing spots throughout upper Michigan and the UP that go under the radar, the Mackinaw Pastie & Cookie Co. is the meeting ground between peninsulas, offering up a perfect take on Michigan’s truest comfort food. At the risk of sounding like a troll, we recommend it covered in gravy. But really, ketchup -- or plain -- is fine too.\nMatt's Bar ( address and info )\nMinneapolis\nPhiladelphia may have its cheesesteak, Chicago its hot dog, and New York its pizza, but Minneapolis was the birth place of the best signature dish of all: lutefisk, with its pungent lye flav... wait, no. It was the birthplace of this gloriously cheese-stuffed burger, supposedly invented at a place called Matt’s Bar some time in the late 1950s, when a customer requested a burger with cheese in the center, and Matt lovingly obliged. When he bit into it, the customer apparently exclaimed, “that's one jucy Lucy!”, apparently because vulgarity (specifically the phrase OMFG!) and the letter \"I\" hadn’t yet been invented. Thankfully, a brand-new kind of burger had been invented, and while there are now plenty of great spots to get one -- the Nook, the 5-8 Club (which also claims to have invented this thing), etc. -- the original is still the best.\n \nScott's Hot Tamales ( address and info )\nGreenville\nIn the Delta, nothing rolls into the mouth, or off of the tongue, quite like a hot 'amale. The history of the corn-husked snack is well documented by the Southern Foodways Alliance , which has interviewed the best of the best (nobody pronounces that second \"t\"!). It'd be an impossible task to pick the most delicious... if it weren't for help from the judges of the Delta Hot Tamale Festival, who most recently crowned Scott's brisket tamale the best of the commercial category. The original proprietor, Elizabeth Scott, retired in 2001 (after 41 years in business), and can still be seen hanging around the tiny roadside stand, but these days it's her children and grandchildren who are rolling the shucks. Lucky for anyone who passes by, good taste still runs in the family.\n \nPappy's Smokehouse ( address and info )\nSt. Louis\nRule-breaking pitmaster Mike “Smokey” Emerson might turn the heads of St. Louis bone-lickers who expect a pint of sauce on a a rack of spares, but they become believers once they've tasted his gospel: dry-rubbed baby backs bathed in apple and cherrywood smoke for 14 hours, then given a light glaze in tribute to the saucier versions you'll see at neighboring joints. It's our rib choice among the crowded field of pitmasters because he's not hiding behind sauce, but is enough of a gentlemen to offer three bottles on the table. The one caveat might be that this is the best thing to eat in the state before 7pm, because Pappy's is known to sell out of the nearly full ton of meat it cooks every day.\n \nLand of Magic ( address and info )\nLogan\nYou can get great beef and bison throughout Montana, but we’re pretty partial to the no-frills, perfectly grilled ribeye at this Logan spot, which balances rustic aesthetics with high-end meat that probably was roaming down the street earlier in the day. There’s nothing fancy here -- you're in Montana, so expect timber-clad walls and cowboy-hatted company -- just a perfect cut of beef, cooked exactly how you like it. In a state where a great steak can be had in even the dustiest saloons, it stands tall.\nCrescent Moon ( address and info )\nOmaha\nWith respect to every effin’ New York deli owner, the combination of rye, sauerkraut, corned beef, and Thousand Island dressing hails from the Midwest’s least-conspicuous state. The Blackstone Hotel invented it, and the Crescent Moon -- also the state’s best beer bar -- has retained the original recipe. It’s the best of its kind, and though we’re also all about  runzas , the Reuben is still king.\n \nGolden Gate Casino and Hotel ( address and info )\nLas Vegas\nWe were tempted to go all-in with a buffet, but concluded that an all-you-can-eat situation is the food equivalent of asking a genie for unlimited wishes, which is clearly not allowed. Genie rules aside, the one dish that sums up Las Vegas more than anything else is the shrimp cocktail. For best in show, we're placing our bet at the Golden Gate Casino, which originated the dish in 1959 for a meager 99 cents. Inflation's increased the cost slightly, but admiration for its sundae dish full of cocktail sauce-drenched shrimp has remained the same.\n \nMarkey’s Lobster Pool ( address and info )\nSeabrook\nNew Hampshire is a tough state to pick a signature food. It has all the elements of the other New England states, but it's just known for doing them the same way. And it’s not like we’re going to pick Burdick’s chocolate mice or Stonyfield yogurt. With that said, we’ve picked one of the best of the signature eats from an iconic NH beach spot to do the job. Markey’s has been around since 1971 on the Seacoast, and while it's got a lot of good traditional New England clam shack dishes, the fried lobster tail on the lobster plate stands out. Other places consider the lobster too precious a commodity to fry up, and that’s A BIG MISTAKE ON THEIR PART. These tails stay juicy on the inside and deliver a pretty damn good signature dish for The Granite State. No offense to those little chocolate rodents.\n \nFrank's Deli and Restaurant ( address and info )\nAsbury Park\nWhen Tony Bourdain stopped by Frank's, he went with an Italian sub, but anyone from Jersey can tell you that one of the things they miss most when they leave is pork roll, aka Taylor Ham, aka a cylindrical tube of not-quite-bologna that could challenge Folgers for the title of best thing about waking up. You can get them anywhere in the state, but our ex-pat source sang the praises of Frank's as the finest in the land, so very fine that she would have it driven across state lines. Hit it with a little SPK (salt/pepper/ketchup) and there's no better way to start a day in The Garden State.\n \nTune-Up Cafe ( address and info )\nSanta Fe\nAll due respect to the fantastic and widely praised green chile burger at Santa Fe Bite, but we think the greatest chile-based dish in this state happens to involve chicken enchiladas at Tune-Up Cafe. Also, isn’t the term “Christmas-style” just kind of the greatest of all shorthands? And isn’t it even better that it involves mixing red and green chile?\nrelated\nDi Fara ( address and info )\nNew York City\nThere's perhaps nothing more authentically New York than a dollar slice or a dirty-water dog, but both of those are typically consumed in lessened states of judgement, followed by heightened sense of heartburn. For the single best thing to eat in a state blessed with every food imaginable, we skipped the dog and went with a slice, albeit a $5 one. Di Fara has been in business since 1964, and even the finest-dining restaurants can't make a claim to the level of auteurship that comes with the owner's hands touching every single pie. Hell, on our NYC pizza ranking he was called the city's equivalent of Jiro. Accordingly, that personal touch results in a lengthy wait time, but it's worth it for such a once-in-a-lifetime slice.\n \nSkylight Inn BBQ ( address and info )\nAyden\nIf North Carolina had to choose a patron saint, it would have to be the humble hog. Dividing lines aside, Piedmont and Eastern can both agree that if you travel to The Tar Heel State, it'd be a sin not to put some pig in your mouth. People have spent lifetimes arguing on porches over Clyde Cooper's or Lexington BBQ or Red Bridges or just the first smokehouse you can find, but in terms of pure chopped-pork bliss, the must-eat bite is the freshly picked whole hog from Skylight Inn, with just the right amount of crispy skin mixed in, a fist's worth of slaw, and several generations' worth of history.\n \nHoDo Lounge ( address and info )\nFargo\nLook, we could pretend to like knoephla dumplings and whatever lutefisk is, but North Dakota is the home where the buffalo roam, and sometimes the best thing you can get in a state with little culinary identity is a burger. And while we can’t deny the greatness of a no-frills burger with a side of wood paneling at Bismarck’s Wood House, we’re also suckers for the fancier version at Fargo’s HoDo. The lean, rare patty comes garnished with shallot jam and aged cheddar, but don’t let the frills fool you. The meat is front and center. Just like on the North Dakota quarter!\nCamp Washington Chili ( address and info )\nCincinnati\nCleveland has its Polish Boy. Parma has its pierogies. The world has the slider. But Cincinnati’s famous chili is the true icon, and though Skyline claims the most fame, our beans are on Camp Washington. Logic dictates to get it 5 Ways -- chili, onions, cheese, beans, and spaghetti -- though we also recommend it on a hot dog. Or a burger. Or on fries. Or in a bowl. Really, get it however you want. You’re in a chili parlor, after all, not a Left Eye one.\n \nTucker's Onion Burgers ( address and info )\nOklahoma City\nIf there’s one thing Oklahoma is known for, it’s being home to Chuck Norris, Brad Pitt, AND web video star Kaitlin Witcher. But if there’s another thing, it’s the onion burger. Essentially created during the Depression because onions were cheaper than meat, the onions cook in with the beef on the griddle and make everything taste fantastic. And the best place in the state to get said onion burger is Tucker’s. But be smart and make it a double.\n \nLocal Ocean Seafoods ( address and info )\nNewport\nThere’s a temptation to veer toward Portland, one of the  best food towns in the country , and select anything from Bunk’s pork belly Cubano -- a pioneer in PDX’s movement of high-end chefs making gourmet takes on lowbrow food -- to cart-turned-sauce-empire Nong’s Khao Man Gai or a stupid maple bacon donut. But to the 95% of Oregon that doesn’t own a pair of skinny jeans, Oregon bounty’s about seafood and beef. The former’s at its best at Newport’s Local Ocean, where fresh fish is bought daily and takes on its best form in the rare, bacon-wrapped tuna mignon, which you can usually eat while sharing a beer with the dude who killed it. And because it’s light, you can always chase it with a bacon donut… if you’ve got an hour to wait back in Portland.\nJohn's Roast Pork ( address and info )\nPhiladelphia\nWith apologies to the cheesesteak, the fry-stuffed classic at Primanti’s in Pittsburgh, and pierogies in general, the best thing in this beautiful state filled with gloriously unhealthy eats is one of the most underrated. John’s itself is a legend, and few can withstand the mix of the salty pork, melted sharp provolone, and Popeye-caliber spinach that define Philly's other classic sandwich. Bonus: its cheesesteaks are damn good too.\n \nAl Forno ( address and info )\nProvidence \nThe act of actually grilling a pizza began in Providence over 30 years ago at Al Forno, and has since become the best kind of Rhode Island tradition (sorry Del’s frozen lemonade and johnnycakes). But no one does grilled ‘za with the same skill as the originators, and the best of those is the original margarita, with a three-cheese blend, San Marzano tomatoes, and those signature scallions adding a tang you never seem to get in normal margherita pizza world.\nHominy Grill ( address and info )\nCharleston\nSouth Carolina's a tough call. Its signature cuisine teeter-totters between soul food and barbecue depending on who you ask, but the best bite for us has got to be the shrimp & grits at Hominy Grill. You'll be elbow to elbow with South Carolinians devouring the Charleston Nasty chicken biscuit sandwich, but don't veer from the all-important Southern staple, shrimp & grits. Hominy takes its name from the type of corn used in said grits, which come from a local water-powered mill, then are perfectly cheesed up and studded with a crown of shrimp, crispy bacon, and umami-enhancing veggies (mushrooms, scallions) that make these the kind of true grits even John Wayne couldn't top.\n \nStadium Sports Grill ( address and info )\nBelle Fourche, Spearfish, and Madison\nSouth Dakota’s claim to culinary fame is chislic, which is basically deep-fried beef cubes on a toothpick. Most people outside SoDak don’t know what the hell it is, mainly because it’s gross. The Stadium -- a trio of unassuming sports bars -- offers up a way better variation in the form of tenderloin tips that take a bath in a secret marinade before being getting breaded and fried to order (we recommend rare). For the more voracious, you can even get them served in a taco-salad shell, which you should, because none of the juice goes to waste. And lest you doubt the authenticity of these beauties, take heed: among the restaurants' most loyal clientele are cattle ranchers. They know a thing or two about beef.\n \nPrince’s Hot Chicken Shack ( address and info )\nNashville\nLook, we love Memphis BBQ as much as any self-respecting adult with denial about type-2 diabetes, but by that same logic, we can’t deny the power of red-hued fried chicken that might burn a hole in your esophagus. And the fact is, Prince’s serves the best damn spicy fried chicken in America. Yeah, there will be a line, but that just gives you time to prepare your heart for the heat. Order it “hot” and be prepared to sweat. And whatever you do, don’t rub your eyes while eating.\nrelated\nFranklin Barbecue ( address and info )\nAustin\nNo dish is more Texas than brisket, and no brisket exemplifies the great heights the meat can achieve quite like Franklin Barbecue. Sure, it'll cost you five hours of your life waiting in line, but those 300 minutes melt away as soon as you reach the meat carver and they slice off a fatty hunk of beef candy. The anticipation makes for an even more visceral experience. The pillow-soft fat and sinfully tender meat, wrapped in a blanket of smoke, create one of the most excellent bites of food you can find anywhere.\n \nCrown Burgers ( address and info )\nSalt Lake City\nWhat Utah may lack in alcohol-serving abilities, it makes up for in burger innovation. It's one of the only states where bacon's not the best meat-on-meat topping thanks to a few Greek immigrants who forever altered the local burger landscape back in 1978 by topping their patties with rich shavings of pastrami. Nearly every other local chain followed suit, but the original is still considered the best by most locals thanks to a charbroiled patty flamed to complement the smokiness of the pastrami. The intense meats are tempered by typical burger accessories (lettuce, onion, tomato), a slice of American cheese, and a slap of Thousand Island.\n \nMorse Farm ( address and info )\nMontpelier\nMaple syrup and snow form 95% of all matter in The Green Mountain State, so it's wholly appropriate to make the spring pilgrimage to Morse Farm in Montpelier for some hot maple action. Heated maple syrup is drizzled over shaved ice and it makes for taffy-like sweetness that pairs perfectly with a fresh donut.\nStove ( address and info )\nPortsmouth\nIn Virginia, ham is king. But don’t think that it’s just limited to your gramdma’s favorite Christmas fare. At Stove, it’s made by a dude who prefers the title of “cowboy” to “chef,” and he prefers his cured meat to be called by its real name: Smoochie Bear ham. And while a big plate of Smoochie would be fine and dandy, he ups the ante with the Pork O Rama plate, which also includes slow-roasted pork belly, house-made sausage, and pork belly jam. Maybe this is what Jay-Z was talking about?\n \nEtta's ( address and info )\nSeattle\nYou know all those dudes on Deadliest Catch? Most of 'em are from Seattle, and when they're not on TV chasing the less flavorful, and wayyy more scary looking Alaskan king crab, they're down here catching the key ingredient in Washington's greatest food achievement: the Dungeness crab cake. It'd be stupid to ruin the subtle, sweet flavor, and tender texture of Dungeness crab by frying it like they do with blue crabs in Maryland, so chefs here -- most notably Tom Douglas, who has a whole book about crab cakes -- pack it loosely with breadcrumbs and other stuff before lightly grilling it. The result is a crunchy treat that actually still tastes like crab and can be found at almost any restaurant in the Pacific Northwest, but you owe it to yourself to get your crab cakes at Douglas' Pike Place Market spot, Etta's. Or one of his other restaurants where they're on the menu.\n \nMeats & Foods ( address and info )\nWashington DC\nBen's Chili Bowl gets most of DC's half-smoke hype (that'll happen when you're a longtime local institution and Obama shows up for a visit), but if you're judging on taste (and you should be!), no one's doing this local sausage delicacy (think a big, smoked, spicy hot dog with a coarser ground) better than Meats & Foods, which makes its spicier-than-expected rendition daily in-house. Get it properly topped with its chili, a squirt of mustard, and some finely diced onion -- make sure you have a stack of napkins at the ready -- and go to town. \n \nCountry Club Bakery ( address and info )\nFairmont\nMuch like crushed red pepper and the Noid, pepperoni just doesn't get much respect outside of the world of pizza. But in West Virginia, the humble meat stars in a proto Hot Pocket originally created to light the dark lunch depths of coal mines. It's another case where the original set the bar and its simplicity has never been surpassed. For $6.50 you can score a dozen of the Country Club Bakery's yeasty white rolls stuffed with sticks of meat whose juicy oils permeate the bread when baked, resulting in a pepperoni-flavored starch bomb that much like a Bagel Bite, can be consumed in the morning, evening, or at suppertime.\nKopp's Frozen Custard ( address and info )\nGreenfield, Brookfield, Bayshore\nFrozen custard is as ingrained into Wisconsin culture as the Packers and PBR. Kopp's is the standard by which all other custards are measured, with flavors ranging from orange dream made with local Sprecher's soda to Snickers chunky cheesecake, though humble vanilla is the best around.\n \nPitchfork Fondue ( address and info )\nPinedale\nLook, if you want a great steak in Wyoming, you can get one pretty much anywhere with swinging saloon doors. (Might we recommend the Virginian in Buffalo’s Occidental Hotel? Teddy Roosevelt sure did.) But what’s the point in being in a state where you can do whatever you want if you don’t eat a steak that’s skewered on a pitchfork, dumped into a vat of hot oil, and served sizzling in a cookout setting 8,000ft above sea level? That’s what you get at this seasonal spot, which takes what sounds like a punchline about Western living and transforms it into one of the most memorable meals you’ll ever have. It’s basically the cowboy equivalent of a Brazilian steakhouse, only you won’t be embarrassed when you try to speak Spanish to a person who only understands Portuguese.\nSign up here for our daily Thrillist email, and get your fix of the best in food/drink/fun.\nDan Gentile is a staff writer on Thrillist's national food and drink team.

                "Howard Robard Hughes, Jr. (December 24, 1905 – April 5, 1976) was an American business tycoon, entrepreneur, investor, aviator, aerospace engineer, inventor, filmmaker and philanthropist. During his life, he was known as one of the most financially successful individuals in the world. As a maverick film tycoon, Hughes gained prominence in Hollywood from the late 1920s, making big-budget and often controversial films like The Racket (1928), Hell's Angels (1930), Scarface (1932), and The Outlaw (1943).\n\nHughes formed the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1932, hiring numerous engineers and designers. He spent the rest of the 1930s setting multiple world air speed records and building the Hughes H-1 Racer and H-4 Hercules (now better known as the \"Spruce Goose\"). He also acquired and expanded Trans World Airlines (TWA, subsequently acquired by and merged with American Airlines)  and later acquired Air West, renaming it Hughes Airwest. Hughes Airwest was eventually acquired by and merged into Republic Airlines.\n\nHughes was included in Flying Magazine's list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation, ranking at  25.  He is remembered for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle in later life, caused in part by a worsening obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and chronic pain. His legacy is maintained through the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nEarly years\n\nHughes' birthplace is recorded as either Humble or Houston, Texas. The date is uncertain, though Hughes claimed that his birthday was Christmas Eve. A 1941 affidavit birth certificate of Hughes, signed by his aunt Annette Gano Lummis and Estelle Boughton Sharp, states that he was born on December 24, 1905, in Harris County, Texas. However, his baptismal record of October 7, 1906, in the parish register of St. John's Episcopal Church in Keokuk, Iowa, has his birth listed as September 24, 1905, without reference to the place of birth.\n\nHis parents were Howard R. Hughes, Sr., a successful inventor and businessman from Missouri of English descent,  and Allene Stone Gano. His father had patented the two-cone roller bit, which allowed rotary drilling for petroleum in previously inaccessible places. The senior Hughes made the shrewd and lucrative decision to commercialize the invention by leasing the bits instead of selling them, and founded the Hughes Tool Company in 1909. Hughes' uncle was the famed novelist, screenwriter, and film director Rupert Hughes.\n\nHughes demonstrated interest in science and technology at a young age. In particular, he had great engineering aptitude, building Houston's first \"wireless\" radio transmitter at age 11.[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553204/Howard_Hughes.html \"Howard Hughes.\"] MSN Encarta online, October 21, 2009. Retrieved: January 5, 2008. He went on to be one of the first licensed ham radio operators in Houston, having the assigned callsign W5CY (originally 5CY).  At 12, Hughes was photographed in the local newspaper, identified as being the first boy in Houston to have a \"motorized\" bicycle, which he had built from parts from his father's steam engine.  He was an indifferent student, with a liking for mathematics, flying, and mechanics. He took his first flying lesson at 14, and later attended math and aeronautical engineering courses at Caltech.\n\nAllene Hughes died in March 1922 from complications of an ectopic pregnancy. Howard Hughes, Sr., died of a heart attack in 1924. Their deaths apparently inspired Hughes to include the creation of a medical research laboratory in the will that he signed in 1925 at age 19. Howard Sr.'s will had not been updated since Allene's death, and Hughes inherited 75 percent of the family fortune.  On his 19th birthday, Hughes was declared an emancipated minor, enabling him to take full control of his life. \n\nHughes was an excellent and enthusiastic golfer from a young age, often scoring near par figures, and held a handicap of three during his twenties. He played frequently with top players, including Gene Sarazen. Hughes rarely played competitively, and gradually gave up his passion for the sport to pursue other interests. \n\nHughes withdrew from  Rice University shortly after his father's death. On June 1, 1925, he married Ella Botts Rice, daughter of David Rice and Martha Lawson Botts of Houston. They moved to Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a name for himself as a filmmaker.\n\nBusiness career\n\nHughes enjoyed a highly successful business career beyond engineering, aviation, and filmmaking, though many of his career endeavors involved varying entrepreneurial roles. The Summa Corporation was the name adopted for the business interests of Howard Hughes after he sold the tool division of Hughes Tool Company in 1972. The company serves as the principal holding company for Hughes' business ventures and investments. It is primarily involved in aerospace and defense, electronics, mass media, manufacturing, and hospitality industries, but has maintained a strong presence in a wide variety of industries including real estate, petroleum drilling and oilfield services, consulting, entertainment, and mining. Much of his fortune was later used for philanthropic causes, notably towards health care and medical research.\n\nEntertainment\n\nHughes entered the entertainment industry after dropping out of Rice University and moving to Los Angeles. His first two films, Everybody's Acting (1927) and Two Arabian Knights (1928), were financial successes, the latter winning the first Academy Award for Best Director of a comedy picture.  The Racket (1928) and The Front Page (1931) were also nominated for Academy Awards.\n\nHughes spent $3.8 million to make the flying film Hell's Angels (1930). It earned nearly $8 million, about double the production and advertising costs. Hell's Angels received one Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.\n\nHe produced another hit, Scarface (1932), a production delayed by censors' concern over its violence.\n\nThe Outlaw (1943) was completed in 1941 and featured Jane Russell. It also received considerable attention from industry censors, this time owing to Russell's revealing costumes. Hughes designed a special bra for his leading lady, although Russell decided against wearing it.\n\nRKO\n\nFor a period of time in the 1940s to late 1950s, Hughes Tool Company ventured into the film and media industry where it then owned the RKO companies, including: RKO Pictures; RKO Studios; RKO Theatres, a chain of movie theatres; the RKO Radio Network, a network of radio stations.\n\nIn 1948, Hughes gained control of RKO, a struggling major Hollywood studio, by acquiring 25 percent of the outstanding stock from Floyd Odlum's Atlas Corporation. Within weeks of taking control, he dismissed three-quarters of the work force, and production was shut down for six months in 1949 while he undertook the investigation of the politics of all remaining studio employees. Completed pictures would be sent back for re-shooting if he felt that his star (especially female) was not properly presented, or if a film's anti-communist politics were not sufficiently clear. In 1952, an abortive sale to a Chicago-based group with no experience in the industry disrupted studio operations even further.\n\nHughes sold the RKO theaters in 1953 as settlement of the United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. antitrust case. With the sale of the profitable theaters, the shaky status of the film studio became increasingly apparent. A steady stream of lawsuits from RKO's minority shareholders became an increasing nuisance, charging him with financial misconduct and corporate mismanagement, especially because Hughes wanted to focus on his aircraft-manufacturing and TWA holdings during the Korean War years. Eager to be rid of the distraction, Hughes offered to buy out all other stockholders.\n\nHe had gained near-total control of RKO by the end of 1954, at a cost of nearly $24 million, becoming the closest thing to a sole owner of a Hollywood studio seen in three decades. Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25 million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in motion pictures; his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During this time period RKO became home to numerous film noir classic productions, due to in part to the limited budgets required to such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5 million in personal profit. \n\nGeneral Tire was interested mainly in exploiting the value of the RKO library for television programming, though it made some attempts to continue producing films. After a year and a half of mixed success, General Tire shut down film production at RKO for good at the end of January 1957. The studio lots in Hollywood and Culver City were sold to Desilu Productions later that year for $6.15 million.\n\nReal estate\n\nBeyond extending his business prowess in the manufacturing, aviation, entertainment, and hospitality industries, Hughes was a successful real estate investor. Hughes was deeply involved in the American real estate industry where he amassed vast holdings of undeveloped land both in Las Vegas and in the desert surrounding the city that had gone unused during his lifetime. In 1968, the Hughes Tool Company purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal.\n\nOriginally known as Summa Corporation, The Howard Hughes Corporation was formed in 1972 when the oil tools business of Hughes Tool Company, then owned by Howard Hughes, Jr., was floated on the New York Stock Exchange under the Hughes Tool name. This forced the remaining businesses of the \"original\" Hughes Tool to adopt a new corporate name Summa. The name \"Summa\"Latin for \"highest\"was adopted without the approval of Hughes himself, who preferred to keep his own name on the business, and suggested HRH Properties (for Hughes Resorts and Hotels, and also his own initials).\n\nInitially staying in the Desert Inn, Hughes refused to vacate his room, and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels and media outlets, spending an estimated $300 million, and using his considerable powers to take-over many of the well known hotels, especially the organized crime connected venues. He quickly became one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the image of Las Vegas from its Wild West roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city.\n\nTechnology\n\nAnother portion of Hughes' business interests lay in aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries. Hughes was a lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot. At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including Moye Stephens. He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading Hughes Aircraft at the airport in Glendale, CA. Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the Hughes H-1 Racer. On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane airspeed record of 352 mph over his test course near Santa Ana, California (Giuseppe Motta reached 362 mph in 1929 and George Stainforth reached 407.5 mph in 1931, both in seaplanes). This was the last time in history that the world airspeed record was set in an aircraft built by a private individual. A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new transcontinental airspeed record by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in 7 hours, 28 minutes and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of 9 hours, 27 minutes). His average ground speed over the flight was 322 mph. \n\nThe H-1 Racer featured a number of design innovations: it had retractable landing gear (as Boeing Monomail had five years before) and all rivets and joints set flush into the body of the aircraft to reduce drag. The H-1 Racer is thought to have influenced the design of a number of World War II fighters such as the Mitsubishi Zero, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and the F8F Bearcat;  although that has never been reliably confirmed. The H-1 Racer was donated to the Smithsonian in 1975 and is on display at the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nRound-the-world flight\n\nOn July 14, 1938, Hughes set another record by completing a flight around the world in just 91 hours (3 days, 19 hours, 17 minutes), beating the previous record set in 1933 by Wiley Post in a single engine Lockheed Vega by almost four days. Hughes returned home ahead of photographs of his flight. Taking off from New York City, Hughes continued to Paris, Moscow, Omsk, Yakutsk, Fairbanks, Minneapolis, then returning to New York City. For this flight he flew a Lockheed 14 Super Electra (NX18973, a twin-engine transport with a four-man crew) fitted with the latest radio and navigational equipment. Hughes wanted the flight to be a triumph of American aviation technology, illustrating that safe, long-distance air travel was possible. While he had previously been relatively obscure despite his wealth, being better known for dating Katharine Hepburn, New York City now gave Hughes a ticker-tape parade in the Canyon of Heroes.  In 1938, the William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas—known at the time as Houston Municipal Airport—was renamed after Hughes, but the name was changed back after people objected to naming the airport after a living person. Originally from Mystic, Iowa, Albert I Lodwick provided excellent organizational skills as his flight operations manager which directly contributed to Hughes' record breaking flight. \n\nHughes also had a role in the design and financing of both the Boeing 307 Stratoliner and Lockheed L-049 Constellation. \n\nHe received many awards as an aviator, including the Harmon Trophy in 1936 and 1938, the Collier Trophy and the Bibesco Cup of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale in 1938, the Octave Chanute Award in 1940, and a special Congressional Gold Medal in 1939 \"in recognition of the achievements of Howard Hughes in advancing the science of aviation and thus bringing great credit to his country throughout the world\". According to his obituary in the New York Times, Hughes never bothered to come to Washington to pick up the Congressional Gold Medal, which was eventually mailed to him.\n\nHughes D-2 and XF-11\n\nThe Hughes D-2 was conceived in 1939 as a bomber with five crew members, powered by 42-cylinder Wright R-2160 Tornado engines. In the end it appeared as two-seat fighter-reconnaissance aircraft designated the D-2A, powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-2800-49 engines. The aircraft was constructed using the Duramold process. The prototype was brought to Harper's Dry Lake California in great secrecy in 1943 and first flew on June 20 of that year.  Acting on a recommendation of the president's son, Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, who had become friends with Hughes, in September 1943 the USAAF ordered 100 of a reconnaissance development of the D-2, known as the F-11. Hughes then attempted to get the military to pay for the development of the D-2. In November 1944, the hangar containing the D-2A was reportedly hit by lightning and the aircraft was destroyed. The D-2 design was abandoned, but led to the extremely controversial Hughes XF-11. The XF-11 was a large all-metal, two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-4360-31 engines, each driving a set of contra-rotating propellers. Only the two prototypes were completed; the second one with a single propeller per side. \n\nNear-fatal crash of the Sikorsky S-43\n\nIn the spring of 1943 Hughes spent nearly a month in Las Vegas, test flying his Sikorsky S-43 amphibian aircraft, practicing touch-and-go landings on Lake Mead in preparation for flying the H-4 Hercules. The weather conditions at the lake during the day were ideal and he enjoyed Las Vegas at night. On May 17, 1943, Hughes flew the Sikorsky from California carrying two CAA aviation inspectors, two of his employees and actress Ava Gardner. Hughes dropped Gardner off in Las Vegas and proceeded to Lake Mead to conduct qualifying tests in the S-43. The test flight did not go well. The Sikorsky crashed into Lake Mead, killing CAA inspector Ceco Cline and Hughes employee Richard Felt. Hughes suffered a severe gash on the top of his head when he hit the upper control panel and had to be rescued by one of the others on board.  Hughes paid divers $100,000 to raise the aircraft and later spent more than $500,000 restoring the aircraft. \n\nNear-fatal crash of the XF-11\n\nHughes was involved in a near-fatal aircraft accident on July 7, 1946, while performing the first flight of the prototype U.S. Army Air Forces reconnaissance aircraft, the XF-11, near Hughes airfield at Culver City, California. An oil leak caused one of the contra-rotating propellers to reverse pitch, causing the aircraft to yaw sharply and lose altitude rapidly. Hughes attempted to save the aircraft by landing it at the Los Angeles Country Club golf course, but just seconds before reaching the course, the XF-11 started to drop dramatically and crashed in the Beverly Hills neighborhood surrounding the country club.  \n\nWhen the XF-11 finally came to a halt after destroying three houses, the fuel tanks exploded, setting fire to the aircraft and a nearby home at 808 North Whittier Drive, owned by Lt Col. Charles E. Meyer.  Hughes managed to pull himself out of the flaming wreckage but lay beside the aircraft until he was rescued by Marine Master Sgt. William L. Durkin, who happened to be in the area visiting friends.  Hughes sustained significant injuries in the crash, including a crushed collar bone, multiple cracked ribs,  crushed chest with collapsed left lung, shifting his heart to the right side of the chest cavity, and numerous third-degree burns. An oft-told story said that Hughes sent a check to the Marine weekly for the remainder of his life as a sign of gratitude. However, Durkin's daughter denied that he took any money for the rescue. \n\nDespite his physical injuries, Hughes was proud that his mind was still working. As he lay in his hospital bed, he decided that he did not like the bed's design. He called in plant engineers to design a customized bed, equipped with hot and cold running water, built in six sections, and operated by 30 electric motors, with push-button adjustments.  The hospital bed was designed by Hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries. Despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed, Hughes' bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed.  Hughes' doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous. Hughes, however, believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery, instead asserting the natural life-giving properties of fresh squeezed orange juice were responsible.\n\nMany attribute his long-term dependence on opiates to his use of codeine as a painkiller during his convalescence. The trademark mustache he wore afterward was used to hide a scar on his upper lip resulting from the accident. \n\nH-4 Hercules\n\nThe War Production Board (not the military) originally contracted with Henry Kaiser and Hughes to produce the gigantic HK-1 Hercules flying boat for use during World War II to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic as an alternative to seagoing troop transport ships that were vulnerable to German U-boats. The project was opposed by the military services, thinking it would siphon resources from higher priority programs, but was advocated by Hughes' powerful allies in Washington, D.C. After disputes, Kaiser withdrew from the project and Hughes elected to continue it as the H-4 Hercules. However, the aircraft was not completed until after the end of World War II.  \n\nThe Hercules was the world's largest flying boat, the largest aircraft made from wood,  and, at 319 ft, had the longest wingspan of any aircraft (the next largest wingspan was about 310 ft). (The Hercules is no longer the longest or heaviest aircraft ever built; both of those titles are currently held by the Antonov An-225 Mriya.)\n\nThe Hercules flew only once for one mile (1.6 km), and 70 ft above the water, with Hughes at the controls, on November 2, 1947. \n\nThe Hercules was nicknamed the \"Spruce Goose\" by critics, but was actually made largely from birch (not spruce), rather than of aluminum, because the contract required that Hughes build the aircraft of non-strategic materials. It was built in Hughes' Westchester, California facility. In 1947, Howard Hughes was summoned to testify before the Senate War Investigating Committee to explain why the H-4 development had been so troubled, and why the F-11 had resulted in only two prototypes after $22 million spent. General Elliott Roosevelt and numerous other USAAF officers were also called to testify in hearings that transfixed the nation during August and again in November 1947. In a hotly disputed testimony over TWA's route awards and malfeasance in the defense acquisition process, Hughes turned the tables on his main interlocutor, Maine Senator Owen Brewster, and the hearings were widely interpreted as a Hughes victory. After display at the Long Beach, California harbor, the Hercules was moved to McMinnville, Oregon, where it is now part of the Evergreen Aviation Museum. \n\nHughes Aircraft\n\nHughes Aircraft Company, a division of Hughes Tool Company, was originally founded by Hughes in 1932, in a rented corner of a Lockheed Aircraft Corporation hangar in Burbank, California, to build the H-1 racer. During and after World War II, Hughes fashioned his company into a major defense contractor. The Hughes Helicopters division started in 1947 when helicopter manufacturer Kellett sold their latest design to Hughes for production. The company was a major American aerospace and defense contractor manufacturing numerous technology related products that include spacecraft vehicles, military aircraft, radar systems, electro-optical systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), commercial satellites, and other electronics systems.\n\nIn 1948, Hughes created a new division of the company, the Hughes Aerospace Group. The Hughes Space and Communications Group and the Hughes Space Systems Division were later spun off in 1948 to form their own divisions and ultimately became the Hughes Space and Communications Company in 1961. In 1953, Howard Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a tax-exempt charitable organization. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion. In 1997, General Motors sold Hughes Aircraft to Raytheon and in 2000, sold Hughes Space & Communications to Boeing. A combination of Boeing, GM and Raytheon acquired the Hughes Research Laboratories, where it focused on advanced developments in microelectronics, information & systems sciences, materials, sensors, and photonics; their workspace spans from basic research to product delivery. It has particularly emphasized capabilities in high performance integrated circuits, high power lasers, antennas, networking, and smart materials.\n\nAirlines\n\nIn 1939, at the urging of Jack Frye, president of Trans World Airlines (TWA), Hughes quietly purchased a majority share of TWA stock for nearly $7 million and took control of the airline. Upon assuming ownership, Hughes was prohibited by federal law from building his own aircraft. Seeking an aircraft that would perform better than TWA's fleet of Boeing 307 Stratoliners, Hughes and Frye approached Boeing's competitor, Lockheed. Hughes had a good relationship with Lockheed since they had built the aircraft he used in his record flight around the world in 1938. Lockheed agreed to Hughes and Frye's request that the new aircraft be built in secrecy. The result was the revolutionary Constellation and TWA purchased the first 40 of the new airliners off the production line.\n\nIn 1956, Hughes placed an order for 63 Convair 880s for TWA at a cost of $400 million. Although Hughes was extremely wealthy at this time, outside creditors demanded that Hughes relinquish control of TWA in return for providing the money. In 1960, Hughes was ultimately forced out of TWA, although he owned 78% of the company and battled to regain control.\n\nBefore Hughes' removal, the TWA jet financing issue precipitated the end of Hughes' relationship with Noah Dietrich. Dietrich claimed Hughes developed a plan by which Hughes Tool Company profits would be inflated to sell the company for a windfall that would pay the bills for the 880s. Dietrich agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan on the condition that Hughes agreed to a capital gains arrangement he had long promised Dietrich. When Hughes balked, Dietrich resigned immediately. \"Noah\", Dietrich quoted Hughes as replying, \"I cannot exist without you!\" Dietrich stood firm and eventually had to sue to retrieve personal possessions from his office after Hughes ordered it locked.\n\nIn 1966, a U.S. federal court forced Hughes to sell his TWA shares because of concerns over conflict of interest between his ownership of both TWA and Hughes Aircraft. The sale of his TWA shares netted him a profit of $547 million.\n\nIn 1970, Hughes went back into the airline business, buying San Francisco-based Air West and renaming it Hughes Airwest. Air West had been formed in 1968 by the merger of Bonanza Air Lines, Pacific Air Lines and West Coast Airlines, all of which operated in the western U.S.  By the late 1970s, Hughes Airwest operated an all-jet fleet of Boeing 727-200, Douglas DC-9-10, and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners serving an extensive route network in the western U.S. with flights to Mexico and western Canada as well.    By 1980, the airline's route system reached as far east as Houston Hobby Airport and Milwaukee with a total of forty-two (42) destinations being served.   Hughes Airwest was then acquired by and merged into Republic Airlines (1979–1986) in late 1980. Republic was subsequently acquired by and merged into Northwest Airlines which in turn was eventually merged into Delta Air Lines.\n\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute\n\nIn 1953, Hughes launched the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Miami, Florida, and currently located in Chevy Chase, Maryland, formed with the expressed goal of basic biomedical research, including trying to understand, in Hughes' words, the \"genesis of life itself\", due to his lifelong interest in science and technology. Hughes' first will, which he signed in 1925 at the age of 19, stipulated that a portion of his estate should be used to create a medical institute bearing his name.   When a major battle with the IRS loomed ahead, Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a for-profit entity of a fully tax-exempt charity. Hughes' internist, Verne Mason, who treated Hughes after his 1946 aircraft crash, was chairman of the institute's medical advisory committee.  The Howard Hughes Medical Institute's new board of trustees sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion, allowing the institute to grow dramatically.\n\nThe deal was the topic of a protracted legal battle between Hughes and the Internal Revenue Service, which Hughes ultimately won. After his death in 1976, many thought that the balance of Hughes' estate would go to the institute, although it was ultimately divided among his cousins and other heirs, given the lack of a will to the contrary. The HHMI was the 4th largest private organization as of 2007 and the largest devoted to biological and medical research, with an endowment of $16.3 billion as of June 2007. \n\nGlomar Explorer\n\nIn 1972, Hughes was approached by the CIA to help secretly recover Soviet submarine K-129, which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier. The recovery plan used the special-purpose salvage vessel Glomar Explorer. Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, having to do with civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules. In the summer of 1974, Glomar Explorer attempted to raise the Soviet vessel. \n\nHowever, during the recovery a mechanical failure in the ship's grapple caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor. This section is believed to have held many of the most sought-after items, including its code book and nuclear missiles. Two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered, along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony. The operation, known as Project Azorian (but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer), became public in February 1975 after secret documents were released, obtained by burglars from Hughes' headquarters in June 1974.  Though he lent his name to the operation, Hughes and his companies had no actual involvement in the project.  The Glomar Explorer was eventually acquired by Transocean Inc., an offshore oil and gas drilling rig company.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1929 Hughes' wife, Ella, returned to Houston and filed for divorce. Hughes dated many famous women, many of them decades younger, including Billie Dove, Faith Domergue, Bette Davis, Ava Gardner, Olivia de Havilland, Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Rita Hayworth and Gene Tierney. He also proposed to Joan Fontaine several times, according to her autobiography No Bed of Roses. Jean Harlow accompanied him to the premiere of Hell's Angels, but Noah Dietrich wrote many years later that the relationship was strictly professional, as Hughes apparently personally disliked Harlow. In his 1971 book, Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes, Dietrich said that Hughes genuinely liked and respected Jane Russell, but never sought romantic involvement with her. According to Russell's autobiography, however, Hughes once tried to bed her after a party. Russell (who was married at the time) refused him, and Hughes promised it would never happen again. The two maintained a professional and private friendship for many years. Hughes remained good friends with Tierney who, after his failed attempts to seduce her, was quoted as saying \"I don't think Howard could love anything that did not have a motor in it.\"  Later, when Tierney's daughter Daria was born deaf and blind and with a severe learning disability, because of Tierney's being exposed to rubella during her pregnancy, Hughes saw to it that Daria received the best medical care and paid all expenses. \n\nIn 1933, Hughes purchased unseen the Rover, a luxury steam yacht previously owned by British shipping magnate Lord Inchcape. \"I have never seen the Rover but bought it on the blue prints, photographs and the reports of Lloyd's surveyors. My experience is that the English are the most honest race in the world.\"  Hughes renamed the yacht Southern Cross and later sold her to Swedish entrepreneur Axel Wenner-Gren. \n\nOn July 11, 1936, Hughes struck and killed a pedestrian named Gabriel S. Meyer with his car, at the corner of 3rd Street and Lorraine in Los Angeles.  Hughes was certified as sober at the hospital he was taken to after the accident, but an attending doctor made a note that Hughes had been drinking. A witness to the accident told police that Hughes was driving erratically and too fast, and that Meyer had been standing in the safety zone of a streetcar stop. Hughes was booked on suspicion of negligent homicide and held overnight in jail until his attorney, Neil McCarthy, obtained a writ of habeas corpus for his release pending a coroner's inquest.   By the time of the coroner's inquiry, however, the witness had changed his story and claimed that Meyer had moved directly in front of Hughes' car. Nancy Bayly (Watts), who was in the car with Hughes at the time of the accident, corroborates this version. On July 16, 1936, Hughes was held blameless by a coroner's jury at the inquest into Meyer's death.  Hughes told reporters outside the inquiry, \"I was driving slowly and a man stepped out of the darkness in front of me.\"\n\nOn January 12, 1957, Hughes married actress Jean Peters. The couple met in the 1940s, before Peters became a film actress.  They had a highly publicized romance in 1947 and there was talk of marriage, but she said she could not combine it with her career.  Some later claimed that Peters was \"the only woman [Hughes] ever loved\",  and he reportedly had his security officers follow her everywhere even when they were not in a relationship. Such reports were confirmed by actor Max Showalter, who became a close friend of Peters while shooting Niagara (1953).  Showalter told in an interview that because he frequently met with Peters, Hughes' men threatened to ruin his career if he did not leave her alone.\n\nNixon scandal\n\nShortly before the 1960 Presidential election, Richard Nixon was alarmed when it was revealed that his brother, Donald, received a $205,000 loan from Hughes. It has long been speculated that Nixon's drive to learn what the Democrats were planning in 1972 was based in part on his belief that the Democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend Bebe Rebozo had received from Hughes after Nixon took office.\n\nIn late 1971, Donald Nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election. One of Donald's sources was John H. Meier, a former business adviser of Hughes who had also worked with Democratic National Committee Chair Larry O'Brien. \n\nMeier, in collaboration with former Vice President of the United States Hubert Humphrey and others, wanted to feed misinformation to the Nixon campaign. Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because Larry O'Brien had a great deal of information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Howard Hughes that had never been released;   O'Brien didn't actually have any such information, but Meier wanted Nixon to think he did. Donald told his brother that O'Brien was in possession of damaging Hughes information that could destroy his campaign.  Terry Lenzner, who was the chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, speculates that it was Nixon's desire to know what O'Brien knew about Nixon's dealings with Hughes that may have partially motivated the Watergate break-in. \n\nEccentricity and physical decline\n\nHughes was eccentric.  Close friends of Hughes reported that he was obsessed with the size of peas, one of his favorite foods, and used a special fork to sort them by size.\n\nWhile directing The Outlaw, Hughes became fixated on a small flaw in one of Jane Russell's blouses, claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast. He reportedly wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem. Richard Fleischer, who directed His Kind of Woman with Hughes as executive producer, wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty of dealing with the tycoon. In his book, Just Tell Me When to Cry, Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate. He also revealed that Hughes' unpredictable mood swings made him wonder if the film would ever be completed.\n\nIn 1947, after the U.S. Government rejected his massive H-4 Hercules, Hughes, who had suffered a near-fatal aircraft crash in 1946, told his aides that he wanted to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened screening room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk, later urinating in the empty bottles and containers. He was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the spring of 1948, his hygiene was terrible. He had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks, although this may have been due to allodynia (pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain).\n\nAfter the screening room incident, Hughes moved into a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides, his wife, and numerous girlfriends. He would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals, watching movies. This may have been because Hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to his allodynia. He may have watched movies to distract him from his pain—a common practice among patients with intractable pain, especially those who do not receive adequate treatment. In one year, Hughes spent an estimated $11 million at the hotel.\n\nHughes began purchasing all restaurant chains and four star hotels that had been founded within the state of Texas. This included, if for only a short period, many unknown franchises currently out of business. He placed ownership of the restaurants with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and all licenses were resold shortly after.\n\nAnother time, he became obsessed with the 1968 film Ice Station Zebra, and had it run on a continuous loop in his home. According to his aides, he watched it 150 times.   \n\nHughes insisted on using tissues to pick up objects to insulate himself from germs. He would also notice dust, stains or other imperfections on people's clothes and demand that they take care of them. Once one of the most visible men in America, Hughes ultimately vanished from public view—though tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts. He was reported to be terminally ill, mentally unstable, or even dead.\n\nInjuries from numerous aircraft crashes caused Hughes to spend much of his later life in pain, and he eventually became addicted to codeine, which he injected intramuscularly. Hughes had his hair cut and nails trimmed only once a year, likely due to the pain caused by the RSD/CRPS, which was caused by the plane crashes.\n\nLater years as a Las Vegas recluse\n\nThe wealthy and aging Howard Hughes, accompanied by his entourage of personal aides, began moving from one hotel to another, always taking up residence in the top floor penthouse. In the last ten years of his life, 1966 to 1976, Hughes lived in hotels in many cities—including Beverly Hills, Boston, Las Vegas, Nassau, Freeport, Vancouver,  London, Managua, and Acapulco.\n\nOn November 24, 1966 (Thanksgiving Day),Levitan, Corey. [http://www.lvrj.com/living/16160347.html \"Top 10 Scandals: Gritty City.\"] Las Vegas Review-Journal. Retrieved: March 3, 2008. Hughes arrived in Las Vegas by railroad car and moved into the Desert Inn. Because he refused to leave the hotel, and to avoid further conflicts with the owners, Hughes bought the Desert Inn in early 1967. The hotel's eighth floor became the nerve center of Hughes' empire and the ninth-floor penthouse became his personal residence. Between 1966 and 1968, he bought several other hotel-casinos—including the Castaways, New Frontier, the Landmark Hotel and Casino, and the Sands.  He bought the small Silver Slipper casino just so he could have its trademark neon silver slipper moved. Visible from Hughes' bedroom, it apparently had kept him up at night.\n\nAfter Hughes left the Desert Inn, hotel employees discovered his drapes had not been opened in the nine years he lived there, and had rotted through.  An unusual incident marked an earlier Hughes connection to Las Vegas: during his 1954 engagement at the Last Frontier hotel in Las Vegas, flamboyant entertainer Liberace mistook Howard Hughes for his lighting director, instructing him to instantly bring up a blue light should he start to play Clair de lune. Hughes nodded in compliance—but the hotel's entertainment director arrived and introduced Hughes to Liberace. \n\nHughes wanted to change the image of Las Vegas to something more glamorous. As Hughes wrote in a memo to an aide, \"I like to think of Las Vegas in terms of a well-dressed man in a dinner jacket and a beautifully jeweled and furred female getting out of an expensive car.\" Hughes bought several local television stations (including KLAS-TV).\n\nHughes' considerable business holdings were overseen by a small panel unofficially dubbed \"The Mormon Mafia\" because of the many Latter-day Saints on the committee, led by Frank William Gay.   In addition to supervising day-to-day business operations and Hughes' health, they also went to great pains to satisfy Hughes' every whim. Hughes once became fond of Baskin-Robbins' banana nut ice cream, so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him—only to discover that Baskin-Robbins had discontinued the flavor. They put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order, 200 gallons (750 L), and had it shipped from Los Angeles. A few days after the order arrived, Hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only chocolate marshmallow ice cream. The Desert Inn ended up distributing free banana nut ice cream to casino customers for a year.  In a 1996 interview, ex–Howard Hughes communicator Robert Maheu said, \"There is a rumor that there is still some banana nut ice cream left in the freezer. It is most likely true.\"\n\nAs an owner of several major Las Vegas businesses, Hughes wielded much political and economic influence in Nevada and elsewhere. During the 1960s and early 1970s, he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site. Hughes was concerned about the risk from residual nuclear radiation, and attempted to halt the tests. When the tests finally went through despite Hughes' efforts, the detonations were powerful enough that the entire hotel where he was staying trembled with the shock waves.  In two separate, last-ditch maneuvers, Hughes instructed his representatives to offer million-dollar bribes to both presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon. \n\nIn 1970, Jean Peters filed for divorce. The two had not lived together for many years. Peters requested a lifetime alimony payment of $70,000 a year, adjusted for inflation, and waived all claims to Hughes' estate. Hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars, but she declined it. Hughes did not insist on a confidentiality agreement from Peters as a condition of the divorce. Aides reported that Hughes never spoke ill of her. She refused to discuss her life with Hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers. Peters would state only that she had not seen Hughes for several years before their divorce and had only dealt with him by phone.\n\nHughes was living in the Intercontinental Hotel near Lake Managua in Nicaragua, seeking privacy and security,  when a magnitude 6.5 earthquake damaged Managua in December 1972. As a precaution, Hughes moved to the Nicaraguan National Palace and stayed there as a guest of Anastasio Somoza Debayle before leaving for Florida on a private jet the following day.  He subsequently moved into the Penthouse at the Xanadu Princess Resort on Grand Bahama Island, which he had recently purchased. He lived almost exclusively in the penthouse of the Xanadu Beach Resort & Marina for the last four years of his life. Hughes had spent a total of $300 million on his many properties in Las Vegas.\n\nMemoir hoax\n\nIn 1972, author Clifford Irving caused a media sensation when he claimed he had co-written an authorized autobiography of Hughes. Hughes was so reclusive that he did not immediately publicly refute Irving's statement, leading many to believe the Irving book was genuine. However, before the book's publication Hughes finally denounced Irving in a teleconference and the entire project was eventually exposed as a hoax.  Irving was later convicted of fraud and spent 17 months in prison. In 1974, the Orson Welles film F for Fake included a section on the Hughes biography hoax. In 1977, The Hoax by Clifford Irving was published in the United Kingdom, telling his story of these events. The 2006 film The Hoax, starring Richard Gere, is also based on these events. \n\nDeath\n\nHughes was reported to have died on April 5, 1976, at 1:27 p.m. on board an aircraft owned by Robert Graf and piloted by Jeff Abrams. He was en route from his penthouse at the Acapulco Fairmont Princess Hotel in Mexico to the Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas. Other accounts indicate that he died on the flight from Freeport, Grand Bahama, to Houston. \n\nAfter receiving a call, his senior counsel, Frank P. Morse, ordered his staff to get his body on a plane and return him to the United States. It was common that foreign countries would hold a corpse as ransom so that an estate could not be settled. Morse ordered the pilots to announce Hughes' death once they entered U.S. airspace. \n\nHis reclusive activities (and possibly his drug use) made him practically unrecognizable. His hair, beard, fingernails, and toenails were long—his tall 6 ft frame now weighed barely 90 lb, and the FBI had to use fingerprints to conclusively identify the body.  Howard Hughes' alias, John T. Conover, was used when his body arrived at a morgue in Houston on the day of his death. There, his body was received by Dr. Jack Titus. \n\nA subsequent autopsy recorded kidney failure as the cause of death.  Hughes was in extremely poor physical condition at the time of his death. He suffered from malnutrition. While his kidneys were damaged, his other internal organs, including his brain, were deemed perfectly healthy. X-rays revealed five broken-off hypodermic needles in the flesh of his arms. To inject codeine into his muscles, Hughes had used glass syringes with metal needles that easily became detached.\n\nHughes is buried in the Glenwood Cemetery in Houston, Texas, next to his parents. \n\nThe red brick house where Hughes lived as a teenager at 3921 Yoakum St., Houston today serves as the headquarters of the Theology Department of the University of St. Thomas.\n\nEstate\n\nApproximately three weeks after Hughes' death, a handwritten will was found on the desk of an official of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Salt Lake City. The so-called \"Mormon Will\" gave $1.56 billion to various charitable organizations (including $625 million to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute); nearly $470 million to the upper management in Hughes' companies and to his aides; $156 million to first cousin William Lummis; and $156 million split equally between his two ex-wives Ella Rice and Jean Peters.\n\nHughes left his entire estate, in his last will, and according to his senior counsel (Frank P. Morse), to the Hughes Medical Institute, as he had no connection to family and was seriously ill. This is contrary to the many wills that have surfaced after his death. The original will, that included payments to aides, never surfaced, and was apparently in a home surrounding the Desert Inn Golf Course, belonging to the mother of an assistant. He had no desire to leave any money to family, aides, churches, including William Gay and Frank Morse.  Hughes was not Mormon and had no reason to leave his estate to that church. Frank P. Morse is still the attorney of record for Hughes. Gay has devoted his life to the Mormon Church.\n\nA further $156 million was endowed to a gas-station owner named Melvin Dummar, who told reporters that late one evening in December 1967, he found a disheveled and dirty man lying along U.S. Highway 95, 150 mi north of Las Vegas. The man asked for a ride to Las Vegas. Dropping him off at the Sands Hotel, Dummar said the man told him he was Hughes. Dummar then claimed that days after Hughes' death, a \"mysterious man\" appeared at his gas station, leaving an envelope containing the will on his desk. Unsure if the will was genuine, and unsure of what to do, Dummar left the will at the LDS Church office. In June 1978, after a seven-month trial, a Nevada court rejected the Mormon Will as a forgery, and declared that Hughes had died intestate. Jonathan Demme's 1980 film Melvin and Howard, written by Bo Goldman and starring Jason Robards and Paul Le Mat, was based on Dummar's story.\n\nHughes' $2.5 billion estate was eventually split in 1983 among 22 cousins, including William Lummis, who serves as a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Hughes Aircraft was owned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which sold it to General Motors in 1985 for $5.2 billion. The court rejected suits by the states of California and Texas that claimed they were owed inheritance tax. In 1984, Hughes' estate paid an undisclosed amount to Terry Moore, who claimed she and Hughes had secretly married on a yacht in international waters off Mexico in 1949, and never divorced. Moore never produced proof of a marriage, but her book, The Beauty and the Billionaire, became a bestseller.\n\nAwards\n\n*Congressional Gold Medal (presented August 7, 1939)\n*National Aviation Hall of Fame (inducted 1973)\n\nArchive\n\nThe moving image collection of Howard Hughes is held at the Academy Film Archive. The collection consists of over 200 items including 35mm and 16mm elements of feature films, documentaries, and television programs made or accumulated by Hughes. \n\nPopular culture\n\nHoward Hughes has now emerged as one of the 20th century's most iconic business and aviation figures, spawning a wide range of cultural references.\n\nFilm\n\n(Chronological)\n*The Carpetbaggers (1964) George Peppard plays a hard-driven industrialist more than a little reminiscent of Howard Hughes.\n*Willard Whyte, a billionaire from the 1971 James Bond film, Diamonds Are Forever, is based on Howard Hughes. Hughes, a friend of producer Albert Broccoli, let his hotel and casino be used in the filming.  It was Hughes' Las Vegas Hilton that doubled for the \"Whyte House\".\n* The Amazing Howard Hughes (1977), directed by William A. Graham, with Tommy Lee Jones as Howard Hughes, from ages 18 to 70.\n* Melvin and Howard (1980), directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jason Robards (a distant cousin) as Howard Hughes and Paul Le Mat as Melvin Dummar. The film won Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay (Bo Goldman) and Best Supporting Actress (Mary Steenburgen). The film focuses on Melvin Dummar's claims of meeting Hughes in the Nevada desert and subsequent estate battles over his inclusion in Hughes' will. Critic Pauline Kael called the film \"an almost flawless act of sympathetic imagination\". \n* Portrayed by Dean Stockwell in Tucker (1988).\n* Hughes was portrayed by Terry O'Quinn in Disney's The Rocketeer (1991), substituting for the \"mystery inventor\" (Doc Savage) in the original comic book version.\n* \"Howard Hughes Documentary\", broadcast in 1992 as an episode of the Time Machine documentary series, was introduced by Peter Graves, later released by A&E Home Video. \n* Before The Aviator (2004), there were several attempts to create a biopic based on the life of Hughes. For years, director-actor Warren Beatty wanted to play Hughes and direct a big-screen film of the mogul. It was to be released alongside Beatty's film Reds, but owing to the lack of the right script, the project was abandoned. However, in 2016, Beatty will play as Hughes with an ensemble cast in Rules Don't Apply in which he also directed. Set during the later part of Hughes' life, the film is about a love affair between a younger woman and the reclusive billionaire.\n* In the 1990s, producers with Touchstone Pictures wanted to do it with John Malkovich, Edward Norton, or Johnny Depp as Hughes, but because of climbing costs that venture was abandoned. Castle Rock Entertainment also tried to develop a biopic called Mr. Hughes with Jim Carrey starring and with Christopher Nolan directing and re-writing a script originated by David Koepp and Brian De Palma. When The Aviator began production, the idea was scrapped, and Nolan went on to direct Batman Begins. Some of the details of Hughes as an adult were confirmed in A. Scott Berg's memoir of Katharine Hepburn, Kate Remembered.\n* The Aviator (2004), directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, and winning five, the acclaimed film focuses primarily on Hughes' achievements in aviation and in the movies and on the increasing handicaps imposed on him by his obsessive–compulsive behavior, and ends shortly after the successful flight of the Hercules in 1947.\n* Howard Hughes: The Real Aviator documentary was broadcast in 2004, and went on to win the Grand Festival Award for Best Documentary at the 2004 Berkeley Video & Film Festival. \n* The American Aviator: The Howard Hughes Story was broadcast in 2006 on the Biography Channel. It was later released to home media as a DVD with a copy of the full-length film The Outlaw starring Jane Russell. \n* Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), as a plot-related prequel to Iron Man 2 (2010), in which Howard Stark (played by Dominic Cooper), father of Tony Stark (Iron Man), showed his inventions of future technology, clearly picturing Hughes' persona and enthusiasm.  His subsequent appearances in the TV series Marvel's Agent Carter further this persona, as well as depicting him as sharing the real Hughes' reputation as a womanizer.  Stan Lee has noted that Tony, who shared several of these traits himself, was based on Hughes. \n\nTelevision\n\n*In The Simpsons episode \"$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)\", Mr. Burns refuses to leave his room after the opening of his casino and develops a paranoid obsession with germs and cleanliness; his hair and nails become unkempt, all of which parody Hughes' later life. He also makes a small model airplane called the Spruce Moose (a reference to Hughes' Spruce Goose), which he believes is a real, flyable plane.\n* In the Beverly Hillbillies episode, The Clampett-Hewes Empire, Mr. Drysdale gets enthusiastic when he hears the news that Jed Clampett is going into the airport business with \"Howard Hughes\" and does everything he can to make \"Mr. Hughes\" as welcome as possible (even putting together a small girl chorus singing \"We Love You Howard Hughes\")...until he discovers to his chagrin the \"Howard Hughes\" Jed Clampett is partnering with is not the famous billionaire airplane aficionado; he's nothing but a plain old, impoverished, henpecked husband farmer whose last name is Hewes (H-E-W-E-S)!\n*In the episode \"Dreamland\" of Dark Skies, set in 1964, a germ-phobic Howard Hughes helps the main characters prevent the alien Hive from attacking Area 51 in Nevada. In the process Hughes is attacked by one of the Hive, the episode implying that this incident triggered his descent into paranoia and reclusiveness.\n*In the Phineas and Ferb episode, \"De Plane, De Plane!\" the title characters decide to build a plane bigger than the Spruce Goose, which was built by Hughes. They state that the wingspan of the Spruce Goose is \"319 feet, 11 inches\" and that their plane is \"320 feet even.\" The plane built by Phineas and Ferb does not beat Howard Hughes' record.\n\nGames\n\n* The character of Andrew Ryan in the 2007 video game, BioShock is loosely based on Hughes. Ryan is a billionaire industrialist in the Post-WW2 America who, seeking to avoid governments, religions and other 'parasitic' influences, ordered the secret construction of an underwater city, Rapture. Years later, when Ryan's vision for Rapture falls into dystopia, he hides himself away and uses armies of mutated humans, \"Splicers\",  and robots to defend himself and fight against those trying to take over his city, including the player-character.. \n*Robert House, a character in the 2010 video game, Fallout: New Vegas is based on Hughes. In the game's alternate US history, House was CEO and president of RobCo., the 21st century's leading manufacturer of computers and robotics. House uses his technology to try to protect Las Vegas during a catastrophic nuclear war in 2077 and partially succeeds. He later rebuilds the city and is still running it in 2281, when the game takes place. Many references are made in the game to the life of Hughes, including a family-owned tool company, a crashed plane in Lake Mead, and an in-game photo similar to the famous photo of Hughes standing before a Boeing P-12. In addition to this, if the player character chooses certain actions they will come in direct physical contact with House who resembles, in appearance, the descriptions of Hughes late in his life.\n*In L.A. Noire, Hughes makes an appearance presenting his Hercules H-4 aircraft in the game introduction. The H-4 is later a central plot piece of DLC Arson Case, \"Nicholson Electroplating\".  \n*In Team Fortress 2 a hat referencing him can be obtained, named Barnstormer, the description of which references his film career, his aeronautics past, and some of his obsessions. The class that uses this hat is also a reference, since it is the Engineer.\n\nLiterature\n\n*Howard Hughes appears as a character in Death and Honor (Putnam, 2008), W.E.B. Griffin's fictional account of the clandestine espionage activities of agents of the United States Office of Strategic Services (the \"OSS\") during World War II. In the novel, Hughes is portrayed as an unofficial intelligence community insider.\n* Howard Hughes also appears as a character in James Ellroy's L.A. Quartet and Underworld USA Trilogy. In the latter saga, Hughes is described as reclusive, eccentric and mentally disturbed. He plans to take over the mafia's casinos in Las Vegas to establish a \"germ-free environment\" for his residence.\n*Stan Lee has repeatedly stated he created the Marvel Comics character Iron Man's civilian persona, Tony Stark, drawing inspiration from Howard Hughes' colorful lifestyle and personality. Additionally, the first name of Stark's father is Howard. \n* Jonas Cord, primary character in the Harold Robbins novel, The Carpetbaggers, is a literary twin of Howard Hughes.\n* In the novel Jailbird by Kurt Vonnegut, the character Mary Kathleen O'Looney has several traits that were obviously modeled after Howard Hughes (living as a paranoid homeless person while simultaneously being immensely rich and the CEO of a huge corporation, her orders validated by her fingerprints only).\n*Howard Hughes is discussed in an essay by Joan Didion, \"7000 Romaine, Los Angeles 38\". The essay is included in the collection Slouching Towards Bethlehem.\n\nMusic\n\n*\"Howard Hughes' Blues\" is a song about Hughes by John Hartford; it is a track on Hartford's album Morning Bugle.\n*In the Jim Croce song \"Workin' at the Car Wash Blues\", the narrator refers to himself as \"an undiscovered Howard Hughes\".\n*Hughes is referenced in the 1975 hit single, 'Wall Street Shuffle' by the top-selling UK band, 10cc.\n*In the Stan Ridgway song \"I Wanna Be a Boss\", the narrator refers to himself as planning to be more famous than Hughes, including references to growing a long beard and watching Ice Station Zebra in the nude. \n*\"Howard\" is a song about Hughes by the rock band Bayside from their album Shudder\n*The album Thanks for the Ether by Rasputina (band) features the song \"Howard Hughes\" in which they reference his many eccentricities.\n* In the Teardrop Explodes song \"Reward\" written by Julian Cope and Alan Gill on the 1980 Kilimanjaro album there is a reference to Howard Hughes.\n* \"Howard Hughes Blues\" (unrelated to the John Hartford version) appears on the 2009 CD album La la haha by Pig with the face of a boy.

                "An underwire bra (also under wire bra, under-wire bra, or underwired bra) is a brassiere that utilizes a thin, semi-circular strip of rigid material fitted inside the brassiere fabric. The wire may be made of metal, plastic, or resin. It is sewn into the bra fabric and under each cup, from the center gore to under the wearer's armpit. The wire helps to lift, separate, shape, and support a woman's breasts. Many different brassiere designs incorporate an underwire, including shelf bras, demi bras, nursing bras, and bras built into other articles of clothing, such as  tank tops, dresses and swimsuits.\n\nThe concept of an underwire can be traced to an 1893 patent that describes a breast supporting device using a rigid plate under the breasts for stability. The modern underwire bra was designed in the 1930s, and gained widespread popularity by the 1950s. As of 2005, underwire bras were the largest and fastest growing segment of the bra market. A bra without an underwire is a softcup bra.\n\nUnderwire bras are occasionally linked to health conditions including breast pain, mastitis, and metal allergies. Women wearing an underwire bra have in a few rare instances been subjected to extra scrutiny when their bra set off metal detectors at security checkpoints in airports or prisons. There have been a few recorded incidents where the underwire deflected a bullet or other weapon that struck the woman's chest.\n\nHistory\n\nThe precursor to the underwire bra can be traced back to at least 1893, when New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent  for a \"breast supporter\". The breast supporter was described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern push-up bra designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard, or other stiff material, shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas, or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits, held in place and adjusted to a snug fit by shoulder straps that crossed the back, forming an X-shape. It was secured with hook-and-eye closures.  \n\nThe underwire bra design emerged and took hold in the United States starting in the 1930s. Helene Pons received a patent in 1931 for a brassiere design that incorporated an \"open-ended wire loop\" that laid flat against the chest, encircling the bottom and sides of each breast.  A 1932 patent describes a U-shaped piece of wire used between the cups to keep the breasts separated.  A patent issued in 1938 to Pauline Boris describes a \"breast support\" which used pieces of wire to entirely encircle each breast.  In 1940, Walter Emmett Williams was issued a patent which described a wire framework, shaped like a spiderweb, that encircles and covers each breast to provide support.  Although development of the underwire bra started in the 1930s,  it did not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s, when the end of World War II freed metal for domestic use.  \n\nIn the 1940s, Howard Hughes had an underwire push-up bra designed for Jane Russell to emphasize her breasts in The Outlaw. According to Russell, the \"ridiculous\" contraption was painful and she secretly wore her own bra during the movie. The brassiere is now in a Hollywood museum.\n\nWith the popularity and widespread use of the underwire bra that started during the 1950s, the underwire was incorporated into many bra designs, and underwire bras were built into other articles of clothing. By 1990, Norma Kamali had incorporated underwire bras into both one- and two-piece (bikini) swimsuits.  Scott Lucretia was granted a patent for a camisole with an integrated underwire bra in 1989. \n\nUnderwire bras accounted for 60% of the United Kingdom bra market in 2000   and 70% in 2005.  In 2001, 500 million bras were sold in the United States, of which approximately 70% (350 million) were underwire bras. As of 2005, underwire bras were the fastest growing segment of the market. \n\nUnderwire construction\n\nUnderwire bras are built with a semi-circular \"underwire\", \"bra wire\", or \"wire\" embedded in the wire channel that circles the bottom and sides of each cup. One end, or head element, of the underwire is close to the front and center of the bra, and the other close to the armhole. The underwire can be made of metal or molded plastic; most are metallic. Plastic underwire has a very small share of the market because it does not provide the same support and rigidity offered by metal underwire. A metallic underwire is a thin strip of metal, usually with a nylon coating at both ends. \nMetals used include steel \nand nickel titanium, a shape memory alloy.   According to underwire manufacturer  Industries of New York, which supplies underwire for bra makers such as Bali, Playtex, Vanity Fair, Victoria's Secret, Warner's, and other bra labels, about 70 percent of women who wear bras wear steel underwire bras.\n\nWhen the underwire breaks through the bra fabric, it can cause tremendous discomfort. Celebrity chef, television personality, and businesswoman Clarissa Dickson Wright only wears a bra on special occasions. At her 50th birthday party, she was dancing when she suddenly felt a \"terrifying pain in my chest.\" She initially thought she was having a heart attack. \"The pain got more and more intense. I staggered off and discovered I'd broken my underwired bra.\"\n\nBecause underwire can tear through cloth, most women hand-wash underwire bras or machine-wash them on a delicate cycle. Bra wash bags, usually zippered mesh pouches, can also be used to protect bras and prevent the underwire from separating from the bra during machine washing. \n\nRecent patents\n\nIn 2002,  Industries obtained a patent for an underwire design that includes a spring-loaded plastic cushion tip on one or both ends. The spring is designed to keep the wire from poking through the bra.  In 2008, Scott Dutton of Wales invented the \"Bra Angel\", a simple device to repair a bra when the underwire pops out of its channel. It is a barbed plastic cap that fits onto the end of the underwire, which is then inserted back into the bra and held in place by the barbs.  \n\nHealth\n\nUnderwire bras can rub and pinch the breast, causing skin irritation and breast pain, and the wire of a worn bra can protrude from the fabric and scrape or cut the skin.  When the fabric of worn bra exposes an underwire, skin contact with nickel and other metals may cause contact dermatitis in a few women.  \n\nEffect on lactation \n\nUnderwire bras, like other constrictive garments, may contribute to clogged milk ducts in lactating women.   Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that does not support the breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain.  For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.  \n\nDefibrillator use \n\nUse of an automated external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied.  In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, it is not likely unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator are very close to it.  \n\nTropical disease \n\nA medical report documented that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, can lead to severe furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the Tumbu fly. The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially along the length of the metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing. It is almost impossible when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire. \n\nLegal issues\n\nThe United States Transportation Security Administration recommends that women do not wear underwire bras because they can set off metal detectors.  Though most women travelers wear them without any problem, it can depend on the material of the underwire.\n\nTransportation security\n\nOn Sunday, 24 August 2008, film maker Nancy Kates set off a metal detector during security screening. She objected when the agent attempted to pat-down her breasts. She said she told the agent, \"'You can't treat me as a criminal for wearing a bra.\" A TSA supervisor told her she had to either submit to the pat-down search in a private room or not fly. Kates offered to take off her bra, which the TSA accepted. She went to the restroom, removed her bra, and walked through the airport and security screening braless. She said that a supervisor told her that underwire bras were the leading cause of metal detector false alarms.  \n\nIn August 2010, cancer survivor Cathy Bossi, an on-duty flight attendant for U.S. Airways, was passing through security screening at Charlotte Douglas International Airport on the way to her next flight. Due to the radiation involved, she reluctantly passed through a full-body scanner. \"The T.S.A. Agent told me to put my I.D. on my back,\" she said. \"When I got out of there the agent said because my I.D. was on my back, I had to go to a personal screening area.\" During what she described as an \"aggressive\" pat-down search, security screening personnel forced her to remove and show her prosthetic breast.  Their action violated TSA guidelines, which state that agents do not need to touch or inspect a mastectomy prosthetic. \n\nIn October, 2010, CNN employee Rosemary Fitzpatrick was subject to a personal search after her underwire bra set off a metal detector. The TSA security official applied an invasive \"hand-sliding inspection\" during which she \"ran her hands around her breasts, over her stomach, buttocks and her inner thighs, and even touched her most private areas.\"  Fitzpatrick said that she cried during the experience. \"I felt helpless, I felt violated, and I felt humiliated.\" \n\nIn response, Triumph International, a Swiss company, launched what it called a \"Frequent Flyer Bra\" in late 2001. The bra uses metal-free clasps and underwires made of resin instead of metal that are guaranteed to not set off metal detectors.    The bras were not available in the United States, and in 2004 a Canadian spokeswoman did not know whether they were still manufactured. \n\nCorrectional facility rules\n\nSome correctional facilities, like San Quentin State Prison, require visitors to either cut their bras and remove the underwire, or temporarily use a soft cup bra provided by the institution before being granted entry. The result can be embarrassment and consternation for unsuspecting visitors.  Other facilities require women to remove their underwire bras in a bathroom, pass through the metal detector, and return to the bathroom to put their bras back on. \n\nIn June 2010, attorney Britney Horstman was barred from visiting her client in the Federal Detention Center at Miami, Florida  when her underwire bra set off the metal detector. Although she reminded guards of a detention center memo that permitted female attorneys visiting clients to wear an underwire bra, the guard refused her entry. That memo existed as a result of an agreement negotiated by the Federal Public Defender's Office, which represents inmates held at the institution before trial. That agreement allows female lawyers entry if her underwire bra is detected by a metal-detecting wand. Horstman removed her bra in a bathroom and returned to the security checkpoint braless, but was then turned away because she did not meet the facility's dress code. Horstman had previously worn an underwire bra into the facility without problems. Warden Linda McGrew later promised the incident would not happen again.  \n\nAccidents and attacks\n\nThere have been several cases where the underwire from a bra has helped deflect bullets or other objects, saving the wearer's life.\nIn 1996, the underwire of a girl's bra helped save her life when she was impaled on a railing and, according to hospital personnel, the underwire from her bra probably helped deflect the spike from her heart.  There have been multiple incidents where bullets were deflected by the underwire of a woman's bra, either keeping her entirely from harm, or directing the bullet away from the heart to another part of the body. \nOne such incident occurred in 2004 when a stray bullet shot by a member of the Ghetto Boys hit the narrow metal wire in Helen Kelly's bra and was deflected away from her heart.  In 2008, a robbery victim was saved from being stabbed in the chest when the attacker's knife was caught and deflected by the underwire of her bra.",
                "Ernestine Jane Geraldine Russell (June 21, 1921 – February 28, 2011 ) was an American film actress, and was one of Hollywood's leading sex symbols in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nRussell moved from the Midwest to California, where she had her first film role in 1943 with The Outlaw. In 1947, Russell delved into music before returning to films. After starring in multiple films in the 1950s, Russell again returned to music while completing several other films in the 1960s. She starred in more than 20 films throughout her career.\n\nRussell married three times, adopted three children, and in 1955 founded the World Adoption International Fund. She received several accolades for her achievements in films, including having her hand- and footprints immortalized in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and having a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn on June 21, 1921, in Bemidji, Minnesota,  Russell was the eldest child and only daughter of the five children of Roy William Russell (January 5, 1890 – July 18, 1937) and Geraldine Jacobi (January 2, 1891 – December 26, 1986). Her brothers are Thomas (born 1924), Kenneth (born 1925), Jamie (born 1927), and Wallace (born 1929). \n\nHer father had been a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army, and her mother an actress with a road troupe. Later, the family moved to Southern California and her father worked as an office manager.\n\nRussell's mother arranged for her to take piano lessons. In addition to music, she was interested in drama and participated in stage productions at Van Nuys High School.  Her early ambition was to be a designer of some kind, until the death of her father in his mid-40s when she decided to work as a receptionist after graduation. She also modeled for photographers and, at the urging of her mother, studied drama and acting with Max Reinhardt's Theatrical Workshop and with acting coach Maria Ouspenskaya.\n\nCareer\n\nThe Outlaw\n\nIn 1940, Russell was signed to a seven-year contract by film mogul Howard Hughes, and made her motion-picture debut in The Outlaw (1943), a story about Billy the Kid that went to great lengths to showcase her voluptuous figure. The movie was completed in 1941, but it was not released until 1943 in a limited release. Problems occurred with the censorship of the production code over the way her ample cleavage was displayed. When the movie was finally passed, it had a general release in 1946. During that time, she was kept busy doing publicity and became known nationally. Contrary to countless incorrect reports in the media since the release of The Outlaw, Russell did not wear the specially designed underwire bra that Howard Hughes had designed and made for her to wear during filming. According to Jane's 1985 autobiography, she said that the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it and wore her own bra with the cups padded with tissue and the straps pulled up to elevate her breasts.  \n\nRussell's measurements were 38D-24-36, and she stood 5 ft 7 in (97-61-91 cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque than most of her contemporaries. Her favorite co-star Bob Hope once introduced her as \"the two and only Jane Russell\". He joked, \"Culture is the ability to describe Jane Russell without moving your hands.\" Howard Hughes said, \"There are two good reasons why men go to see her. Those are enough.\" A publicity still for the movie showed her lying on a pile of straw, her blouse stretched tight across her voluptuous breasts. Her right hand was behind her head of black hair and her left hand held a revolver. The image was a popular pin-up photo with servicemen during World War II. She did not appear in another movie until 1946, when she played Joan Kenwood in Young Widow for RKO.\n\nSpeaking about her sex appeal, Russell said, \"Sex appeal is good—but not in bad taste. Then it's ugly. I don't think a star has any business posing in a vulgar way. I've seen plenty of pin-up pictures that have sex appeal, interest, and allure, but they're not vulgar. They have a little art to them. Marilyn's calendar was artistic.\"  \n\nEarly musical ventures\n\nIn 1947, Russell attempted to launch a musical career. She sang with the Kay Kyser Orchestra on radio and recorded two singles with his band, \"As Long As I Live\" and \"Boin-n-n-ng!\" She also cut a 78 rpm album that year for Columbia Records, Let's Put Out the Lights, which included eight torch ballads and cover art that included a diaphanous gown that for once put the focus more on her legs than on her breasts. In a 2009 interview for the liner notes to another CD, Fine and Dandy, Russell denounced the Columbia album as \"horrible and boring to listen to.\" It was reissued on CD in 2002, in a package that also included the Kyser singles and two songs she recorded for Columbia in 1949 that had gone unreleased at the time. In 1950, she recorded a single, \"Kisses and Tears,\" with Frank Sinatra and The Modernaires for Columbia.\n\nMotion-picture stardom\n\nShe performed in an assortment of movie roles. She played Calamity Jane opposite Bob Hope in The Paleface (1948) on loan out to Paramount, and Mike \"the Torch\" Delroy opposite Hope in another western comedy, Son of Paleface (1952), again at Paramount. Russell played Dorothy Shaw in the hit film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) opposite Marilyn Monroe for 20th Century Fox.\n\n1950s\n\nShe appeared in two movies opposite Robert Mitchum: His Kind of Woman (1951) and Macao (1952). Other co-stars include Frank Sinatra and Groucho Marx in the comedy Double Dynamite (1951); Victor Mature, Vincent Price and Hoagy Carmichael in The Las Vegas Story (1952); Jeff Chandler in Foxfire (1955); and Clark Gable and Robert Ryan in The Tall Men (1955).\n\nIn Howard Hughes's RKO production The French Line (1954), the movie's penultimate moment showed Russell in a form-fitting one-piece bathing suit with strategic cutouts, performing a then-provocative musical number titled \"Lookin' for Trouble\". In her autobiography, Russell said that the revealing outfit was an alternative to Hughes' original suggestion of a bikini, a very racy choice for a movie costume in 1954. Russell said that she initially wore the bikini in front of her \"horrified\" movie crew while \"feeling very naked.\"\n\nIn 1955, Russell and her first husband, former Los Angeles Rams quarterback Bob Waterfield, formed Russ-Field Productions. They produced Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (1955) in which she starred alongside Jeanne Crain, The King and Four Queens (1956) starring Clark Gable and Eleanor Parker, Run for the Sun (1956) starring Richard Widmark and The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown (1957), which was a box-office failure.  She also starred in The Revolt of Mamie Stover (1956).\n\nReturn to music\n\nOn the musical front, Russell formed a gospel quartet in 1954, with three other members of a faith-sharing group called the Hollywood Christian Group. The other original members were Connie Haines, Beryl Davis, and Della Russell. Haines was a former vocalist in the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras, while Davis was a British emigrant who had moved to the U.S. after success entertaining American troops stationed in England during World War II. Della Russell was the wife of crooner Andy Russell. Backed by an orchestra conducted by Lyn Murray, their Coral single \"Do Lord\" reached number 27 on the Billboard singles chart in May 1954, selling two million copies. Della Russell, no relation to Jane, soon left the group, but Jane, Haines, and Davis followed up with a trio LP for Capitol Records, The Magic of Believing.  Later, another Hollywood bombshell, Rhonda Fleming, joined them for more gospel recordings. The Capitol LP was issued on CD in 2008, in a package that also included the Coral singles by the original quartet and two tracks with Fleming replacing Della Russell. A collection of some of Russell's gospel and secular recordings was issued on CD in Britain in 2005, and it includes more secular recordings, including Russell's spoken-word performances of Hollywood Riding Hood and Hollywood Cinderella backed by a jazz group that featured Terry Gibbs and Tony Scott. \n\nIn October 1957, she debuted in a successful solo nightclub act at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. She also fulfilled later engagements in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, South America, and Europe. A self-titled solo LP was issued on MGM Records in 1959. It was reissued on CD in 2009 under the title Fine and Dandy, and the CD included some demo and soundtrack recordings, as well. \"I finally got to make a record the way I wanted to make it,\" she said of the MGM album in the liner notes to the CD reissue. In 1959, she debuted with a tour of Janus in New England, performed in Skylark and also starred in Bells Are Ringing at the Westchester Town House in Yonkers, New York.  \n\nSilver-screen decline\n\nHer next movie appearance came in Fate Is the Hunter (1964), in which she was seen as herself performing for the USO in a flashback sequence. She made only four more movies after that, playing character parts in the final two. \n\nIn 1999, she remarked, \"Why did I quit movies? Because I was getting too old! You couldn't go on acting in those years if you were an actress over 30.\" \n\nOther venues\n\nIn 1971, she starred in the musical drama Company, making her debut on Broadway in the role of Joanne, succeeding Elaine Stritch. Russell performed the role of Joanne for almost six months. Also in the 1970s, she started appearing in television commercials as a spokeswoman for Playtex \"'Cross-Your-Heart Bras' for us full-figured gals\", featuring the \"18-Hour Bra\", still one of International Playtex's best-known products even as of early March 2011. She wrote an autobiography in 1985, Jane Russell: My Path and My Detours. In 1989, she received the Women's International Center  Living Legacy Award.\n\nRussell's hand- and footprints are immortalized at Grauman's Chinese Theatre  and she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6850 Hollywood Boulevard. \n\nRussell was voted one of the 40 Most Iconic Movie Goddesses of all time in 2009 by Glamour (UK edition). \n\nRussell was referenced in a 1956 episode of the Honeymooners. Ralph Kramden (played by Jackie Gleason) arrives home \"dead\" tired, vowing to go straight to bed after dinner, quipping \"If Jane Russell were throwing a party upstairs,  I wouldn't go!\"  Later, Kramden becomes aware that his best friend and neighbor, Ed Norton, is in fact throwing a party upstairs and did not invite him. After being reminded by his wife, Alice, of his reluctance to attend even a party that Jane Russell were throwing, an insulted Kramden rants, \"I was talking about Jane Russell: I said nothing about any party that Norton's running!\"\n\nPortrayals\n\nRussell was portrayed by Renee Henderson in the 2001 CBS miniseries Blonde, based on the novel by Joyce Carol Oates and portrayed leaving her imprints at Grauman's along with Marilyn Monroe in the HBO film Norma Jean & Marilyn, starring Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nRussell married three times. Her first husband was her high school sweetheart, Bob Waterfield, whom she married April 24, 1943, and divorced July 1968. He was a UCLA All-America, Cleveland Rams quarterback, Los Angeles Rams quarterback, Los Angeles Rams head coach, and member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. She was then married to actor Roger Barrett from August 25, 1968, until he died of a heart attack November 18, 1968. She married real estate broker John Calvin Peoples on January 31, 1974, living with him until his death from heart failure  April 9, 1999. Russell and Peoples lived in Sedona, Arizona, for a few years, but spent the majority of their married life residing in Montecito, California.\n\nAt age 18, she became pregnant while dating Waterfield, who in 1943 became her first husband. Russell went to a back-street abortionist. \"I had a botched abortion and it was terrible. Afterwards, my own doctor said: 'What butcher did this to you?' I had to be taken to the hospital. I was so ill I nearly died.\" The abortion left her infertile and for the remainder of her life she believed that abortion was wrong under any circumstances, even rape or incest.  She described herself as \"vigorously pro-life\". \n\nIn February 1952, Waterfield and she adopted a baby girl, Tracy. In December 1952, they adopted a 15-month-old boy, Thomas, whose birth mother, Hannah McDermott, had moved to London to escape poverty in Northern Ireland, and, in 1956, they adopted a nine-month-old boy, Robert John. In 1955, she founded World Adoption International Fund, an organization to place children with adoptive families and which pioneered adoptions from foreign countries by Americans.[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/01/us-janerussell-idUSTRE72001620110301 \"Jane Russell dead at 89\"], reuters.com; retrieved April 6, 2011 At the height of her career, Russell started the \"Hollywood Christian Group\", a weekly Bible study at her home which was attended by many of the leading names in the film industry.\n\nIn the 2013 film Philomena, Russell's photograph appears on a wall; a character states that Russell bought a child for £1000 from the tainted Sean Ross Abbey in Ireland featured in this true-life movie, but this claim is countered in at least one recent British report, which states that in the mid-1950s, Russell and her husband \"rather informally adopted a son from a woman living in London, but originating in Derry, Northern Ireland. There was a major scandal and a court case, after which Russell was allowed to formalise the adoption.\"\n\nIn 1953, she tried to convert Marilyn Monroe during the filming of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes; Monroe later said,  \"Jane tried to convert me (to religion) and I tried to introduce her to Freud\". Russell appeared occasionally on the Praise The Lord program on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, a Christian television channel based in Costa Mesa, California.\n\nRussell was a prominent supporter of the Republican Party and attended Dwight Eisenhower's inauguration along with such other notables from Hollywood as Lou Costello, Dick Powell, June Allyson, Hugh O'Brian, Anita Louise, and Louella Parsons. She was a recovering alcoholic who had gone into rehab at the age of 79 and described herself in a 2003 interview as \"These days I am a teetotal, mean-spirited, right-wing, narrow-minded, conservative Christian bigot, but not a racist.\"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/01/jane-russell-dies?INTCMP=SRCH \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes star Jane Russell dies at 89\"], guardian.co.uk, March 1, 2011; accessed August 20, 2014.\n\nRussell resided in the Santa Maria Valley along the Central Coast of California. She died at her home in Santa Maria of a respiratory-related illness on February 28, 2011.  She is survived by three children: Thomas Waterfield, Tracy Foundas, and Robert Waterfield. Her funeral was held on March 12, 2011, at Pacific Christian Church, Santa Maria. \n\nFilmography\n\n* The Outlaw (1943)\n* Young Widow (1946)\n* The Paleface (1948)\n* His Kind of Woman (1951)\n* Double Dynamite (1951)\n* The Las Vegas Story (1952)\n* Macao (1952)\n* Son of Paleface (1952)\n* Montana Belle (1952)\n* Road to Bali (1952; cameo)\n* Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)\n* The French Line (1954)\n* Underwater!

The best advice I can offer is to feed these darling creatures an abundance of hay as long as it's Timothy as it's low in protein (Oxbow is the best company out there to order hay from...it's incredibly high quality and smells unbelievably fresh...once you've tried it it's hard to go back to the usual store bought brands). The rabbits appreciate it tremendously and it is now considered very good practice by many rabbit savvy vets and rescuers to give rabbits unlimited hay daily, again as long as it's Timothy. Supplementing alfalfa or other hays in every now and then is fine but Alfalfa is too high in protein. Also check out rabbitcare.org.\nClick For Replies (1)\nAnnie - 2014-08-08\nThank you for the hay advice and rabbitcare.org. Just adopted a speckled black and white  holland lop less than 6 months old and female!",
                "New Zealand - Mosaic's Rabbitry\nMosaic's Rabbitry\nNew Zealand\nThe History of New Zealand\nThe New Zealand White actually originated in the United States and was bred in 1916 by a Californian breeder seeking to develop a valuable rabbit for the meat and fur trade. \nThe New Zealand came into existence through a convoluted background of breedings and crosses throughout the county. The first variety to be established was the New Zealand Red. \nIt is commonly believed that the red coloration was the result of a cross between a Belgian Hare and a White rabbit. This particular cross was performed in numerous places across the county, as the New Zealand Red appeared in both California and Indiana simultaneously. The New Zealand Red became known across the country in 1912, and has continued to be one of the more popular breeds since. The White variety was a result of crossing numerous breeds to achieve the desired New Zealand characteristics. These breeds included the: Flemish Giant, American Whites, Angoras and perhaps a Red or two. Several strains began to emerge from different crosses across the county. Joe Wojcik, of Elyria, Ohio, developed the most notable line of whites for the time period. The New Zealand White variety was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeders Association in the mid 1920's. The Black variety was developed much later using many crosses including the Giant Chinchilla. Through the efforts of the Californian breeders and Dr. DeCastro in the East the Black variety was born. The Broken variety has been a recent addition to the New Zealand breed and was accepted by A.R.B.A. February 2010 by David Mangione. Now broken blacks and broken reds can be shown and compete for Best of Breed and Best Opposite Sex of Breed. Currently there is a C.O.D. out for the development of the Blue variety. The New Zealand breed has been transformed over the course of a near century, and is still being developed to this day.\nThe New Zealand Standard\nThe New Zealand is a large sized rabbit weighing in at about 9-11 lbs. for senior bucks and 10-12 lbs. for senior does. The New Zealand is to have a commercial body type that creates the impression of balance and uniformity.The breed is to exemplify meat producing qualities including: well rounded hips, well filled loin, and ribs that carry forward to combine with the shoulders to balance with the rest of the body. The body of the New Zealand is to be of medium length, with good depth and with shoulders blending smoothly into the midsection, and midsection blending smoothly into the hindquarters. When a New Zealand is viewed from the side, the topline should start immediately at the base of the ears and rise in a continuous curve to the high point over the center of the hips and then fall downward in a smooth curve to the base of the tail. When the New Zealand is viewed from above the sides of the rabbit should tape slightly from hindquarters toward the shoulders creating the ideal meat production animal. Overall the New Zealand rabbit should represent the ideal meat qualities necessary for commercial rabbit production.\nTemperament\nNew Zealands are exceptionally calm and docile rabbits. With their extremely laid-back personalities they are usually very content to be handled and excellent with children and other pets.\nNew Zealand Colors\n(Credit and Source: manmrabbitry.com, swansrabbitry.com, bustersbunnybarn.weebly.com)\nNew Zealands are shown in four recognized varieties: Black, Broken, Red, and White.\nNew Zealand White\nThe New Zealand White  color is to be pure white. Eyes- Pink. Faults— Soiled or stained. Ivory cast.\nNew Zealand Red\nThe New Zealand Red color is to be a bright reddish sorrel, but not so dark as to be a mahogany red. Color shall carry as deep down the hair shaft as possible. The belly color should approximate the top color. It may be somewhat lighter in shade, approaching a deep creamy cast, but must not be pure white. White on the underside of the tail, or on foot pads is permitted.Eyes - Brown. Faults - Light or dark ticking, when sufficient to produce ear lacing or body smut; white hairs in pelt; large white eye circles; creamy collar around the neck. Disqualification from Competition - A marked departure from the standard color, to the extent of being mahogany red or a light brassy or fawn color. Heavy ear lacing or body smut. Patch(es) of excessive white hair; very conspicuous stray white hairs; white shadow bars on the front or hind feet.\nNew Zealand Black\nThe New Zealand Black color is to be a uniform, jet black throughout. Under color is to be dark slate blue. Eyes -Dark brown. Faults - Stray white hairs; brownish cast. Disqualification from Competition - Patch(es) of excessive white hair; very conspicuous stray white hairs; excessive brownish cast; white shadow bars on front or hind feet.\nNew Zealand Broken\nThe New Zealand Broken is the newest and most complex of the four New Zealand varieties. Brokens are to include any recognized variety of the breed or variety within a group, in conjunction with white. Colored sections on Brokens are to match the standard for the colored variety. Color and Pattern - Brokens are to have both ears colored, with color around the eyes, and on the nose.  (No preference given for a full butterfly over an evenly balanced nose marking.)  The body pattern may be spotted, with individual colored spots or patches over the back, sides, and hips: or a blanket pattern with color starting at or near the neck, and continuing over the back, sides, and hips.  The preference is for an evenly balanced pattern. Toenails may be white, colored, or any combination of the two. Eyes - The eye color is to correspond with the eye color specified under the respective solid color variety. Faults — Unbalanced nose marking; unbalanced body markings; scattered white hairs in colored markings; white spots (not drags or ragged ear base) on the ears; Color in excess of 50%. Disqualifications from Competition — The complete absence of color on the nose; (Note:  Color appearing in any area where a butterfly would normally occur satisfies the requirement for a nose marking), on either ear; or around either eye; color less than 10% of the entire animal; excessive amount of scattered white hairs in the colored markings; eye color other than called for under the respective color descriptions; foreign colored spot(s). No Disqualification for White Spot(s) In Colored Sections\nCreate a free website",

They make a make a great rabbit for the beginner to the well advanced exhibitor.\nThe adult Dutch (over 6 months old) weight should be between 3 1/2 lbs to 5 1/2 lbs.\nPolish Rabbit -\nThe Polish is one of the smaller domestic rabbit breeds, having a maximum weight allowance of 3½ lbs. and an ideal weight of 2½ lbs. They are popular rabbits for show and exhibition.\nAmerican Rabbit -\nThe American rabbit is a multi-purpose animal developed for meat and fur. Americans are large rabbits with mature bucks weighing 9 to 11 pounds and does at 10 to 12 pounds. They are a hardy breed, docile in nature, produce large litters and are typically good mothers. Fryers make marketable weight fairly quickly and are easily kept on wire bottom hutches. The blue variety is the deepest blue color of any of the recognized breeds in America.\nBeveren Rabbit -\nBeverens have a pronounced mandolin body type, are hardy and docile with good personalities, having usually good mothering instincts. Kits have a moderately good grow-out rate (but not beating NZWs). With fur length being between 1 and 1 1/2 inches long, the Beveren is an excellent dual-purpose rabbit, useful for both meat and fur. Beverens varieties include blue, blue-eyed-white, and black only. Bucks should weigh between 9-11 pounds, and does weigh between 10-12 lb.\nCalifornia Rabbit -\nCalifornian Rabbits are a favorite choice for commercial and backyard meat rabbit production.  California rabbits are white bodied, with dark ears, nose, feet, tail (points) and have red eyes.  Adult bucks should weigh 8-10 pounds, with 9 pounds being ideal. Adult does should weigh 8 1/2 - 10 1/2 pounds, with 9½ pounds being ideal.\nChampagne Rabbit -\nThe Champagne d'Argent exemplifies a commercial, meat rabbit type, being full in the shoulders and deep in the hindquarters.  They are an old rabbit breed, born pitch black and silver out as they age. They can tip the scales at up to 12 pounds.\nSome photos and breed descriptions supplied from Raising-Rabbits.com\nNew Zealand Rabbit -\nNew Zealands are now the perfect example of a meat producing breed - firm, meaty, full depth and breadth of hindquarters and slightly less so in the shoulders.  New Zealand senior (adult) bucks weigh 9-11 pounds; senior (adult) does weigh 10-12 pounds. New Zealand Whites are the breed of choice for most commercial rabbit operations. Until recently, white fur was preferred as stray hairs would be less noticed against the pale meat. Additionally, white fur can be dyed to a color of choice, if desired. Fryers gain weight rapidly, reaching 5 pounds by 8 weeks or close to it.\nLionhead Rabbit -\nThe Lionhead is a fairly short-furred little rabbit, with the exception of a mane of long wool around the face, neck, and possibly low on the flanks. They are about 3 1/2 pounds in size and make good pets. They have the appearance of little lions.\nNetherland Dwarf Rabbit -\nNetherland Dwarf is the Number One most popular rabbit breed across the globe. They are small and compact in size and usually weight between 2 and 2 1/2 pounds.  They come in a variety of colors. They make good pets due to their size, but do require special knowledge in the breeding of these rabbits as they carry certain genes that are known to cause birth defects.\nHolland Lop Rabbit -\nHolland Lop Rabbits are the second most popular rabbit breed worldwide (Netherland Dwarfs taking first place).  They are well suited as pets due to their docile temperment and small size.  They are about 4 pounds when full grown. \nFlemish Giant Rabbit -\nFlemish Giant Rabbits are the mammoth rabbits of the rabbit world, and the basis of all giant rabbit breeds. It is thought that every single giant rabbit breed today is based upon the Flemish Giant Rabbit as it was known circa 1900.  Bucks and does are considered adults at 8 months of age. An adult buck's minimum weight should be 13 pounds, and an adult doe's minimum weight 14 pounds. Flemish Giants are typically docile in nature.\n \nThe following breeds are typically used for pets/companions due to their smaller size.\nThese following breeds are typically used more for meat production, although the dispositions of some breeds make great pets.",

                "Donald \"Ginger\" McCain (21 September 1930 – 19 September 2011) was an English National Hunt horse trainer, perhaps best known for training Red Rum. A successful trainer who won many races, he trained Red Rum at a Southport beach on Merseyside, where McCain was born.\n\nA former national serviceman in the Royal Air Force as a motorcycle despatch rider, he was also a member of the RAF scrambling team. \n\nHorseracing\n\nMcCain applied for a training permit in 1953 and began training horses in 1962, using small stables behind the showroom of his used-car store in his hometown of Southport. He bought a horse for 6,000 guineas   that turned out to be suffering from a debilitating bone disease. The horse was Red Rum.\n\nMcCain trained the winner of the Grand National steeplechase four times, three times in the 1970s with Red Rum and a fourth time in 2004 with Amberleigh House.  His first and fourth victories were over 30 years apart.\n\nThe 1973 Grand National  is considered by many to be the greatest Grand National and was a duel of nine minutes two seconds between Red Rum and Crisp, with L'Escargot (a previous double Cheltenham Gold Cup winner and future 1975 Grand National winner) well beaten in third place. The winning time broke the course record that had stood for nearly 40 years and remained unbeaten until it was bettered by Mr Frisk in the 1990 Grand National immediately after a number of safety changes sped up the course for that year. \n\nFred Rimell is the only other person to train four winners of the Grand National.\n\nIn his final Grand National in 2006, McCain entered three horses: Inca Trail, who ran well for a long way until running out of stamina two fences from home and finishing eighth; Ebony Light, who fell; and Amberleigh House, who was pulled up. \n\nMcCain retired after the 2006 National, handing over control of the stable to his son, Donald, Jr., who trained 2011 National winner Ballabriggs.\n\nAfter watching the 2011 Grand National, where there were two equine fatalities, McCain expressed concern that the lowering of the fences in aid of safety was having the opposite impact through speeding up the race and increasing the risk of equine fatalities.   Following further fatalities in the 2012 Grand National, a far cry from the lower equine fatalities of the 1950s and 1960s (apart from four equine fatalities at the 1954 Grand National and where there was an unusually small field of runners), these concerns are being increasingly openly expressed by other National Hunt and Grand National experts, and the wisdom of the approach to improving safety from the 1989 Grand National onwards is coming under close scrutiny.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMcCain married Beryl Harris in Southport in March 1961; the couple had two children: Joanne and Donald, Jr.[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article356475.ece Ginger McCain: Mr Aintree], The Independent, 8 April 2006 McCain worked as a taxi driver to supplement his income as a trainer prior to finding Grand National success. It was as a taxi driver that he became acquainted with Noel le Mare, on whose behalf Red Rum was purchased.\n\nDeath\n\nMcCain died from cancer on 19 September 2011, two days before his 81st birthday.  On the opening day of the 2012 Grand National a bronze statue of McCain was unveiled at Aintree Racecourse looking down on the winning post where his victories unfolded."

                "David Copperfield: Character Profiles | Novelguide\nDavid Copperfield: Character Profiles\nTotal Votes: 207\nDavid Copperfield\nDavid is the narrator and protagonist of the novel, which tells the story of his life. As a boy, despite his difficult upbringing, he is naive, innocent, and well-meaning. The adult David narrates his childhood experiences from the point of view of the innocent child rather than the more knowing adult. This means that the reader can often see characters' true motives and intentions when David cannot. For example, he admires and loves Steerforth from the time when he first meets him, and believes that Steerforth has his best interests at heart, whereas the reader can clearly see that Steerforth is a self-centered person who exploits David and belittles him. By the end of the novel, when David is an adult, he can see Steerforth's selfishness and frivolity, though he still loves him and thinks of him at his best. This shows that David has grown in understanding, but retained his fundamental innocence.\nThough David has a warm heart, he has weaknesses. Chief of these is his emotional immaturity or \"undisciplined heart\" (to quote Annie Strong's words in Chapter XLV), which leads him to fall in love with and marry Dora, who is childish, frivolous, and unsuited to him. In doing so, he throws away the calmer love of Agnes, who is a perfect match for him, consigning her to the role of beloved sister. The death of Dora and other events in David's life have a maturing effect on him, and he eventually realizes that he has always loved Agnes. At the novel's end, she becomes his second wife, and they are blissfully happy together.\nDavid's story contains many autobiographical elements from Dickens's own life. Dickens's family, like David's, traumatized him by removing him from school and sending him to work in a factory, to bring in much-needed money. They did so because Dickens's father, like Mr. Micawber, was irresponsible with money and frequently in debt, leading to his incarceration in the debtors' prison.\nAgnes Wickfield\nAgnes is the daughter of Mr. Wickfield and David's second wife. She is the closest thing to a perfect person in the novel. She loves her father and David and is an unfailing support to both men. Even when David marries Dora, Agnes selflessly puts her own love for him aside and never gives way to jealousy or melancholy. She remains a loyal friend to him, always willing to offer wise advice and affection, and also befriends Dora.\nJames Steerforth\nThe handsome, charming, and wealthy Steerforth befriends David at Mr. Creakle's school. David loves him and believes him to be a true friend; he is too innocent to see that Steerforth is self-seeking and vain, and that he exploits and belittles David. All these truths are, however, clear to the reader, thereby underscoring the gap between the naïve young David and the knowing reader.\nSteerforth is a snob, as is clear from his patronizing attitude to people who are poorer and less privileged than him, such as the schoolmaster Mr. Mell, and Ham. The incident in which Steerforth scarred Rosa Dartle's face for life by throwing a hammer at her reveals a disturbing streak of violence in his character. The incident prefigures the destruction and chaos he causes in Mr. Peggotty's family by seducing Ham's fianc�e, Little Em'ly, and vanishing with her. He is too frivolous and restless a character to love her properly, and soon abandons her.\nSteerforth does have the occasional glimmer of conscience, such as when, before he takes Little Em'ly away, he wishes he were as innocent as David. But he manages to ignore its promptings and continues on his immoral course. Steerforth's death is as reckless as his life: he drowns when his boat is wrecked in a storm, clinging to the mast and waving a red cap in the air at the onlookers. Ham dies trying to rescue him.\nDora Spenlow\nDora is David's first wife. She is childish, frivolous and silly. More importantly, she is unsuited to being David's wife, in that her mind is no match for David's and she is utterly incapable of the most basic housekeeping tasks. On the other hand, she is a joyous, playful, and beautiful woman who adores David and inspires all who know her to love and protect her - including David. Her friend Julia Mills, while warning David that his attempts to educate her in housekeeping will almost certainly fail, calls Dora \"a thing of light, and airiness, and joy.\" Though David attempts to \"form\" Dora's mind after they are married, he only makes her miserable and soon abandons the project.\nDora is never strong, and falls ill after becoming pregnant and losing the baby, either through miscarriage or stillbirth. On her deathbed, Dora tells David she believes that she married too young. Then, she tells Agnes that she 'bequeaths' David to her. David is grief-stricken by Dora's death, but it frees him to give way to the quieter, more mature love he shares with Agnes.\nBetsey Trotwood\nBetsey is David's aunt. She turns up at David's mother's house on the day David is born, but marches off in disgust when she finds out that the baby is a boy. David does not see her again until he runs away from the factory job that his stepfather, Mr. Murdstone, forced him into. He goes to Betsey, as his only known relative, and she adopts him and becomes a second mother to him. Betsey is an irascible but kindly woman who mistrusts the male sex, having been betrayed by a husband she loved. Her eccentricities include a fastidious dislike of donkeys trampling on her lawn; an absolute confidence in the remarkable qualities of the simple-minded Mr. Dick, another of her adoptees; and a concern that people should not make unwise matches, as she did. When David falls in love with Dora, she comments in exasperation, \"blind, blind, blind!\"/span>\nThough Betsey at first expresses contempt for silly, immature and incapable women such as Clara Copperfield and Dora, she becomes very fond of Dora. This shows that in spite of Betsey's abrupt manner and tendency not to suffer fools gladly, her heart is warm.\nClara Peggotty\nPeggotty is David's nurse when he is a child. She loves David and cares for him her whole life. After Mr. Murdstone marries Clara Copperfield, Peggotty is David's - and his mother's - main source of motherly love and support. After Clara Copperfield's death, Peggotty and Betsey become surrogate mothers to David. Peggotty marries Mr. Barkis.\nMr. Daniel Peggotty\nMr. Peggotty is Clara Peggotty's brother. He is a fisherman who lives in a house made from an overturned boat on the beach in Yarmouth. Mr. Peggotty's household is made up of orphans (Little Em'ly and Ham) and a widow (Mrs. Gummidge) whose fathers and husband were drowned at sea. He generously cares and provides for them all. After Little Em'ly runs away with Steerforth, Mr. Peggotty devotes his life to searching for her. When he finds her, he emigrates with her to Australia so that she can make a fresh start. David says of Mr. Peggotty in Chapter LI that he \"thought of everybody's claims and strivings, but his own.\"\nMr. Peggoty, Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge are all simple yet virtuous people, and are contrasted with sophisticated villains like Uriah Heep and Steerforth.\nLittle Em'ly\nLittle Em'ly is Peggotty's niece. She was taken in and brought up by Mr. Peggotty when her father drowned at sea. As a boy, David falls in love with Little Em'ly. She is vain, and has a strong desire to be a lady, which proves her downfall. Though she is engaged to Ham, she is enchanted by Steerforth's wealth and charm, and allows him to seduce her and take her away from her family. When he abandons her, she is a disgraced woman. Eventually, she is found by Mr. Peggotty, who takes her with him to Australia to escape her ruined reputation and make a fresh start. There, she refuses all marriage proposals and devotes herself to hard work on the family farm and acts of kindness and charity to her neighbors. With Mrs. Gummidge, Little Em'ly is the character who most transforms herself through suffering.\nHam\nHam is a young fisherman who was taken in and looked after by Mr. Peggotty when his father was drowned at sea. He courts Little Em'ly and they become engaged, but then Little Em'ly runs away with Steerforth. Ham is heart-broken. He drowns while selflessly trying to save Steerforth from a shipwreck.\nMrs. Gummidge\nMrs. Gummidge is a sailor's widow who was taken in and looked after by Mr. Peggotty when her husband was drowned at sea. She complains constantly of being a poor \"lone and lorn\" creature since her husband died. After Little Em'ly runs away with Steerforth, Mrs. Gummidge, who had been devoted to the girl, undergoes a transformation. She stops complaining, supports Mr. Peggotty, and keeps his house while he is away looking for Little Em'ly. After Little Em'ly is found, Mrs. Gummidge goes with her and Mr. Peggotty to live in Australia, where she works hard on the family farm and even receives a proposal of marriage.\nUriah Heep\nUriah is a devious and hypocritical villain who stands in contrast to David. The contrast is made more visible by the fact that Uriah has a similar background to David's, in that both came from poor families. However, they have responded to the challenges of their upbringing in opposite ways. Uriah has become bitter and manipulative, putting on a false show of being \"umble\" when he is really controlling others for his own ends. He feels that he is entitled to rewards to make up for the humiliations he suffered in his youth. To this end, he ensnares Mr. Wickfield, robbing him of his power and authority and embezzling his money. David, on the other hand, has responded to his difficult childhood by remaining trusting, loving, and honest. He gains his ends not by cheating others but by working hard and maintaining his integrity.\nAt the beginning of the novel, Uriah is an employee in the law firm of Mr. Wickfield. He rises by dishonest means to become a partner in the firm, and hopes to marry Agnes. His ambitions in law and regarding Agnes provide another similarity to David. It is perhaps because of these similarities that Uriah regards David as his deadly rival.\nDickens portrays Uriah as evil by using demonic imagery: Uriah writhes like a snake (the serpent is a Biblical symbol of the devil), and he has red hair and eyes. When Mr. Micawber exposes Uriah's frauds against Mr. Wickfield, there is a terrifying scene in which Uriah suddenly drops his mask of humbleness and shows himself to be violent and full of hatred towards David.\nUnlike Steerforth, Uriah utterly lacks a conscience. When he is imprisoned for bank fraud, he resumes his act of humbleness and convinces the prison reformers that he is a true penitent, but his hypocritical public 'forgiveness' of the almost entirely innocent David alerts the reader to the fact that Uriah has not changed in the least.\nClara Copperfield\nClara Copperfield is David's mother. Like Dora, she is beautiful, gentle, and loving, but also like Dora, she is childlike and impractical. Her second husband, Mr. Murdstone, and his sister, Miss Murdstone, are cruel to her, crushing her joyful spirit and eventually making her fatally ill. Betsey nicknames her \"poor baby,\" conveying her immaturity and helplessness in the face of the Murdstones.\nMr. Edward Murdstone and Miss Jane Murdstone\nMr. Murdstone is Clara Copperfield's second husband, and Miss Murdstone is his sister. Mr. Murdstone is a strict and cruel man whose motive in marrying Clara appears to be to crush her spirit and control her, under the pretence of improving her mind and \"firmness\" of character. In this, he is aided by his sister, Miss Murdstone, who is a female version of him. The Murdstones treat David with equal brutality, and make it clear from the beginning that they want him out of the way. After Clara's death, Mr. Murdstone takes David out of school and sends him away to work in a factory; David never returns to his household. By the end of the novel, Mr. Murdstone has married again and is reported to be destroying his new wife as surely as he did Clara. For a short period, Miss Murdstone becomes a paid companion to Dora, whom she bosses about just as she did Clara.\nDr. Strong and Annie Strong\nDr. Strong is the elderly headmaster of the school in which Betsey enrolls David to complete his broken education. A kind and generous man, Dr. Strong has married a much younger and very beautiful woman, Annie. Annie comes from a poor family and her relatives, particularly her mother, use her name to extort money from Dr. Strong. Annie is ashamed of their behavior, not least because it gives rise to a popular suspicion that she only married Dr. Strong for his money. Some of the people who believe that Annie has ulterior motives in her marriage also believe that she is having an affair with her cousin, Jack Maldon. Uriah Heep exploits both these suspicions, and tells Dr. Strong that Annie and Jack are lovers, upsetting Dr. Strong and driving a wedge between him and his wife. In fact, both suspicions are false. Annie is faithful to her husband, whom she loves deeply, and mercenary considerations played no part in her decision to marry him.\nMr. Dick encourages Annie to speak out her true feelings to Dr. Strong; this clears the air, and they are reconciled. The Strongs are an example of true compatibility in marriage. Though they are very different from each other in superficial measures like age and attractiveness, in Annie's words, they are alike in \"mind and purpose.\"\nJack Maldon\nJack Maldon is Annie Strong's cousin and childhood sweetheart. He continues to love her and tries to persuade her to leave Dr. Strong for him. Dr. Strong and Mr. Wickfield find him a job in India but he returns, ostensibly because the climate does not agree with him, but really because he cannot bear to be away from Annie.\nMr. Spenlow\nMr. Spenlow is the father of Dora Spenlow and David's employer during his days as a proctor at the Doctors' Commons. He dies suddenly, immediately after opposing David's planned marriage to Dora.\nMr. Dick\nMr. Dick is a simple-minded man who lives in Betsey's house. His brother wanted to have him put in a lunatic asylum, but Betsey is confident that he has a remarkable mind that only she fully recognizes. In return, Mr. Dick thinks of Betsey as \"the most wonderful woman in the world.\" Mr. Dick has an obsession with King Charles I, which distracts him from doing any useful work, and is trying to write his autobiography (\"Memorial\"). He has a gentle and loving heart; this, and his lack of intellectual rigor often enable him to know and do the right thing when more intelligent people are paralyzed by complexities. When David turns up, ragged and covered in dust, on Betsey's doorstep, it is Mr. Dick who suggests that the next step is to give him a bath. When the Strongs are set at odds with each other by Uriah's false accusations, it is Mr. Dick who reconciles them.\nMr. Dick loves to fly his kite, which he does with David.\nMr. Wickfield\nMr. Wickfield is Agnes's father. He and Agnes are devoted to each other. As a friend, lawyer, and financial advisor to Betsey, Mr. Wickfield provides a home to David when he attends Dr. Strong's school. Mr. Wickfield employs Uriah Heep as a clerk in his law firm. Uriah exploits Mr. Wickfield's weakness for alcohol in order to gain power over him. There is irony in this process, in that Mr. Wickfield is so eager to see ulterior motives in others that he wrongly suspects Annie Strong of having an affair with Jack Maldon, but at the same time he is blind to Uriah's motives, enabling Uriah to enslave him and to take over his business and his home. Uriah embezzles Mr. Wickfield's money, but Traddles manages to restore it to him after Mr. Micawber exposes Uriah's frauds.\nTommy Traddles\nTraddles is David's schoolmate. He is a warm-hearted and loyal friend to David. Though he is poor, Traddles works hard and succeeds in scraping the money together to train as a lawyer. Against severe odds, Traddles finally enjoys success and a happy marriage to his beloved Sophy. With Mr. Micawber, Traddles plays a part in unmasking Uriah's frauds and in restoring the money that Uriah stole from Mr. Wickfield and Betsey.\nMr. Wilkins Micawber\nMr. Micawber is a well-meaning man who is always in financial difficulties. He is unable to find reasonably paid employment and frequently receives visits from bailiffs and debt collectors, who seize his property to offset upaid debts. He spends some time in the debtors' prison. Mr. Micawber swings between despair at his money problems and cheerful optimism that \"something\" will \"turn up\" to save him from ruin - the latter mood generally prevailing after he has eaten a lavish dinner.\nThe turnaround in Mr. Micawber's life comes when Uriah Heep gives him a job as his clerk. Mr. Micawber is expected to collude in Uriah's frauds. His conscience makes him miserable for a time and at last prompts him to gather evidence and expose Uriah. This is an act of selflessness because it involves losing his job. He is rewarded for his sacrifice when Betsey, grateful for the return of the money that Uriah stole from her, encourages him to emigrate to Australia with his family and loans him the money for his journey. He does so, and becomes successful and respected there.\nThe model for Mr. Micawber is widely believed to be Dickens's father.\nMrs. Micawber\nMrs. Micawber is Mr. Micawber's wife. She is from a socially superior family to her husband's, and her relatives all disapprove of him because of his financial problems. Nevertheless, she is devoted to her husband, standing by him in his difficulties and never losing faith in his abilities. Her favorite expression is, \"I never will desert Mr. Micawber.\" Students of the psychoanalytical theory of the unconscious may wonder if this is because the possibility of deserting Mr. Micawber is ever-present at the back of her mind, however unacceptable it may be to her conscious awareness.\nMrs. Steerforth\nMrs. Steerforth is James Steerforth's wealthy mother. A proud and arrogant woman, she dotes on her son to such an extent that she has spoiled him. Mrs. Steerforth treats David contemptuously when he is not occupying his role of admirer of Steerforth. When Steerforth takes away Little Em'ly, Mrs. Steerforth blames Little Em'ly for bringing disgrace upon the Steerforth family. Mrs. Steerforth never recovers from Steerforth's death, remaining bitter and quarreling with Rosa about who loved him best.\nRosa Dartle\nRosa Dartle is a distant relative of the Steerforths, an orphan, and a ward of Mrs. Steerforth's. She has a deep scar on her face, made by Steerforth as a boy when he threw a hammer at her because she exasperated him. The wound is symbolic of the inner hurt that she nurses as a result of years of unrequited and suppressed love for Steerforth. She has become bitter and sarcastic. She mercilessly picks apart Steerforth's assumptions with seemingly innocent but pointed questions which she poses under the pretence of trying to educate herself. Like Mrs. Steerforth, Rosa fails to move on from Steerforth's death, and the two continue to quarrel about which of them loved him best.\nLittimer\nLittimer is Steerforth's servant. He is discreet and polite, and has the impeccable manners of the well-trained English servant. Dickens calls him \"respectable\" so often that the word gains a heavy irony, which reaches its peak when Littimer colludes with his master in taking away Little Em'ly. After Steerforth abandons her, he suggests to Littimer that he (Littimer) marry her. When Little Em'ly reacts with horror, Littimer becomes her jailer, keeping her locked in a room until she manages to escape. Such activities, of course, are so far from respectable as to be morally depraved.\nMiss Mowcher\nMiss Mowcher is a dwarf who is a professional hairdresser. She cuts Steerforth's hair and then carries a letter from him to Little Em'ly which leads Little Em'ly to run away with him. Miss Mowcher is willing to carry this letter because she has been falsely led to think that it warns Little Em'ly against the predatory intentions of David. When Miss Mowcher learns of Steerforth's betrayal, she is full of sorrow at the part she unwittingly played in Little Em'ly's downfall. Miss Mowcher redeems herself by carrying out a citizens?' arrest of Littimer and holding him until the police arrive to arrest him.\nMiss Mowcher acts as a mouthpiece for Dickens in proclaiming the rights of people who are disabled or different to treated with respect.\nMartha\nMartha is a young woman whom Little Em'ly befriends when they both work at Mr. Omer's. Martha subsequently falls into disgrace; it is implied, though not explicitly said, that she works as a prostitute. Martha is redeemed when she devotes herself to the search for Little Em'ly, finds her, and restores her to Mr. Peggotty. She is rewarded by being taken to Australia by Mr. Peggotty, where she marries.\nMr. Creakle\nMr. Creakle is the brutal headmaster of the school to which Mr. Murdstone sends David. He never speaks above a whisper, gives beatings for the slightest misdemeanor, and is much feared by the boys. After David becomes famous, Mr. Creakle, who is now in charge of a prison, writes to invite him to meet some prisoners who are shining examples of Mr. Creakle's reforming methods. The prisoners turn out to be Uriah and Littimer, who, David perceives, are not in the least reformed.\nMr. Barkis\nMr. Barkis is a coach driver who subsequently marries Peggotty. He is a man of few words, and his courtship of Peggotty consists mostly of a single phrase: \"Barkis is willing,\" conveyed to her via David. He is a good man, though mean with money, which he keeps in a secret box under his bed.",

Aber: Es handelt sich hierbei nicht um das bekannte Buch von Dickens!!! Umschlag und Titel entsprechen den Angaben. Im Buch ist allerdings ein völlig anderer Text abgedruckt (das Theaterstück \"Electra\"). Jetzt ist mir auch aufgefallen, dass die Seitenanzahl mit 66 angegeben ist- damit kann es sich eigentlich nicht um das Buch \"David Copperfield\" handeln- aber wer achtet schon vorher auf die Seitenzahl??

                "David Copperfield by Charles Dickens · OverDrive: eBooks, audiobooks and videos for libraries\nJuvenile Fiction Juvenile Literature\nThe story traces the life of David Copperfield from childhood to maturity. David was born in Blunderstone, Suffolk, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England, in 1820, six months after the death of his father. David spends his early years in relative happiness with his loving but frail mother and their kindly housekeeper, Peggotty. When he is seven years old his mother marries Edward Murdstone. David is given good reason to dislike his stepfather and has similar feelings for Murdstone's sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards. Murdstone attempts to thrash David for falling behind in his studies. David bites him and soon afterwards is sent away to a boarding school, Salem House, with a ruthless headmaster, Mr. Creakle. There he befriends James Steerforth and Tommy Traddles.David returns home for the holidays to learn that his mother has given birth to a baby boy. Shortly after David returns to Salem House, his mother and her baby die, and David returns home immediately. Peggotty marries a man named Mr Barkis. Murdstone sends David to work for a wine merchant in London – a business of which Murdstone is a joint owner. Copperfield's landlord, Wilkins Micawber, is sent to debtors' prison (the King's Bench Prison) and remains there for several months before being released and moving to Plymouth. No one remains to care for David in London, so he decides to run away.He walks from London to Dover, where he finds his only relative, his unmarried, eccentric great-aunt Betsey Trotwood. She agrees to raise him, despite Murdstone's attempt to regain custody of David. David's great-aunt renames him \"Trotwood Copperfield\" and addresses him as \"Trot\", and it becomes one of several names to which David answers in the course of the novel. As David grows to adulthood, a variety of characters enter, leave, and re-enter his life. These include Peggotty and her family, including her orphaned niece \"Little Em'ly\", who moves in with them and charms the young David. David's romantic but self-serving school friend, Steerforth, seduces and dishonours Emily, precipitating the novel's greatest tragedy, and Agnes Wickfield, the daughter of David's landlord, becomes his confidante. The novel's two most familiar characters are David's sometime mentor, the debt-ridden Micawber, and the devious and fraudulent clerk, Uriah Heep, whose misdeeds are eventually revealed with Micawber's assistance. Micawber is painted sympathetically even as the narrator deplores his financial ineptitude. Micawber, like Dickens's own father, is briefly imprisoned for insolvency. The major characters eventually get some measure of what they deserve, and few narrative threads are left hanging. Peggotty's brother Dan takes Emily to a new life in Australia, accompanied by the widowed Mrs. Gummidge and the Micawbers. All eventually find security and happiness in their adopted country. David marries the beautiful but naïve Dora Spenlow, who dies after failing to recover from a miscarriage early"

                "Suriname (, or, also spelled Surinam), officially known as the Republic of Suriname (,), is a sovereign state on the northeastern Atlantic coast of South America. It is bordered by French Guiana to the east, Guyana to the west and Brazil to the south. At just under 165000 km2, it is the smallest country in South America. Suriname has a population of approximately 566,000, most of whom live on the country's north coast, in and around the capital and largest city, Paramaribo.\n\nOriginally inhabited by a number of indigenous tribes, Suriname was explored and contested by European powers before coming under Dutch rule in the late 17th century. In 1954 the country became one of the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. On 25 November 1975, the country of Suriname left the Kingdom of the Netherlands to become an independent state, nonetheless maintaining close economic, diplomatic, and cultural ties to its former colonizer.\n\nSuriname is considered to be a culturally Caribbean country, and is a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). While Dutch is the official language of government, business, media and education, Sranan, an English-based creole language, is a widely used lingua franca. Suriname is the only territory outside Europe where Dutch is spoken by a majority of the population. The people of Suriname are among the most diverse in the world, spanning a multitude of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups.\n\nEtymology \n \nThis area was occupied by various cultures of indigenous peoples long before European contact, remnants of which can be found in petroglyph sites at Werehpai and other places in Suriname. The name Suriname may derive from a Taino (Arawak-speaking) indigenous people called Surinen, who inhabited the area at the time of European contact.\"Suriname\", The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Volume 5. Edition 15, Encyclopædia Britannica, 2002, p. 547\n\nBritish settlers, who founded the first European colony at Marshall's Creek  along the Suriname River, spelled the name as \"Surinam\".\n\nWhen the territory was taken over by the Dutch, it became part of a group of colonies known as Dutch Guiana. The official spelling of the country's English name was changed from \"Surinam\" to \"Suriname\" in January 1978, but \"Surinam\" can still be found in English. A notable example is Suriname's national airline, Surinam Airways. The older English name is reflected in the English pronunciation, or. In Dutch, the official language of Suriname, the pronunciation is, with the main stress on the third syllable and a schwa terminal vowel.\n\nHistory \n\nSettlement of Suriname dates back to 3,000 BC. The largest tribes were the Arawaks, a nomadic coastal tribe that lived from hunting and fishing. They were the first inhabitants in the area. The Caribs also settled in the area and conquered the Arawaks using their sailing ships. They settled in Galibi (Kupali Yumï, meaning \"tree of the forefathers\") on the mouth of the Marowijne River. While the larger Arawak and Carib tribes lived off the coast and savanna, smaller groups of indigenous peoples lived in the inland rainforest, such as the Akurio, Trió, Warrau, and Wayana.\n\nColonial period\n\nBeginning in the 16th century, French, Spanish, and English explorers visited the area. A century later, plantation colonies were established by the Dutch and English along the many rivers in the fertile Guiana plains. The earliest documented colony in Guiana was an English settlement named Marshall's Creek along the Suriname River. Disputes arose between the Dutch and the English. In 1667, during negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda, the Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of Suriname they had conquered from the English. The English got to keep New Amsterdam, the main city of the former colony of New Netherland. Already a cultural and economic hub in those days, they renamed it after the Duke of York: New York.\n\nIn 1683, the Society of Suriname was founded by the city of Amsterdam, the Van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck family, and the Dutch West India Company. The society was chartered to manage and defend the colony. The planters of the colony relied heavily on African slaves to cultivate the coffee, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers. Planters' treatment of the slaves was notoriously bad,  and many slaves escaped the plantations.\n\nWith the help of the native South Americans living in the adjoining rain forests, these runaway slaves established a new and unique culture that was highly successful in its own right. They were known collectively in English as the Maroons, in French as Nèg'Marrons (literally meaning \"brown negroes\", that is \"pale-skinned negroes\"), and in Dutch as Marrons.  The Maroons gradually developed several independent tribes through a process of ethnogenesis, as they were made up of slaves from different African ethnicities. Among them are the Saramaka, the Paramaka, the Ndyuka or Aukan, the Kwinti, the Aluku or Boni, and the Matawai.\n\nThe Maroons often raided the plantations to recruit new members from the slaves and capture women, as well as acquire weapons, food and supplies. The planters and their families were sometimes killed in the raids; colonists built defenses, which were so important they were shown on 18th-century maps, but these were not sufficient.  The colonists also mounted armed campaigns against the Maroons, who generally escaped through the rainforest which they knew much better than did the colonists. To end hostilities, in the 19th century the European colonial authorities signed several peace treaties with different tribes. They granted the Maroons sovereign status and trade rights in their inland territories.\n\nAbolition of slavery\n\nIn 1861-63 the Lincoln administration looked abroad for places to relocate freed slaves who wanted to leave the United States. It opened U.S. negotiations with the Dutch government regarding African American migration and colonization of the Dutch colony of Suriname in South America. Nothing came of the idea, and after 1864 the idea was dropped. \n\nSlavery in Suriname was abolished by the Netherlands in 1863, but the slaves were not fully released until 1873, after a mandatory ten-year transition period during which time they were required to work on the plantations for minimal pay. As soon as they became truly free, the slaves largely abandoned the plantations where they had worked for several generations in favour of the city, Paramaribo.\n\nAs a plantation colony, Suriname was still heavily dependent on manual labour, and to make up for the shortfall, the Dutch brought in contract labourers from the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) and India (through an arrangement with the British). In addition, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, small numbers of labourers, mostly men, were brought in from China and the Middle East. Although Suriname's population remains relatively small, because of this history it is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse countries in the world.  \n\nDecolonization\n\nOn 23 November 1941, under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, the United States occupied Suriname to protect bauxite mines.  In 1942, the Dutch government-in-exile expressed a desire to review the relations between the Netherlands and its colonies after the end of the war. In 1954, Suriname became one of the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, along with the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands. In this construction, the Netherlands retained control of defense and foreign affairs. In 1973, the local government, led by the National Party of Suriname (NPS) (a largely Creole, meaning ethnically African or mixed African-European, party) started negotiations with the Dutch government leading towards full independence, which was granted on 25 November 1975. The severance package was very substantial, and a large part of Suriname's economy for the first decade following independence was fueled by foreign aid provided by the Dutch government.\n\nIndependence\n\nThe first President of the country was Johan Ferrier, the former governor, with Henck Arron (the then leader of the NPS) as Prime Minister. In the years leading up to independence, nearly one-third of the population of Suriname emigrated to the Netherlands, amidst concern that the new country would fare worse under independence than it had as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Indeed, Surinamese politics soon degenerated into ethnic polarisation and corruption, with the NPS using Dutch aid money for partisan purposes. Its leaders were accused of fraud in the 1977 elections, in which Arron won a further term, and the discontent was such that a large chunk of the population fled to the Netherlands, joining the already significant Surinamese community there. \n\nDecember killings\n\nOn 25 February 1980, a military coup overthrew Arron's government. On 15 March 1981, and again on 12 March 1982, failed counter-coups were attempted. The first attempt was led by Wilfred Hawker and the second by Surendre Rambocus. Hawker escaped from prison during the second counter-coup attempt but was captured and executed. Between 2 am and 5 am on 7 December 1982, the military, under the leadership of Dési Bouterse, rounded up 13 prominent citizens who had criticized the military dictatorship in Suriname and brought them to Fort Zeelandia.  They were executed over the next three days, along with Rambocus and Jiwansingh Sheombar (who was also involved in the second counter-coup attempt). Bouterse, among other defendants, was tried for the murders, but the Suriname parliament extended an amnesty law in 2012 that granted Bouterse amnesty for the alleged violations before the trial was concluded. The Dutch government stated that stopping the trial was \"totally unacceptable\". \n\nElections were held in 1987, and a new constitution was adopted that, among other things, allowed Bouterse to remain in charge of the army. Dissatisfied with the government, Bouterse summarily dismissed them in 1990, by telephone. This event became popularly known as the \"Telephone Coup\". His power began to wane after the 1991 elections; an ongoing brutal civil war between the Suriname army and Maroons loyal to rebel leader Ronnie Brunswijk, begun in 1986, further weakened Bouterse's position during the 1990s. In 1999, Bouterse was convicted in absentia in the Netherlands on drug smuggling charges.\n\n21st century\n\nOn 19 July 2010, the former dictator Dési Bouterse returned to power when he was elected as the new President of Suriname.  He was re-elected in 2015.\n\nPolitics \n\nThe Republic of Suriname is a representative democratic republic, based on the Constitution of 1987. The legislative branch of government consists of a 51-member unicameral National Assembly, simultaneously and popularly elected for a five-year term.\n\nIn the most recent elections, held on Tuesday, 25 May 2010, the \"Megacombinatie\" won 23 of the National Assembly seats followed by \"Nationale Front\" with 20 seats. A much smaller number, important for coalition-building, went to the \"A‑combinatie\" and to the \"Volksalliantie\". Negotiations are ongoing between parties regarding the formation of coalitions.\n\nThe President of Suriname, who is elected for a five-year term by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly or, failing that, by a majority of the People's Assembly, heads the executive branch. If at least two-thirds of the National Assembly cannot agree to vote for one presidential candidate, a People's Assembly is formed from all National Assembly delegates and regional and municipal representatives who were elected by popular vote in the most recent national election. As head of government, the president appoints a sixteen-minister cabinet. A vice president, normally elected at the same time as the president, needs a simple majority in the National Assembly or People's Assembly to be elected for a five-year term. There is no constitutional provision for removal or replacement of the president, except in the case of resignation.\n\nThe judiciary is headed by the Court of Justice (Supreme Court). This court supervises the magistrate courts. Members are appointed for life by the president in consultation with the National Assembly, the State Advisory Council and the National Order of Private Attorneys. In April 2005, the regional Caribbean Court of Justice, based in Trinidad, was inaugurated. As the final court of appeal, it was intended to replace the London-based Privy Council.\n\nForeign relations\n\nPresident Dési Bouterse was sentenced in the Netherlands to 11 years of imprisonment for drug trafficking. He is also the main suspect in the court case concerning the 'December murders', the assassination of opponents of military rule in Fort Zeelandia, Paramaribo, in 1982. These two cases place a constraint on relations between the Netherlands and Suriname. The Dutch government has stated it will only maintain necessary contact with the president. \n\nDue to Suriname's Dutch colonial history, Suriname had a long-standing special relationship with the Netherlands. It was strained because of the coup and the Netherlands no longer maintains Suriname as a member of its development program. \n\nSince 1991, the United States has maintained positive relations with Suriname. The two countries work together through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Suriname also receives military funding from the U.S. Department of Defense. \n\nEU relations and cooperation with Suriname are carried out both on bilateral and regional basis, the latter within the framework of the ongoing EU-CELAC and EU-CARIFORUM dialogues. Suriname is party to the Cotonou Agreement, the partnership agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union. \n\nOn 17 February 2005, the leaders of Barbados and Suriname signed the \"Agreement for the deepening of bilateral cooperation between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Suriname.\"  On 23–24 April 2009, both nations formed a Joint Commission in Paramaribo, Suriname, to improve relations between both countries and to expand into various areas of cooperation.  Since the first meeting, a second one was held on 3–4 March 2011, in Dover, Barbados. At the second meeting, several areas of mutual interest were reviewed including: agriculture, trade, investment, as well as international transport. \n\nIn the late 2000s, Suriname intensified development cooperation with other developing countries. China's South-South cooperation with Suriname has included a number of large-scale infrastructure projects, including port rehabilitation and road construction. Brazil signed agreements to cooperate with Suriname in education, health, agriculture, and energy production. \n\nMilitary\n\nThe Armed Forces of Suriname have three branches: the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. The President of the Republic, Dési Bouterse, is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces (Opperbevelhebber van de Strijdkrachten). The President is assisted by the Minister of Defence. Beneath the President and Minister of Defense is the Commander of the Armed Forces (Bevelhebber van de Strijdkrachten). The Military Branches and regional Military Commands report to the Commander.\n\nAfter the creation of the Statute of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Royal Netherlands Army was entrusted with the defence of Suriname, while the defence of the Netherlands Antilles was the responsibility of the Royal Netherlands Navy. The army set up a separate Troepenmacht in Suriname (Forces in Suriname, TRIS). Upon independence in 1975, this force was turned into the Surinaamse Krijgsmacht (SKM):, Surinamese Armed Forces. On 25 February 1980, a group of 15 non-commissioned officers and one junior SKM officer, under the leadership of sergeant major Dési Bouterse, overthrew the Government. Subsequently the SKM was rebranded as Nationaal Leger (NL), National Army.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nThe country is divided into ten administrative districts, each headed by a district commissioner appointed by the president, who also has the power of dismissal. Suriname is further subdivided into 62 resorts (ressorten).\n\nGeography \n\nSuriname is the smallest independent country in South America. Situated on the Guiana Shield, it lies mostly between latitudes 1° and 6°N, and longitudes 54° and 58°W. The country can be divided into two main geographic regions. The northern, lowland coastal area (roughly above the line Albina-Paranam-Wageningen) has been cultivated, and most of the population lives here. The southern part consists of tropical rainforest and sparsely inhabited savanna along the border with Brazil, covering about 80% of Suriname's land surface.\n\nThe two main mountain ranges are the Bakhuys Mountains and the Van Asch Van Wijck Mountains. Julianatop is the highest mountain in the country at 1286 m above sea level. Other mountains include Tafelberg at 1026 m, Mount Kasikasima at 718 m, Goliathberg at 358 m and Voltzberg at 240 m.\n\nBorders\n\nSuriname is situated between French Guiana to the east and Guyana to the west. The southern border is shared with Brazil and the northern border is the Atlantic coast. The southernmost borders with French Guiana and Guyana are disputed by these countries along the Marowijne and Corantijn rivers, respectively, while a part of the disputed maritime boundary with Guyana was arbitrated by a tribunal convened under the rules set out in Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on 20 September 2007.  \n\nClimate\n\nLying 2 to 5 degrees north of the equator, Suriname has a very hot and wet tropical climate, and temperatures do not vary much throughout the year. Average relative humidity is between 80% and 90%. Its average temperature ranges from 29 to 34 degrees Celsius (84 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit). Due to the high humidity, actual temperatures are distorted and may therefore feel up to 6 degrees Celsius (11 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than the recorded temperature. The year has two wet seasons, from April to August and from November to February. It also has two dry seasons, from August to November and February to April.\n\nNature reserves\n\nLocated in the upper Coppename River watershed, the Central Suriname Nature Reserve has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unspoiled forests and biodiversity. There are many national parks in the country: Galibi National Reserve, Coppename Manding National Park, and Wia Wia National Reserve along the coast; Brownsberg Nature Park, Raleighvallen/Voltzeberg Natural Reserve, Tafelberg Nature Reserve, and Eilerts de Haan Nature Park in central Suriname; and the Sipaliwani Nature Reserve on the Brazilian border. In all, 16% of the country's land area is national parks and lakes, according to the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre. \n\nEconomy \n\nSuriname's democracy gained some strength after the turbulent 1990s, and its economy became more diversified and less dependent on Dutch financial assistance. Bauxite (aluminium ore) mining continues to be a strong revenue source, and the discovery and exploitation of oil and gold has added substantially to Suriname's economic independence. Agriculture, especially rice and bananas, remains a strong component of the economy, and ecotourism is providing new economic opportunities. More than 80% of Suriname's land-mass consists of unspoiled rain forest; with the establishment of the Central Suriname Nature Reserve in 1998, Suriname signalled its commitment to conservation of this precious resource. The Central Suriname Nature Reserve became a World Heritage Site in 2000.\n\nThe economy of Suriname is dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts for more than 15% of GDP and 70% of export earnings. Other main export products include rice, bananas and shrimp. Suriname has recently started exploiting some of its sizeable oil  and gold  reserves. About a quarter of the people work in the agricultural sector. The Surinamese economy is very dependent on commerce, its main trade partners being the Netherlands, the United States, Canada, and Caribbean countries, mainly Trinidad and Tobago and the islands of the former Netherlands Antilles. \n\nAfter assuming power in the fall of 1996, the Wijdenbosch government ended the structural adjustment program of the previous government, claiming it was unfair to the poorer elements of society. Tax revenues fell as old taxes lapsed and the government failed to implement new tax alternatives. By the end of 1997, the allocation of new Dutch development funds was frozen as Surinamese Government relations with the Netherlands deteriorated. Economic growth slowed in 1998, with decline in the mining, construction, and utility sectors. Rampant government expenditures, poor tax collection, a bloated civil service, and reduced foreign aid in 1999 contributed to the fiscal deficit, estimated at 11% of GDP. The government sought to cover this deficit through monetary expansion, which led to a dramatic increase in inflation.  It takes longer on average to register a new business in Suriname than virtually any other country in the world (694 days or about 99 weeks). \n\n* GDP (2010 est.): U.S. $4.794 billion.\n* Annual growth rate real GDP (2010 est.): 3.5%.\n* Per capita GDP (2010 est.): U.S. $9,900.\n* Inflation (2007): 6.4%.\n* Natural resources: Bauxite, gold, oil, iron ore, other minerals; forests; hydroelectric potential; fish and shrimp.\n* Agriculture: Products—rice, bananas, timber, palm kernels, coconuts, peanuts, citrus fruits, and forest products.\n* Industry: Types—alumina, oil, gold, fish, shrimp, lumber.\n* Trade:\n** Exports (2012): $2.563 billion: alumina, gold, crude oil, lumber, shrimp and fish, rice, bananas. Major consumers: US 26.1%, Belgium 17.6%, UAE 12.1%, Canada 10.4%, Guyana 6.5%, France 5.6%, Barbados 4.7%.\n** Imports (2012): $1.782 billion: capital equipment, petroleum, foodstuffs, cotton, consumer goods. Major suppliers: US 25.8%, Netherlands 15.8%, China 9.8%, UAE 7.9%, Antigua and Barbuda 7.3%, Netherlands Antilles 5.4%, Japan 4.2%.\n\nDemographics \n\nAccording to the 2012 census, Suriname had a population of 541,638 inhabitants. The Surinamese populace is characterized by its high level of diversity, wherein no particular demographic group constitutes a majority. This is a legacy of centuries of Dutch rule, which entailed successive periods of forced, contracted, or voluntary migration by various nationalities and ethnic groups from around the world.\n\nThe largest ethnic group are the East Indians, who form 27 percent of the population. They are descendants of 19th-century contract workers from India, hailing mostly from the modern Indian states of Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh along the Nepali border. Surinamese Maroons, whose ancestors are mostly runaway slaves that fled to the interior, comprise the next largest group at 21.7 percent; they are divided into five main groups: Ndyuka (Aucans), Kwinti, Matawai, Saramaccans and Paramaccans. Surinamese Creoles, mixed people descending from West African slaves and mostly Dutch Europeans, form 15.7 percent of the population. Javanese make up 14 percent of the population, and like the East Indians, descend largely from workers contracted from the island of Java in the former Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia).   13.4 percent of the population is of mixed ethnic heritage.\n\nOther sizeable groups include the Chinese, originating from 19th-century contract workers and some recent migration, who number over 40,000 ; Levantines, primarily Maronites from Lebanon, and Jews of Sephardic and Ashkenazi origin, whose center of population was the community of Jodensavanne; and Brazilians, many of them laborers mining for gold. \n\nA small but influential number of Europeans remain in the country, comprising about 1 percent of the population. They are descended mostly from Dutch 19th-century immigrant farmers, known as \"Boeroes\" (derived from boer, the Dutch word for \"farmer\"), and to a lesser degree other European groups, such as Portuguese from Madeira. Most Boeroes left after independence in 1975.\n\nVarious indigenous peoples make up 3.7 percent of the population, with the main groups being the Akurio, Arawak, Kalina (Caribs), Tiriyó and Wayana. They live mainly in the districts of Paramaribo, Wanica, Marowijne and Sipaliwini. \n\nThe vast majority of Suriname's inhabitants (about 90 percent) live in Paramaribo or on the coast.\n\nThe choice of becoming Surinamese or Dutch citizens in the years leading up to Suriname's independence in 1975 led to a mass migration to the Netherlands. This migration continued in the period immediately after independence and during military rule in the 1980s and for largely economic reasons extended throughout the 1990s. The Surinamese community in the Netherlands numbered 350,300 ; this is compared to approximately 566,000 Surinamese in Suriname itself.\n\nReligion\n\nAs with ethnicity, Suriname's religious makeup is heterogenous and reflective of the country's multicultural character. According to the 2012 census, around half of the population (48.4 percent) adhered to Christianity,;  21.6 percent of the population was Roman Catholic, 11.18 percent Pentecostal, 11.6 percent Moravian, and the remainder were of various other Protestant denominations.\n\nHindus formed the second largest religious group in Suriname, comprising 22.3 percent of the population, the largest proportion of any country in the Western Hemisphere, besides Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. Almost all practitioners of Hinduism are found among the Indo-Surinamese population. Muslims constitute 13.9 percent of the population, which is proportionally the largest in the Americas, and are found mostly among those of Javanese and to a lesser degree Indian descent.\n\nOther religious groups include Winti, an Afro-American religion practiced mostly by those of Maroon ancestry; Javanism, a syncretic faith found among some Javanese Surinamese; and various indigenous folk traditions that are often incorporated into one of the larger religions (usually Christianity). A little over 10 percent of the population is irreligious or did not state a religion.\n\nLanguages\n\n \nDutch is the sole official language, and is the language of education, government, business, and the media. Over 60% of the population speaks Dutch as a mother tongue,  and most of the rest speak it as a second language. In 2004 Suriname became an associate member of the Dutch Language Union.  It is the only Dutch-speaking country in South America as well as the only independent nation in the Americas where Dutch is spoken by a majority of the population, and one of the two non-Romance-speaking countries on the continent, the other being English-speaking Guyana.\n\nIn Paramaribo, Dutch is the main home language in two-thirds of households. The recognition of \"Surinaams-Nederlands\" (\"Surinamese Dutch\") as a national dialect equal to \"Nederlands-Nederlands\" (\"Dutch Dutch\") and \"Vlaams-Nederlands\" (\"Flemish Dutch\") was expressed in 2009 by the publication of the Woordenboek Surinaams Nederlands (Surinamese–Dutch Dictionary).  Only in the interior of Suriname is Dutch seldom spoken.\n\nSranan, a local creole language originally spoken by the creole population group, is the most widely used language in the streets and is often used interchangeably with Dutch depending on the formality of the setting.\n\nSurinamese Hindi or Sarnami, a dialect of Bhojpuri, is the third-most used language, spoken by the descendants of South Asian contract workers from then British India. Javanese is used by the descendants of Javanese contract workers. The Maroon languages, somewhat intelligible with Sranan, include Saramaka, Paramakan, Ndyuka (also called Aukan), Kwinti and Matawai. Amerindian languages, spoken by Amerindians, include Carib and Arawak. Hakka and Cantonese are spoken by the descendants of the Chinese contract workers. Mandarin is spoken by some few recent Chinese immigrants. English and Portuguese are also used.\n\nThe public discourse about Suriname's languages is a part of an ongoing debate about the country's national identity. The use of the popular Sranan became associated with nationalist politics after its public use by former dictator Dési Bouterse in the 1980s, and groups descended from escaped slaves might resent it. Some propose to change the national language to English, so as to improve links to the Caribbean and North America, or to Spanish, as a nod to Suriname's location in South America, although it has no Spanish-speaking neighbours.\n\nLargest cities\n\nThe national capital, Paramaribo, is by far the dominant urban area, accounting for nearly half of Suriname's population and most of its urban residents; indeed, its population is greater than the next nine largest cities combined. Most municipalities are located within the capital's metropolitan area, or along the densely populated coastline.\n\nCulture \n\nOwing to the country's multicultural heritage, Suriname celebrates a variety of distinct ethnic and religious festivals.\n\nNational holidays\n\n* 1 January – New Year's Day\n* 6 January – Three Kings Day\n* January – World Religion Day\n* February – Chinese New Year\n* 25 February – Day of the Revolution\n* March (varies) – Holi\n* March/April – Good Friday\n* March/April – Easter\n* 1 May – Labour Day\n* May/June – Ascension day\n* 5 June – Indian Arrival Day\n* 1 July – Keti Koti (Emancipation Day - end of slavery)\n* 8 August – Javanese Arrival Day\n* 9 August – Indigenous People's Day\n* 20 October – Chinese Arrival day\n* 25 November – Independence Day\n* 25 December – Christmas\n* 26 December – Boxing Day\n\nThere are several Hindu and Islamic national holidays like Diwali (deepavali), Phagwa and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-adha. These holidays do not have specific dates on the Gregorian calendar, as they are based on the Hindu and Islamic calendars, respectively.\n\nThere are several holidays which are unique to Suriname. These include the Indian, Javanese and Chinese arrival days. They celebrate the arrival of the first ships with their respective immigrants.\n\nNew Year's Eve\n\nNew Year's Eve in Suriname is called Oud jaar, or \"old year\". It is during this period that the Surinamese population goes to the city's commercial district to watch \"demonstrational fireworks\". The bigger stores invest in these firecrackers and display them out in the streets. Every year the length of them is compared, and high praises are given for the company that has imported the largest ribbon.\n\nThese celebrations start at 10 in the morning and finish the next day. The day is usually filled with laughter, dance, music, and drinking. When the night starts, the big street parties are already at full capacity. The most popular fiesta is the one that is held at café 't Vat in the main tourist district. The parties there stop between 10 and 11 at night, after which people go home to light their pagaras (red-firecracker-ribbons) at midnight.\nAfter 12, the parties continue and the streets fill again until daybreak. \n\nSports\n\nThe Suriname Olympic Committee is the national governing body for sports in Suriname. The SOC was established in 1959 and now has 17 members: Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Boxing, Chess, Cycling, Football, Judo, Karate, Shooting, Swimming, Table Tennis, Taekwondo, Tennis, Triathlon, Volleyball, and Wrestling.\n\nOne of the major sports in Suriname is football.  Many Suriname-born players and Dutch-born players of Surinamese descent, like Gerald Vanenburg, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf, Andwélé Slory, Ryan Babel, Aron Winter, Patrick Kluivert, Romeo Castelen, and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink turned out to play for Oranje. In 1999, Humphrey Mijnals, who played for both Suriname and the Netherlands, was elected Surinamese footballer of the century.  Another famous player is André Kamperveen, who captained Suriname in the 1940s and was the first Surinamese to play professionally in the Netherlands.\n\nThe most famous international track & field athlete from Suriname is Letitia Vriesde, who won a silver medal at the 1995 World Championships behind Ana Quirot in the 800 metres, the first medal won by a South American female athlete in World Championship competition. In addition, she also won a bronze medal at the 2001 World Championships and won several medals in the 800 and 1500 metres at the Pan-American Games and Central American and Caribbean Games. Tommy Asinga also received acclaim for winning a bronze medal in the 800 metres at the 1991 Pan American Games.\n\nSwimmer Anthony Nesty is the only Olympic medalist for Suriname. He won gold in the 100-meter butterfly at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and he won bronze in the same discipline at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Originally from Trinidad and Tobago, he now lives in Gainesville, Florida, and is the coach of the University of Florida, mainly coaching distance swimmers.\n\nCricket is popular in Suriname to some extent, influenced by its popularity in the Netherlands and in neighbouring Guyana. The Surinaamse Cricket Bond is an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Suriname and Argentina are the only ICC associates in South America, although Guyana is represented on the West Indies Cricket Board, a full member. The national cricket team was ranked 47th in the world and sixth in the ICC Americas region as of June 2014, and competes in the World Cricket League (WCL) and ICC Americas Championship. Iris Jharap, born in Paramaribo, played women's One Day International matches for the Dutch national side, the only Surinamer to do so. \n\nIn the sport of badminton the local heroes are Virgil Soeroredjo & Mitchel Wongsodikromo and also Crystal Leefmans. All winning medals for Suriname at the Carebaco Caribbean Championships, the Central American and Caribbean Games (CACSO Games)  and also at the South American Games, better known as the ODESUR Games. Virgil Soeroredjo also participated for Suriname at the 2012 London Summer Olympics, only the second badminton player, after Oscar Brandon, for Suriname to achieve this. \n\nMultiple K-1 champion and legend, Ernesto Hoost, is from Surinamese descent. Rayen Simson, another legendary multiple world champion kickboxer, was born in Suriname. Remy Bonjasky also a multiple K-1 champion was also born in Suriname. MMA and Kickboxing champions Melvin Manhoef, Gilbert Yvel were born in Suriname or from Surinamese descent. Retired female kickboxer Ilonka Elmont was also born in Suriname. Another notable up and comer kickboxer and K-1 fighter, Tyrone Spong, was born in Suriname. Ginty Vrede, a former Muay Thai Heavy Weight Champion who died in 2008 aged 22, was born in Suriname.\n\nInvolving the sport of tennis, historic national champions include Gerard van der Schroeff (men's single national champion for 10 consecutive years between the years 1931–1941, plus champion of multiple future titles). Herman Tjin-A-Djie (men's national champion 1941 and 1945, plus men's national double champion for 10 consecutive years with his brother Leo). Leo Tjin-A-Djie (between 1948–1957 he was 8 times national champion and men's national double champion for 10 consecutive years with his brother Herman).From Leo spawned the Opa Leo Tjin-A-Djie Tennis tournament. Randolf Tjin-A-Djie was national champion for 1960. \n\nTransportation\n\nSuriname and neighboring Guyana are the only two countries on the mainland South American continent that drive on the left. In Guyana, this practice is inherited from United Kingdom colonial authorities. Various reasons are given to explain why Suriname drives on the left. It is thought that it is because the first cars imported were from England, but this is yet undocumented. In addition, this view does not say anything about traffic before the automobile era. Another explanation is that the Netherlands, at the time of its colonization of Suriname, used the left-hand side of the road for traffic,  and yet another is that Suriname was first colonized by the English.  Although the Netherlands converted to driving to the right at the end of the 18th century,  Suriname did not. Writers Peter Kincaid and Ian Watson suggest that in territories such as Suriname where there are no connecting roads to neighbouring countries, there is no external pressure to change the status quo.\n\nAir \n\nAirlines with departures from Suriname:\n* Blue Wing Airlines\n* Caribbean Commuter Airways (Caricom Airways) (Surinam Airways Commuter)\n* Gum Air\n* Surinam Airways (SLM)\n\nAirlines with arrivals in Suriname:\n* Caribbean Airlines (Trinidad & Tobago)\n* Dutch Antilles Express (DAE) (Curaçao)\n* Insel Air (Curaçao)\n* Insel Air Aruba (Aruba)\n* KLM (Netherlands)\n* Surinam Airways (SLM) (Aruba, Brazil (Belem), Curaçao, Guyana (Georgetown), Netherlands (Amsterdam), Trinidad & Tobago (Port of Spain), & USA (Miami).)\n\nOther national companies with an air operator certification:\n\n* Aero Club Suriname (ACS) – General Aviation Aeroclub\n* Coronie Aero Farmers (CAF) – Agriculture Cropdusting\n* Eagle Air Services (EAS) – Agriculture Cropdusting\n* ERK Farms (ERK) – Agriculture Cropdusting\n* Hi-Jet Helicopter Services (HI-Jet) Helicopter Charters\n* Kuyake Aviation (Part of Caricom Airways) – General Aviation Flightschool\n* Overeem Air Service (OAS) – General Aviation Charters\n* Pegasus Air Service (PAS) – Helicopter Charters\n* Suriname Air Force / Surinaamse Luchtmacht (SAF / LUMA) – Military Aviation Surinam Air Force\n* Surinam Sky Farmers (SSF) – Agriculture Cropdusting\n* Surinaamse Medische Zendings Vliegdienst (MAF – Mission Aviation Fellowship) – General Aviation Missionary\n* Vortex Aviation Suriname (VAS) – General Aviation Maintenance & Flightschool\n\nHealth\n\nThe fertility rate was at 2.6 births per woman.  Public expenditure was at 3.6% of the GDP in 2004, whereas private expenditure was at 4.2%. There were 45 physicians per 100,000 in the early 2000s. Infant mortality was at 30 per 1,000 live births. Male life expectancy at birth was at 66.4 years, whereas female life expectancy at birth was at 73 years.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation in Suriname is compulsory until the age of 12,  and the nation had a net primary enrollment rate of 94% in 2004. Literacy is very common, particularly among males. The main university in the country is the Anton de Kom University of Suriname.\n\nFrom elementary school to high school there are 13 grades. The elementary school has six grades, middle school four grades and high school three grades. Students take a test in the end of elementary school to determine whether they will go to the MULO (secondary modern school) or a middle school of lower standards like LBGO. Students from the elementary school wear a green shirt with jeans, while middle school students wear a blue shirt with jeans.\n\nStudents going from the second grade of middle school to the third grade have to choose between the business or science courses. This will determine what their major subjects will be. In order to go on to study math and physics, the student must have a total of 13 points. If the student has fewer points, he/she will go into the business courses or fail the grade.\n\nBiodiversity \n\nIn October 2013, 16 international scientists researching the ecosystems during a three-week expedition in Suriname's Upper Palumeu River Watershed catalogued 1,378 species and found 60—including six frogs, one snake, and 11 fish—that may be previously unknown species.     According to the environmental non-profit Conservation International, which funded the expedition, Suriname's ample supply of fresh water is vital to the biodiversity and healthy ecosystems of the region. \n\nSuriname is said to be the only region where one variety of snakewood (Brosimum guianense), a rare shrub-like tree, is found. The harvesting of snakewood is restricted and the wood is expensive, being sold by the ounce in some instances.\n\nEnvironmental preservation \n\nOn 21 March 2013, Suriname's REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP 2013) was approved by the member countries of the Participants Committee of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF).  Member countries include Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, UK, United States and the European Commission. \n\nMedia \n\nA popular newspaper is De Ware Tijd, however Times of Suriname surpassed De Ware Tijd as most read newspaper. The most popular source for sports news in SMEsport.  The only fully English online newspaper is Devsur: Development of Suriname.  The most popular online newspapers are Starnieuws   and Suriname Nieuws.  Suriname has twenty-four radio stations, two broadcast through the Internet (Apintie and Radio10). There are twelve television sources: TV2(Ch.2), ABC(Ch.4), RBN(Ch.5), STVS(Ch.8), Apintie(Ch.10), ATV(Ch.12), Radika(Ch.14), SCCN(Ch.17), Trishul(Ch. 20), Garuda(Ch.23), Sangeetmala(Ch.26), PL(Ch.28), Ch.30, Ch.32, Ch.38, SCTV(Ch.45), Ch.47, Mustika(Ch.50) And Ch.52. Also listened to is mArt, a broadcaster from Amsterdam founded by people from Suriname. Kondreman is one of the popular cartoons in Suriname.\n\nIn 2012, Suriname was ranked joint 22nd with Japan in the worldwide Press Freedom Index by the organization Reporters Without Borders.  This was ahead of the US (47th), the UK (28th), and France (38th).\n\nTourism \n\nThe hotel industry is important to Suriname's economy. The rental of apartments, or the rent-a-house phenomenon, is also popular in Suriname.\n\nMost tourists visit Suriname for the outstanding biodiversity of the pristine Amazonian rain forests in the south of the country, which are noted for their flora and fauna. The Central Suriname Nature Reserve is the biggest and one of the most popular reserves, along with the Brownsberg Nature Park which overlooks the Brokopondo Reservoir, the latter being one of the largest man-made lakes in the world. Tonka Island in the reservoir is home to a rustic eco-tourism project run by the Saramaccaner Maroons.  Pangi wraps and bowls made of calabashes are the two main products manufactured for tourists. The Maroons have learned that colorful and ornate pangis are popular with tourists.  Other popular decorative souvenirs are hand-carved purple-hardwood made into bowls, plates, canes, wooden boxes, and wall decors.\n\nThere are also many waterfalls throughout the country. Raleighvallen, or Raleigh Falls, is a 56000 ha nature reserve on the Coppename River, rich in bird life. Also are the Blanche Marie Falls on the Nickerie River and the Wonotobo Falls. Tafelberg Mountain in the centre of the country is surrounded by its own reserve – the Tafelberg Nature Reserve – around the source of the Saramacca River, as is the Voltzberg Nature Reserve further north on the Coppename River at Raleighvallen. In the interior are many Maroon and Amerindian villages, many of which have their own reserves that are generally open to visitors.\n\nSuriname is one of the few countries in the world where at least one of each biome that the state possesses has been declared a wildlife reserve. Around 30% of the total land area of Suriname is protected by law as reserves.\n\nOther attractions include plantations such as Laarwijk, which is situated along the Suriname River. This plantation can be reached only by boat via Domburg, in the north central Wanica District of Suriname.\n\nLandmarks\n\nThe Jules Wijdenbosch Bridge is a bridge over the river Suriname between Paramaribo and Meerzorg in the Commewijne district. The bridge was built during the tenure of President Jules Albert Wijdenbosch (1996–2000) and was completed in 2000. The bridge is 52 m high, and 1504 m long. It connects Paramaribo with Commewijne, a connection which previously could only be made by ferry. The purpose of the bridge was to facilitate and promote the development of the eastern part of Suriname. The bridge consists of two lanes (one lane each way) and is not accessible to pedestrians.\n\nThe construction of the Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral started on 13 January 1883. Before it became a cathedral it was a theatre. The theatre was built in 1809 and burned down in 1820.\n\nIn between the cathedral and the Presidential Palace is the popular palm garden Palmentuin.\n\nSuriname is one of the few countries in the world where a synagogue is located next to a mosque. \nThe two buildings are located next to each other in the centre of Paramaribo and have been known to share a parking facility during their respective religious rites, should they happen to coincide with one another.\n\nA relatively new landmark is the Hindu Arya Dewaker temple in the Johan Adolf Pengelstraat in Wanica, Paramaribo, which was inaugurated in 2001. A special characteristic of the temple is that it does not have images of the Hindu divinities, as they are forbidden in the Arya Samaj, the Hindu movement to which the people who built the temple belong. Instead, the building is covered by many texts derived from the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures. The beautiful architecture makes the temple a tourist attraction.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Arya Dewaker, exterior5.jpg|Arya Dewaker Temple\nFile:Brugboot3.jpg|Jules Wijdenbosch Bridge.\nFile:Synagoge next to a mosque.JPG|Mosque next to a synagogue in Paramaribo.\nFile: Paramaribo Palmentuin.jpg|Palmentuin (Palm Garden)",
                "The history of Suriname dates from 3000 BCE when Native Americans first inhabited the area. Present-day Suriname is the home to many distinct indigenous cultures. The largest tribes were the Arawaks, a nomadic coastal tribe that lived from hunting and fishing, and the Caribs. The Arawaks were the first inhabitants of Suriname; later, the Caribs arrived, and conquered the Arawaks using their sailing ships.   They settled in Galibi (Kupali Yumï, meaning \"tree of the forefathers\") on the mouth of the Marowijne river. While the larger Arawak and Carib tribes lived off the coast and savanna, smaller groups of indigenous peoples lived in the rainforest inland, such as the Akurio, Trió, Warrau, and Wayana.\n\nEuropean colonization \n\nEnglish colonization \n\nThe first Europeans who came to Suriname were Dutch traders who visited the area along with other parts of South America's 'Wild Coast.' The first attempts to settle the area by Europeans was in 1630, when English settlers led by Captain Marshall attempted to found a colony.  They cultivated crops of tobacco, but the venture failed financially.\n\nWilloughbyland \n\nIn 1650 Lord Willoughby, the governor of Barbados, furnished out a vessel to settle a colony in Suriname. At his own cost he equipped a ship of 20 guns, and two smaller vessels with things necessary for the support of the plantation.  Major Anthony Rowse settled there in his name. Two years later, for the better settling of the colony, he went in person, fortified and furnished it with things requisite for defence and trade. 'Willoughbyland' consisted of around 30000 acre and a fort. In 1663 most of the work on the ca. 50 plantations was done by native Indians and 3,000 African slaves.  There were around 1,000 whites there, joined by Brazilian Jews, attracted by religious freedom which was granted to all the settlers by the English.\n\nDutch colonization \n\nThe settlement was invaded by seven Dutch ships (from the Zeeland region), led by Abraham Crijnssen, on 26 February 1667. Fort Willoughby was captured the next day after a three-hour fight  and renamed Fort Zeelandia. On 31 July 1667, the English and Dutch signed the Treaty of Breda, in which for the time being the status quo was respected: the Dutch could keep occupying Suriname and the British the formerly Dutch colony New Amsterdam (modern-day New York). Willoughbyland was renamed Suriname. This arrangement was made official in the Treaty of Westminster of 1674, after the British had regained and again lost Suriname in 1667 and the Dutch regained the colony in 1668. In 1683 the Society of Suriname was set up, modelled on the ideas of Jean-Baptiste Colbert to profit from the management and defence of the Dutch Republic's colony. It had three participants, with equal shares in the society's responsibilities and profits—the city of Amsterdam, the family Van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck, and the Dutch West India Company. The Van Aerssen family only managed to sell its share in 1770. The Society came to an end in 1795 when this kind of trade and business was no longer seen as acceptable.\n\nSlavery and emancipation \n\nIn South America, slavery was the norm.  The native people proved to be in limited supply and consequently the Atlantic slave trade supplied the workforce for the plantations.  The plantations were producing sugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton which were exported for the Amsterdam market. In 1713 for instance most of the work on the 200 plantations was done by 13,000 African slaves. Their treatment was bad, and slaves periodically escaped to the jungle from the start.   These Maroons (also known as \"Djukas\" or \"Bakabusi Nengre\") attacked the plantations in order to acquire goods that were in short supply and to acquire women. Notable leaders of the Surinam Maroons were Alabi, Boni, Joli-coeur and Broos (Captain Broos). In the 18th century, three of the Maroon people signed a peace treaty, similar to the peace treaty ending the First Maroon War in Jamaica, whereby they were recognised as free people and received a yearly tribute that provided them with the goods they used to \"liberate\" from the plantations.  A contemporary description of the war between the Maroons and the plantation owners in Suriname can be found in Narrative of a Five Years Expedition Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam by John Gabriel Stedman.\n\nSuriname was occupied by the British in 1799, after the Netherlands were incorporated by France, and was returned to the Dutch in 1816, after the defeat of Napoleon. The Dutch abolished slavery only in 1863, although the British had already abolished it during their short rule. The slaves were, however, not released until 1873; up to that date they conducted obligatory but paid work at the plantations. In the meantime, many more workers had been imported from the Dutch East Indies, mostly Chinese inhabitants of that colony, creating a Chinese Surinamese population.  From 1873 to 1916, many laborers were imported from India, creating the Indo-Surinamese. After 1916, many laborers were again imported from the Dutch East Indies, especially Java, creating the Javanese Surinamese.\n\nTwentieth century \n\nIn the 20th century, the natural resources of Suriname, rubber, gold and bauxite, were exploited. The US company Alcoa had a claim on a large area in Suriname where bauxite, from which aluminum can be made, was found. Given that the peace treaties with the Maroon people granted them title to the lands, there have been international court cases that negated the right of the Surinam government to grant these claims. On November 23, 1941, under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, the United States occupied Dutch Guiana to protect the bauxite mines. \n\nDecolonization \n\nIn 1945, the first full election was held, with the Netherlands providing aid in health matters.\n\nIn 1954, Suriname gained self-government, with the Netherlands retaining control of defence and foreign affairs.\n\nIndependence \n\nIn 1973 the Dutch government started independence negotiations with the local government, led by the NPS (a largely Creole party), which was granted on November 25, 1975. The Dutch instituted an aid programme worth US$1.5 billion to last till 1985. The first President of the country was Johan Ferrier, with Henck Arron (leader of the NPS) as Prime Minister. Roughly a third of the population emigrated to the Netherlands prior to independence, fearing that the new country would not be viable. \n\nIn 1980, the government of Henck Arron was overthrown in a military coup led by Sergeant-Major Dési Bouterse. President Ferrier refused to recognise the new government, appointing Henk Chin A Sen (of the Nationalist Republican Party). Another coup followed five months later, with the army replacing Ferrier with Chin A Sen. These developments were largely welcomed by a population that expected the new army-installed government to put an end to corruption and improve the standard of living. This was despite the fact that the new regime banned opposition parties and became increasingly dictatorial. The Dutch initially accepted the new government; however, relations between Suriname and the Netherlands collapsed when 15 members of the political opposition were killed by the army on December 8, 1982, in Fort Zeelandia. This event is also known as the December murders (Decembermoorden in Dutch). The Dutch and Americans cut off their aid in protest at the move.\n\nIn 1985, the ban on opposition parties was lifted, and work began on devising a new constitution. The following year saw the start of an anti-government rebellion of the Maroons in the interior, calling themselves the Jungle Commando and led by Ronnie Brunswijk. The Bouterse government violently tried to suppress the insurgency by burning villages and other similar means. Many Maroons fled to French Guiana."

A pascal is the force of one newton acting on a surface area of one square meter. It is the unit of pressure designated by the International System. l00,OOO Pa= 1000mb 1 bar.\nBlaise Pascal - Biography\nBlaise Pascal was born at Clermont on June 19, 1623, and died at Paris on Aug. 19, 1662. His father, a local judge and tax collector at Clermont, and himself of some scientific reputation, moved to Paris in 1631, partly to prosecute his own scientific studies, partly to carry on the education of his only son, who had already displayed exceptional ability.\nBlaise Pascal was kept at home in order to ensure his not being overworked, and with the same object it was directed that his education should be at first confined to the study of languages, and should not include any mathematics. This naturally excited the boy's curiosity, and one day, being then twelve years old, he asked in what geometry consisted. His tutor replied that it was the science of constructing exact figures and of determining the proportions between their different parts. Blaise Pascal, stimulated no doubt by the injunction against reading it, gave up his play-time to this new study, and in a few weeks had discovered for himself many properties of figures, and in particular the proposition that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles.\nAt the age of fourteen Blaise Pascal was admitted to the weekly meetings of Roberval, Mersenne, Mydorge, and other French geometricians; from which, ultimately, the French Academy sprung. At sixteen Blaise Pascal wrote an essay on conic sections; and in 1641, at the age of eighteen, he constructed the first arithmetical machine, an instrument which, eight years later, he further improved. His correspondence with Fermat about this time shews that he was then turning his attention to analytical geometry and physics. He repeated Torricelli's experiments, by which the pressure of the atmosphere could be estimated as a weight, and he confirmed his theory of the cause of barometrical variations by obtaining at the same instant readings at different altitudes on the hill of Puy-de-Dôme.\nIn 1650, when in the midst of these researches, Blaise Pascal suddenly abandoned his favorite pursuits to study religion, or, as he says in his Pensées, \"contemplate the greatness and the misery of man''; and about the same time he persuaded the younger of his two sisters to enter the Port Royal society.\nIn 1653, Blaise Pascal had to administer his father's estate. He now took up his old life again, and made several experiments on the pressure exerted by gases and liquids; it was also about this period that he invented the arithmetical triangle, and together with Fermat created the calculus of probabilities. He was meditating marriage when an accident again turned the current of his thoughts to a religious life. He was driving a four-in-hand on November 23, 1654, when the horses ran away; the two leaders dashed over the parapet of the bridge at Neuilly, and Blaise Pascal was saved only by the traces breaking. Always somewhat of a mystic, he considered this a special summons to abandon the world. He wrote an account of the accident on a small piece of parchment, which for the rest of his life he wore next to his heart, to perpetually remind him of his covenant; and shortly moved to Port Royal, where he continued to live until his death in 1662. Constitutionally delicate, he had injured his health by his incessant study; from the age of seventeen or eighteen he suffered from insomnia and acute dyspepsia, and at the time of his death was physically worn out.\nPascal Language\nBlaise Pascal's contribution to computing was recognized by computer scientist Nicklaus Wirth, who in 1972 named his new computer language Pascal (and insisted that it be spelled Pascal, not PASCAL).\nPrev",
                "All Elementary Mathematics - Online Mathematical School - Great Mathematicians - Pascal\n \nPASCAL\nBlaise Pascal (1623 пїЅ 1662), was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer and Catholic philosopher. He was a child prodigy   who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen. Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made   important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalizing the work of Evangelista   Torricelli. Pascal also wrote in defense of the scientific method. In 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on   calculating machines, and after three years of effort and 50 prototypes he invented the mechanical calculator. He built twenty of these   machines (called \"Pascal's calculator\" and later \"pascaline\") in the following ten years. Pascal was an important mathematician, helping   create two major new areas of research: he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of sixteen, and   later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science.   Following Galileo and Torricelli, in 1646 he refuted Aristotle's followers who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum. Pascal's results caused   many disputes before being accepted.\nHis father died in 1651. Following a mystical experience in late 1654, he had his \"second conversion\", abandoned his scientific work, and   devoted himself to philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pensees, the   former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. In this year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle.   Between 1658 and 1659 he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids.\nPascal had poor health especially after his eighteenth year and his death came just two months after his 39th birthday.\nPascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand; he lost his mother at the age of three. His father, Etienne Pascal, who also had an interest in science   and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the \"Noblesse de Robe\". In 1631, five years after the death of his wife, Etienne Pascal moved   with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the   family. Etienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability,   particularly his son Blaise. The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science.\nParticularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues' thinking, the sixteen-year-old Pascal   produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the \"Mystic Hexagram\", Essai pour les coniques (\"Essay on Conics\") and   sent it пїЅ his first serious work of mathematics пїЅ to Pere Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascal's theorem. It states that if   a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line).         Pascal's work was so precocious that Descartes was convinced that Pascal's father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed,   the product of the son not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: \"I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about   conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,\" adding, \"but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely   occur to a sixteen-year-old child\".\nPascal continued to influence mathematics throughout his life. His \"Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle\" of 1653 described a convenient   tabular presentation for binomial coefficients, now called \"Pascal's triangle\".\nIn 1654, prompted by a friend interested in gambling problems, he corresponded with Fermat on the subject, and from that collaboration was   born the mathematical theory of probabilities. The friend was the Chevalier de Mere, and the specific problem was that of two players who   want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly, based on the chance each has   of winning the game from that point. From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later (in the Pensees) used a   probabilistic argument, Pascal's Wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of   probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz' formulation of the infinitesimal calculus. After a religious experience in 1654, Pascal   mostly gave up work in mathematics.\nPascal's work in the fields of the study of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions   include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on   the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water   and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as   Pascal's barrel experiment. By 1646, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli's experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an   experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury   in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a vacuum, some   invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible;   and that this substance was forever in motion. Furthermore, \"Everything that is in motion must be moved by something,\"  Aristotle declared.   Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal's time, a vacuum was an impossibility. How so? As proof it was pointed out:\nпїЅ Light passed through the so-called \"vacuum\" in the glass tube.\nпїЅ Aristotle wrote how everything moved, and must be moved by something.\nпїЅ Therefore, since there had to be an invisible \"something\" to move the light through the glass tube, there was no vacuum in the tube. Not in   the glass tube or anywhere else. Vacuums пїЅ the absence of any and everything пїЅ were simply an impossibility.\nFollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced \"New Experiments with the Vacuum\", which detailed basic rules describing   to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of   liquid in a barometer tube.\nOn 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, Florin Perier, husband of Pascal's elder sister, was   finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by Perier, reads: \"The weather was chancy   last Saturday...[but] around five o'clock that morning...the Puy-de-Dome was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people   of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work...\"   at eight o'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured sixteen pounds of    quicksilver...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the   other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26\" and 3? lines above the quicksilver in the   vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time... \"I attached   one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if   any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy-de-Dome,   about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23\" and 2 lines...I   repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case...\"\nPascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie,   a height of about fifty meters. The mercury dropped two lines.\nIn the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascal's empty space, Pascal, in his reply to Estienne Noel, gave one of   the seventeenth century's major statements on the scientific method, which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by Karl Popper   that scientific theories are characterised by their falsifiability: \"In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that   all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its   falsity. \"His insistence on the existence of the vacuum also led to conflict with other prominent scientistsпїЅ, including Descartes.\nPascal introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in the 17th century in his search for a perpetual motion machine.\nIn honor of his scientific contributions, the name Pascal has been given to the SI unit of pressure, to a programming language, and Pascal's   law (an important principle of hydrostatics), and as mentioned above, Pascal's triangle and Pascal's wager still bear his name.\nPascal's development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling, today it is   extremely important in economics, especially in actuarial science. John Ross writes, \"Probability theory and the discoveries following it   changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual's and society's ability to influence the course of future   events\". However, it should be noted that Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the   field very far. Christiaan Huygens, learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject.   Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace.",

[8]\nContents\n10 External links\nEarly life and education[ edit ]\nPascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand , which is in France's Auvergne region . He lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three. [9] His father, Étienne Pascal (1588–1651), who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the \" Noblesse de Robe \". Pascal had two sisters, the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte.\nIn 1631, five years after the death of his wife, [10] Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris.

In 1631 Étienne sold his position as second president of the Cour des Aides for 65,665 livres . [12] The money was invested in a government bond which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years' War , defaulted on the government's bonds. Suddenly Étienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.\nAn early Pascaline on display at the Musée des Arts et Métiers , Paris\nLike so many others, Étienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu , leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time, Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen —a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.\nIn 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal's calculator or the Pascaline . Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden , Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators. [13] Though these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering , the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a status symbol , for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design.\nContributions to mathematics[ edit ]\nPascal's triangle . Each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle demonstrates many mathematical properties in addition to showing binomial coefficients .\nPascal continued to influence mathematics throughout his life. His Traité du triangle arithmétique (\"Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle\") of 1653 described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients , now called Pascal's triangle . The triangle can also be represented:\n0\n \n{\\displaystyle t_{mn}={\\frac {(m+n)(m+n-1)\\cdots (m+1)}{n(n-1)\\cdots 1}}.\\ }\nIn 1654 he proved Pascal's identity relating the sums of the p-th powers of the first n positive integers for p = 0, 1, 2, …, k. [14]\nIn 1654, prompted by his friend the Chevalier de Méré , he corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on the subject of gambling problems, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities . [15] The specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly , based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later (in the Pensées) used a probabilistic argument, Pascal's Wager , to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz ' formulation of the calculus . [16]\nAfter a religious experience in 1654, Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics.\nPhilosophy of mathematics[ edit ]\nPascal's major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his De l'Esprit géométrique (\"Of the Geometrical Spirit\"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous \" Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal \" (\"Little Schools of Port-Royal\"). The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.\nPascal also used De l'Esprit géométrique to develop a theory of definition . He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism . Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes.\nIn De l'Art de persuader (\"On the Art of Persuasion\"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's axiomatic method , specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.\nContributions to the physical sciences[ edit ]\nPortrait of Pascal\nAn illustration of the (apocryphal) Pascal's barrel experiment\nPascal's work in the fields of the study of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids . His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe . He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal's barrel experiment.\nBy 1646, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli 's experimentation with barometers . Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a vacuum , some invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and that this substance was forever in motion. Furthermore, \"Everything that is in motion must be moved by something,\" Aristotle declared. [17] Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal's time, a vacuum was an impossibility. How so? As proof it was pointed out:\nLight passed through the so-called \"vacuum\" in the glass tube.\nAristotle wrote how everything moved, and must be moved by something.\nTherefore, since there had to be an invisible \"something\" to move the light through the glass tube, there was no vacuum in the tube. Not in the glass tube or anywhere else. Vacuums – the absence of any and everything – were simply an impossibility.\nFollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide (\"New Experiments with the Vacuum\"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube.\nOn 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, Florin Périer , husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by Périer, reads:\nThe weather was chancy last Saturday...[but] around five o'clock that morning...the Puy-de-Dôme was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work...\n...at eight o'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured 16 pounds of quicksilver ...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26\" and 3½ lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time...\nI attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy-de-Dôme , about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23\" and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case... [18]\nPascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie , a height of about 50 metres. The mercury dropped two lines.\nIn the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascal's empty space, Pascal, in his reply to Estienne Noel , gave one of the 17th century's major statements on the scientific method, which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by Karl Popper that scientific theories are characterised by their falsifiability : \"In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.\" [19] His insistence on the existence of the vacuum also led to conflict with other prominent scientists, including Descartes.\nPascal introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine. [20]\nAdult life, religion, philosophy, and literature[ edit ]\nFor after all what is man in nature? A nothing in relation to infinity, all in relation to nothing, a central point between nothing and all and infinitely far from understanding either. The ends of things and their beginnings are impregnably concealed from him in an impenetrable secret. He is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness out of which he was drawn and the infinite in which he is engulfed.\nBlaise Pascal, Pensées No. 72\nPascal studying the cycloid , by Augustin Pajou , 1785, Louvre\nIn the winter of 1646, Pascal's 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal \"would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...\" [21] But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become household guests.\nBoth men were followers of Jean Guillebert , proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as Jansenism . This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous Augustinism . Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and upon his successful treatment of Étienne, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of \"first conversion\" and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.\nPascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his \"worldly period\" (1648–54). His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as her conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal . Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he too needed her.\nSuddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn't work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise's fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind. [22]\nBy the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother. Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, \"He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...\" [23] In early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline, Pascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, \"had begun to smell like a cult.\" [24] With two thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29-year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty.\nFor a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God. [25]\nBrush with death[ edit ]\n[ dubious – discuss ]\nOn 23 November 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious vision and immediately recorded the experience in a brief note to himself which began: \"Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...\" and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: \"I will not forget thy word. Amen.\" He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. [26] This piece is now known as the Memorial. The story of the carriage accident[ clarification needed ] as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars. [27] His belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the Provincial Letters.\nThe Provincial Letters[ edit ]\ne\nBeginning in 1656, Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry , a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period (especially the Jesuits , and in particular Antonio Escobar ). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins . The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV . The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the formulary controversy , the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied Alexander VII himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments.\nAside from their religious influence, the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau .\nCharles Perrault wrote of the Letters: \"Everything is there—purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an agrément not to be found anywhere else.\" [28]\nMain article: Pensées\nPascal's most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the Pensées (\"Thoughts\"), was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title Apologie de la religion Chrétienne (\"Defense of the Christian Religion\"). The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets (\"Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects\") and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the Apologie's main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of skepticism and stoicism , personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.\nPascal's Pensées is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose. When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language. [29] Will Durant hailed it as \"the most eloquent book in French prose\". [30] In Pensées, Pascal surveys several philosophical paradoxes: infinity and nothing, faith and reason, soul and matter, death and life, meaning and vanity – seemingly arriving at no definitive conclusions besides humility, ignorance, and grace. Rolling these into one he develops Pascal's Wager .\nLast works and death[ edit ]\nPascal's epitaph in Saint-Étienne-du-Mont , where he was buried\nT. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as \"a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world.\" Pascal's ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, \"Sickness is the natural state of Christians.\" [31]\nLouis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, Écrit sur la signature du formulaire (\"Writ on the Signing of the Form\"), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism . Pascal's last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line, moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats.\nIn 1662, Pascal's illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister's death. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction . He died the next morning, his last words being \"May God never abandon me,\" and was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont . [31]\nAn autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with damage to his brain . Despite the autopsy, the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on tuberculosis , stomach cancer , or a combination of the two. [32] The headaches which afflicted Pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion .\nDeath mask of Blaise Pascal.\nIn honour of his scientific contributions, the name Pascal has been given to the SI unit of pressure , to a programming language , and Pascal's law (an important principle of hydrostatics), and as mentioned above, Pascal's triangle and Pascal's wager still bear his name.\nPascal's development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling, today it is extremely important in economics, especially in actuarial science . John Ross writes, \"Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual's and society's ability to influence the course of future events.\" [33] However, it should be noted that Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. Christiaan Huygens , learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace .\nIn literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists . The content of his literary work is best remembered for its strong opposition to the rationalism of René Descartes and simultaneous assertion that the main countervailing philosophy, empiricism , was also insufficient for determining major truths.\nIn France, prestigious annual awards, Blaise Pascal Chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region. [34] One of the Universities of Clermont-Ferrand , France – Université Blaise Pascal – is named after him. The University of Waterloo , Ontario, Canada, holds an annual math contest named in his honour. [35]\nPascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that we are, according to Wood, \"born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject God continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness\". [36]\nRoberto Rossellini directed a filmed biopic, Blaise Pascal, which originally aired on Italian television in 1971. [37] Pascal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 BBC Two documentary, Sea of Faith , presented by Don Cupitt .\nFurther reading[ edit ]\nAdamson, Donald .

                "Blaise Pascal - Metapedia\nBlaise Pascal\n[blɛz paskal]\n; 19 June 1623 – 19 August 1662), was a French mathematician , physicist , inventor , writer and Catholic philosopher . He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen .  Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the study of fluids , and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalizing the work of Evangelista Torricelli . Pascal also wrote in defense of the scientific method .\nIn 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines, and after three years of effort and 50 prototypes [1] he invented the mechanical calculator . [2] [3] He built twenty of these machines (called the Pascaline ) in the following ten years. [4] Pascal was a mathematician of the first order. He helped create two major new areas of research. He wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of sixteen, and later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory , strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science . Following Galileo and Torricelli, in 1646 he refuted Aristotle's followers who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum .  His results caused many disputes before being accepted.\nIn 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism . [5] His father died in 1651.  Following a mystical experience in late 1654, he had his \"second conversion\", abandoned his scientific work, and devoted himself to philosophy and theology . His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pensées , the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits . In this year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle.  Between 1658 and 1659 he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids.\nPascal had poor health especially after his eighteenth year and his death came just two months after his 39th birthday. [6]\nContents\n10 External links\nEarly life and education\nPascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand ; he lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three. [7] His father, Étienne Pascal (1588–1651), who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the \" Noblesse de Robe \".  Pascal had two sisters, the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte.\nIn 1631, five years after the death of his wife, [8] Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family.  Étienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise.  The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science.\nParticularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections . Following Desargues' thinking, the sixteen-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the \"Mystic Hexagram\", Essai pour les coniques (\"Essay on Conics\") and sent it—his first serious work of mathematics—to Père Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascal's theorem . It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line).\nPascal's work was so precocious that Descartes was convinced that Pascal's father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: \"I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,\" adding, \"but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a sixteen-year-old child.\" [9]\nIn France at that time offices and positions could be—and were—bought and sold. In 1631 Étienne sold his position as second president of the Cour des Aides for 65,665 livres . [10] The money was invested in a government bond which provided if not a lavish then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years' War , defaulted on the government's bonds. Suddenly Étienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.\nAn early Pascaline on display at the Musée des Arts et Métiers , Paris\nLike so many others, Étienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu , leaving his three children in the care of his neighbor Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal, and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen — a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.\nIn 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid, Pascal, not yet nineteen,  constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal's calculator or the Pascaline.  The Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris and the Zwinger museum in Dresden , Germany , exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators. Though these machines are early forerunners to computer engineering , the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Because it was extraordinarily expensive the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and status symbol , for the very rich both in France and throughout Europe. However, Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade and built twenty machines in total.\nContributions to mathematics\nPascal's triangle . Each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle demonstrates many mathematical properties in addition to showing binomial coefficients .\nPascal continued to influence mathematics throughout his life. His Traité du triangle arithmétique (\"Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle\") of 1653 described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients , now called Pascal's triangle .  The triangle can also be represented:\n0\n6\n1\nHe defines the numbers in the triangle by recursion :  Call the number in the (m+1)st row and (n+1)st column tmn.  Then tmn = tm-1,n + tm,n-1, for m = 0, 1, 2... and n = 0, 1, 2...  The boundary conditions are tm, −1 = 0, t−1, n for m = 1, 2, 3... and n = 1, 2, 3...  The generator t00 = 1.  Pascal concludes with the proof,\n<math>t_{mn} = \\frac{(m+n)(m+n-1)...(m+1)}{n(n-1)...1}.\\ </math>\nIn 1654, prompted by a friend interested in gambling problems, he corresponded with Fermat on the subject, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities . The friend was the Chevalier de Méré , and the specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly , based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point.

Vacuums—the absence of any and everything—were simply an impossibility.\nFollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide (\"New Experiments with the Vacuum\"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube.\nOn 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, Florin Périer , husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by Périer, reads:\n\"The weather was chancy last Saturday...[but] around five o'clock that morning...the Puy-de-Dôme was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work...  \"...at eight o'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured sixteen pounds of quicksilver ...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26\" and 3½ lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time...  \"I attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy-de-Dôme , about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23\" and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case...\" [13]\nPascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie , a height of about fifty meters. The mercury dropped two lines.\nIn the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascal's empty space, Pascal, in his reply to Estienne Noel , gave one of the seventeenth century's major statements on the scientific method, which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by Karl Popper that scientific theories are characterised by their falsifiability : \"In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.\" [14] His insistence on the existence of the vacuum also led to conflict with other prominent scientists, including Descartes.\nPascal introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in the 17th century in his search for a perpetual motion machine. [15]\nAdult life, religion, philosophy, and literature\nFor after all what is man in nature? A nothing in relation to infinity, all in relation to nothing, a central point between nothing and all and infinitely far from understanding either. The ends of things and their beginnings are impregnably concealed from him in an impenetrable secret. He is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness out of which he was drawn and the infinite in which he is engulfed.\nBlaise Pascal, Pensées #72\nPascal studying the cycloid , by Augustin Pajou , 1785, Louvre\nIn the winter of 1646, Pascal's 58 year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal \"would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...\" [16] But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become household guests.\nBoth men were followers of Jean Guillebert , proponent of a splinter group from the main body of Catholic teaching known as Jansenism . This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time.  It espoused rigorous Augustinism .  Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and upon his successful treatment of Étienne, borrowed works by Jansenist authors from them.  In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of \"first conversion\" and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.\nPascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his \"worldly period\" (1648–54).  His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and Jacqueline, of which Pascal acted as her conservator.  Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal .  Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he too needed her.\n\"Suddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn't work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise's fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind.\" [17]\nBy the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister.  In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother.  Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry.  In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, \"He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...\" [18] In early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline, Pascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, \"had begun to smell like a cult.\" [19] With two-thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29 year old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty.\nFor a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God. [20]\nBrush with death\n[ dubious – discuss ] On 23 November 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious vision and immediately recorded the experience in a brief note to himself which began: \"Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...\" and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: \"I will not forget thy word. Amen.\" He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. [21] This piece is now known as the Memorial. The story of the carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars. [22] His belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris.  It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the Provincial Letters.\nThe Provincial Letters",
                "Blaise Pascal - Theologian, Philosopher, Physicist, Scientist, Mathematician - Biography.com\nBlaise Pascal\nBlaise Pascal was a French mathematician, physicist and religious philosopher, who laid the foundation for the modern theory of probabilities.\nIN THESE GROUPS\nEuropean\nSynopsis\nMathematician Blaise Pascal was born on June 19, 1623, in Clermont-Ferrand, France. In the 1640s he invented the Pascaline, an early calculator, and further validated Evangelista Torricelli's theory concerning the cause of barometrical variations. In the 1650s, Pascal laid the foundation of probability theory with Pierre de Fermat and published the theological work Les Provinciales, a groundbreaking series of letters that defended his Jansenist faith. Pascal is also widely known for his body of notes posthumously released as the Pensées. He died in Paris on August 19, 1662.\nBackground and Early Life\nInventor, mathematician, physicist and theological writer Blaise Pascal, born on June 19, 1623 in Clermont-Ferrand, France, was the third of four children and only son to Etienne and Antoinette Pascal. His mother passed away when Blaise was just a toddler and he became exceptionally close to his two sisters Gilberte and Jacqueline. His father, Etienne, was a tax collector and talented mathematician.\nEtienne moved the family to Paris in 1631. He had decided to educate Blaise—a child prodigy—at home so he could design an unorthodox curriculum and make sure that Blaise was able to express his own innate curiosity. It's also believed that Blaise may have been educated at home due to issues around his health. Ironically, Etienne omitted mathematics from his son's early curriculum out of concern that Blaise would become so fascinated with geometry that he wouldn’t be able to focus on classical subjects.\nThe beginning of Blaise’s education was geared toward languages, especially Latin and Greek. Even so, Etienne's plan backfired: The fact that mathematics was a forbidden topic made the subject even more interesting to the inquisitive boy, who at the age of 12 began exploring geometry on his own. He made up his own terminology, not having learned official mathematical terms, and quickly managed to work out that the sum of a triangle's angles are equal to two right angles.\nMystic Hexagram and Religious Conversion\nEtienne was impressed. In answer to Blaise's unswerving fascination, his father permitted him to read the works of ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. Etienne also allowed Blaise to accompany him to meetings at Mersenne's Academy in Paris. It was there, at age 16, that Blaise presented a number of his early theorems, including his Mystic Hexagram, to some of the premier mathematical thinkers of the time.\nAfter a bit of political tumult, the Pascal family drew up stakes once again in 1640. They moved to Rouen, France, where Blaise's father had been appointed the previous year to collect taxes. In 1640, Pascal also published his first written work, Essay on Conic Sections. The writings constituted an important leap forward in projective geometry, which involved transferring a 3-D object onto a 2-D field.\nIn 1646, Etienne was seriously injured in a fall that resulted in a broken hip, rendering him housebound. The accident created a shift in the family's religious beliefs, as the Pascals had never fully embraced local Jesuit ideas. After Etienne's accident, he received medical visits from two brothers who were also followers of Jansenism, a particular denomination within the Catholic Church. Their influence, presumably coupled with trauma over Etienne's health, led the family to convert. Blaise became devoutly religious and sister Jacqueline eventually becoming a Jansenist nun. \nInventions and Discoveries\nIn 1642, inspired by the idea of making his father's job of  calculating taxes easier, Blaise Pascal started work on a calculator dubbed  the Pascaline. (German polymath William Schickard had developed and  manufactured an earlier version of the calculator in 1623.) The  Pascaline was a numerical wheel calculator with movable dials,  each representing a numerical digit. The invention, however, was not without its glitches: There was a discrepancy between  the calculator's design and the structure of French currency at the  time. Pascal continued to  work on improving the device, with 50 prototypes produced by 1652, but the Pascaline was never a big seller.\nIn 1648, Pascal  starting writing more of his theorems in The  Generation of Conic Sections, but he pushed the work aside until the following decade.\nAt the end of the 1640s, Pascal temporarily focused his experiments on  the physical sciences. Following in Evangelista Torricelli’s footsteps,  Pascal experimented with how atmospheric pressure could be estimated in  terms of weight. In 1648, by having his brother-in-law take readings of the barometric pressure at  various altitudes on a mountain (Pascal was too poor of health to make the trek himself), he validated Torricelli's theory concerning the  cause of barometrical variations.\nIn the 1650s, Pascal set about trying to create a perpetual motion  machine, the purpose of which was to produce more energy than it used.  In the process, he stumbled upon an accidental invention and in 1655 Pascal's roulette machine was born. Aptly, he derived its name from the  French word for \"little wheel.\"\nOverlapping his work on the roulette machine was Pascal's correspondence  with mathematical theorist Pierre de Fermat, which began in 1654. Through  their letters discussing gambling and Pascal's own  experiments, he found that there is a fixed likelihood of a particular outcome when it comes to the roll of the dice. This discovery  was the basis of the mathematical theory of probability, with Pascal's writings on the subject published posthumously.\nAlthough the specific dates are uncertain, Pascal also reportedly  invented a primitive form of the wristwatch. It was an informal  invention to say the least: The mathematician was known to strap his  pocket watch to his wrist with a piece of string, presumably for the  sake of convenience while tinkering with other inventions.\nNoted Literary Works\nAntoine Arnauld was a Sorbonne theologian who defended Jansenist beliefs, and thus found his position under fire from papal doctrine and university faculty. Pascal wrote a series of pseudonymous open letters from 1656-57 that ultimately came to be known as Les Provinciales. The writings defended Arnauld and critiqued Jesuit beliefs while exhibiting a groundbreaking style, relying on relatively tight, sharp prose with irony and satire.\nStarting in 1657, Pascal had also begun to write notes that would be posthumously organized and published as the Pensées, going into great detail about the contours of the thinker's position on his faith. The Pensées is an extensive work with assertions that might be considered controversial to some in contemporary times. The most oft cited portion of the collection is Pascal's famed \"Wager,\" in which he states that it is more advantageous for religious skeptics to embrace a belief in God as they ultimately have more to lose if a higher power is revealed after death. \nDeath and Legacy\nPascal, a complex personality, was described by biographer Donald Adamson as \"precocious, stubbornly persevering, a perfectionist, pugnacious to the point of bullying ruthlessness yet seeking to be meek and humble.\" Pascal had struggled with insomnia and a digestive disorder from the time he was a teen, and as such he  was known to have suffered greatly from pain throughout his life. Over the years, Pascal’s constant work took a further toll on his already fragile health. \nPascal died of a malignant stomach tumor at his sister Gilberte's home  in Paris on August 19, 1662. By then, the tumor had metastasized in his  brain. He was 39 years old. \nPascal's inventions and discoveries have been instrumental to  developments in the fields of geometry, physics and computer science, influencing 17th-century visionaries like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and  Isaac Newton . During the 20th century, the Pascal (Pa) unit was named after the thinker in  honor of his contributions to the understanding of atmospheric pressure  and how it could be estimated in terms of weight. In the late 1960s, Swiss computer scientist Nicklaus Wirth invented a computer language  and insisted on naming it after Pascal. This was Wirth's way of  memorializing Pascal's invention of the Pascaline, one of the earliest  forms of the modern computer. \nFact Check\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

                "Blaise Pascal\nBlaise Pascal\nSet cemetery\nPerson\nBlaise Pascal (French: [blɛz paskal]; 19 June 1623 – 19 August 1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer and Christian philosopher. He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen. Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalizing the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Pascal also wrote in defense of the scientific method.\nIn 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines. After three years of effort and fifty prototypes, he invented the mechanical calculator. He built 20 of these machines (called Pascal's calculators and later Pascalines) in the following ten years. Pascal was an important mathematician, helping create two major new areas of research: he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16, and later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. Following Galileo and Torricelli, in 1646 he refuted Aristotle's followers who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum. Pascal's results caused many disputes before being accepted.\nIn 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism. His father died in 1651. Following a mystical experience in late 1654, he had his \"second conversion\", abandoned his scientific work, and devoted himself to philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pensées, the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. In this year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659 he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids.\nPascal had poor health especially after his 18th year and his death came just two months after his 39th birthday.\nEarly life and education\nPascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand; he lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three. His father, Étienne Pascal (1588–1651), who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the \"Noblesse de Robe\". Pascal had two sisters, the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte.\nIn 1631, five years after the death of his wife, Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family. Étienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise. The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science.\nParticularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues' thinking, the 16-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the \"Mystic Hexagram\", Essai pour les coniques (\"Essay on Conics\") and sent it—his first serious work of mathematics—to Père Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascal's theorem. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line).\nPascal's work was so precocious that Descartes was convinced that Pascal's father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: \"I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,\" adding, \"but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child.\"\nIn France at that time offices and positions could be—and were—bought and sold. In 1631 Étienne sold his position as second president of the Cour des Aides for 65,665 livres. The money was invested in a government bond which provided if not a lavish then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years' War, defaulted on the government's bonds. Suddenly Étienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.\n \nAn early Pascaline on display at the Musée des Arts et Métiers, Paris\n \nLike so many others, Étienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbor Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal, and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen — a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.\nIn 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid, Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal's calculator or the Pascaline. The Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris and the Zwinger museum in Dresden, Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators. Though these machines are early forerunners to computer engineering, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Because it was extraordinarily expensive the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and status symbol, for the very rich both in France and throughout Europe. However, Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade and built 20 machines in total.\nContributions to mathematics\n \nPascal's triangle. Each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle demonstrates many mathematical properties in addition to showing binomial coefficients.\n \nPascal continued to influence mathematics throughout his life. His Traité du triangle arithmétique (\"Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle\") of 1653 described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients, now called Pascal's triangle. The triangle can also be represented:\n \n     0    1    2    3    4    5    6 0 1    1    1    1    1    1    1 1 1    2    3    4    5    6      2 1    3    6    10    15           3 1    4    10    20                4 1    5    15                     5 1    6                          6 1                              \n \nHe defines the numbers in the triangle by recursion: Call the number in the (m + 1)th row and (n + 1)th column tmn. Then tmn = tm–1,n + tm,n–1, for m = 0, 1, 2, ... and n = 0, 1, 2, ... The boundary conditions are tm,−1 = 0, t−1,n = 0 for m = 1, 2, 3, ... and n = 1, 2, 3, ... The generator t00 = 1. Pascal concludes with the proof,\n \n \nIn 1654, prompted by a friend interested in gambling problems, he corresponded with Fermat on the subject, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities. The friend was the Chevalier de Méré, and the specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly, based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later (in the Pensées) used a probabilistic argument, Pascal's Wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz' formulation of the infinitesimal calculus.\nAfter a religious experience in 1654, Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics.\nPhilosophy of mathematics\nPascal's major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his De l'Esprit géométrique (\"Of the Geometrical Spirit\"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous \"Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal\" (\"Little Schools of Port-Royal\"). The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.\nPascal also used De l'Esprit géométrique to develop a theory of definition. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes.\nIn De l'Art de persuader (\"On the Art of Persuasion\"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.\nContributions to the physical sciences\n \nAn illustration of the (apocryphal) Pascal's barrel experiment\n \nPascal's work in the fields of the study of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal's barrel experiment. By 1646, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli's experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a vacuum, some invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and that this substance was forever in motion. Furthermore, \"Everything that is in motion must be moved by something,\" Aristotle declared. Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal's time, a vacuum was an impossibility. How so? As proof it was pointed out:\nLight passed through the so-called \"vacuum\" in the glass tube.\nAristotle wrote how everything moved, and must be moved by something.\nTherefore, since there had to be an invisible \"something\" to move the light through the glass tube, there was no vacuum in the tube. Not in the glass tube or anywhere else. Vacuums – the absence of any and everything – were simply an impossibility.\nFollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide (\"New Experiments with the Vacuum\"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube.\nOn 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, Florin Périer, husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by Périer, reads:\n\"The weather was chancy last Saturday...[but] around five o'clock that morning...the Puy-de-Dôme was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work... \"...at eight o'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured 16 pounds of quicksilver...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26\" and 3½ lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time... \"I attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy-de-Dôme, about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23\" and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case...\"\nPascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, a height of about fifty meters. The mercury dropped two lines.\nIn the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascal's empty space, Pascal, in his reply to Estienne Noel, gave one of the 17th century's major statements on the scientific method, which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by Karl Popper that scientific theories are characterised by their falsifiability: \"In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.\" His insistence on the existence of the vacuum also led to conflict with other prominent scientists, including Descartes.\nPascal introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in the 17th century in his search for a perpetual motion machine.\nAdult life, religion, philosophy, and literature\nFor after all what is man in nature? A nothing in relation to infinity, all in relation to nothing, a central point between nothing and all and infinitely far from understanding either. The ends of things and their beginnings are impregnably concealed from him in an impenetrable secret. He is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness out of which he was drawn and the infinite in which he is engulfed.\nBlaise Pascal, Pensées #72                                              Religious conversion\n \nPascal studying the cycloid, by Augustin Pajou, 1785, Louvre\n \nIn the winter of 1646, Pascal's 58 year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal \"would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...\" But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become household guests.\nBoth men were followers of Jean Guillebert, proponent of a splinter group from the main body of Catholic teaching known as Jansenism. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous Augustinism. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and upon his successful treatment of Étienne, borrowed works by Jansenist authors from them. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of \"first conversion\" and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.\nPascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his \"worldly period\" (1648–54). His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and Jacqueline, of which Pascal acted as her conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he too needed her.\n\"Suddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn't work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise's fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind.\"\nBy the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother. Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, \"He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...\" In early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline, Pascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, \"had begun to smell like a cult.\" With two-thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29 year old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty.\nFor a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.\nBrush with death\nOn 23 November 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious vision and immediately recorded the experience in a brief note to himself which began: \"Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...\" and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: \"I will not forget thy word. Amen.\" He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. This piece is now known as the Memorial. The story of the carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars. His belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the Provincial Letters.\nThe Provincial Letters\nBeginning in 1656, Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry, a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period (especially the Jesuits, and in particular Antonio Escobar). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the formulary controversy, the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied Alexander VII himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments.\nAside from their religious influence, the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\nWide praise has been given to the Provincial Letters.\nThe Pensées\nPascal's most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the Pensées (\"Thoughts\"), was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title Apologie de la religion Chrétienne (\"Defense of the Christian Religion\"). The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets (\"Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects\") and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the Apologie's main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of skepticism and stoicism, personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.\nPascal's Pensées is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose. When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language. Will Durant hailed it as \"the most eloquent book in French prose.\" In Pensées, Pascal surveys several philosophical paradoxes: infinity and nothing, faith and reason, soul and matter, death and life, meaning and vanity—seemingly arriving at no definitive conclusions besides humility, ignorance, and grace. Rolling these into one he develops Pascal's Wager.\nLast works and death",

In this lesson, you will learn that he laid the foundation for probability. To help his father, Blaise even designed a calculator to make tax calculations easier.\nBlaise Pascal's Contributions\nBlaise Pascal lived in 17th century France and made several contributions to the fields of mathematics, physics, and philosophy. He is known for laying the foundation for today's probability theory, for his work in barometric pressure, and for his theological writings.\nBlaise Pascal made contributions to mathematics, physics, and philosophy. In mathematics, you might recognize his name in Pascal's triangle. The numbers that form Pascal's triangle are binomial coefficients. Each number is the sum of the two numbers above it. The tip of the triangle and the sides are all ones. The numbers forming the body of the triangle are the addition of the two immediately above. For example, the middle number in the third row is the addition of the two numbers from the second row. Pascal presented this information in written form in 1653.\nA year later, Pascal laid the foundation for probability theory. He was inspired by his desire to help a friend who had some questions about gambling. He realized that events don't happen randomly, but actually depend on what happened just before the event. In other words, if you had a box of blue and red balls, and you had already taken a blue ball out, the probability of taking a red ball out now will have changed.\nIn 1646, Blaise Pascal experimented with atmospheric pressure and discovered that vacuums exist in the real world. He also found that atmospheric pressure can be measured using real weights. After a conversion experience, Blaise Pascal fully converted to Jansenism and wrote the Provincial Letters in which he defended Jansenism and its leading philosopher against the Jesuits.\nPascal's Inventions\nIn the year 1642, at just 18 years old, Pascal invented a calculator to help out his father. This calculator was called the Pascaline and had a wheel with eight movable parts for dialing. Each part corresponded to a particular digit in a number. For example, the number 368 would be dialed in three parts with a three, six, and eight, respectively for the hundreds, tens, and ones position. The Pascaline could add, subtract, multiply, and even divide. This was an early form of the now standard digital calculator.\nAlso in the 1640s, while tinkering with barometric pressure, Blaise Pascal invented the syringe and the hydraulic press. Today, we see syringes in health facilities everywhere, and hydraulic presses are used in auto shops to lift up cars and in many other applications. Another invention of Pascal's was the roulette machine in 1655. This invention was actually an accident that resulted when Pascal tried to invent a perpetual motion machine that would produce energy.\nInteresting Facts\nBlaise Pascal only lived for 39 years, but they were 39 years full of discoveries, learning, and creativity. Born on June 19, 1623 in France, Blaise Pascal lost his mother only three years after in 1626. He died himself on August 19, 1662 in Paris.\n×",

                "Pantomime (informally panto) is a type of musical comedy stage production, designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed there, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or folk tale.Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline. \"Pantomime\", The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature, Jack Zipes (ed.), Oxford University Press (2006), ISBN 9780195146561. It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.\n\nPantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre, and it developed partly from the 16th century commedia dell'arte tradition of Italy, as well as other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century masques and music hall. An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the harlequinade.\n\nOutside Britain the word \"pantomime\" is usually used to mean miming, rather than the theatrical form discussed here. \n\nRoman pantomime\n\nThe word pantomime was adopted from  the Latin word pantomimus,  which in turn derives from the Greek word παντόμιμος (pantomimos), consisting of παντο- (panto-) meaning \"all\", and μῖμος (mimos), meaning a dancer who acted all the roles or all the story .Hall, Edith and Rosie Wyles (eds). New Directions in Ancient Pantomime, Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 3[http://www.britannica.com/art/pantomimus  Pantomimus], Encyclopaedia Brittanica  The Roman pantomime drew upon the Greek tragedy and other Greek genres from its inception, although the art was instituted in Rome and little is known of it in pre-Roman Greece.  The English word came to be applied to the performance itself. According to a lost oration by Aelius Aristides, the pantomime was known for its erotic content and the effeminacy of its dancing;  Aristides's work was responded to by Libanius, in his oration \"On Behalf of the Dancers\", written probably around 361 AD.\n\nRoman pantomime was a production, usually based upon myth or legend, for a solo male dancer—clad in a long silk tunic and a short mantle (pallium) that was often used as a \"prop\"—accompanied by a sung libretto (called the fabula saltica or \"dance-story\") rendered by a singer or chorus (though Lucian states that originally the pantomime himself was the singer).  Music was supplied by flute and the pulse of an iron-shod shoe (scabellum). Performances might be in a private household, with minimal personnel, or else lavish theatrical productions involving a large orchestra and chorus and sometimes an ancillary actor. The dancer danced all the roles, relying on masks, stock poses and gestures and a hand-language (cheironomy) so complex and expressive that the pantomime's hands were commonly compared to an eloquent mouth.Alessandra Zanobi. [http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/learning/short-guides/ancient-pantomime-and-its-reception Ancient Pantomime and its Reception], Oxford University Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama Pantomime differed from mime by its more artistic nature and relative lack of farce and coarse humour, though these were not absent from some productions.\n\nRoman pantomime was immensely popular from the end of the first century BC until the end of the sixth century AD, a form of entertainment that spread throughout the empire where, due to its wordless nature, it did more than any other art to foster knowledge of the myths and Roman legends that formed its subject-matter – tales such as those of the love of Venus and Mars and of Dido and Aeneas – while in Italy its chief exponents were celebrities, often the protegés of influential citizens, whose followers wore badges proclaiming their allegiance and engaged in street-fights with rival groups, while its accompanying songs became widely-known. Yet, due to the limits imposed upon Roman citizens' dance, the populism of its song-texts and other factors, the art was as much despised as adored and its practitioners were usually slaves or freedmen.\n\nBecause of the low status and the disappearance of its libretti, the Roman pantomime received little modern scholarly attention until the late 20th century, despite its great influence upon Roman culture as perceived in Roman art, in statues of famous dancers, graffiti, objects and literature. After the renaissance of classical culture, Roman pantomime was a decisive influence upon modern European concert dance, helping to transform ballet from a mere entertainment, a display of technical virtuosity, into the dramatic ballet d'action, an antecedent which, through writers and ballet-masters of the 17th and 18th century such as  Claude-François Ménestrier (1631–1705), John Weaver (1673–1760), Jean-Georges Noverre (1727–1810) and Gasparo Angiolini (1731-1803), lent respectability and attested to the capability of dance to render complex stories and express human emotion.\n\nDevelopment of pantomime in England\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Mummers Play was a traditional English folk play, based loosely on the Saint George and the Dragon legend, usually performed during Christmas gatherings, which contained the origin of many of the archetypal elements of the pantomime, such as stage fights, coarse humour and fantastic creatures,  gender role reversal, and good defeating evil.  Precursors of pantomime also included the masque, which grew in pomp and spectacle from the 15th to the 17th centuries. \n\nThe development of English pantomime was also strongly influenced by the continental commedia dell'arte, a form of popular theatre that arose in Italy in the Early Modern Period.  This was a \"comedy of professional artists\" travelling from province to province in Italy and then France, who improvised and told comic stories that held lessons for the crowd, changing the main character depending on where they were performing. Each scenario used some of the same stock characters. These included the innamorati (young lovers); the vecchi (old men) such as Pantalone; and zanni (servants) such as Arlecchino, Colombina, Scaramouche and Pierrot.Mayer, David. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subviewMain&entry\nt177.e2999 \"Pantomime, British\",] Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance, Oxford University Press, 2003, accessed 21 October 2011   Italian masque performances in the 17th century sometimes included the Harlequin character. \nIn the 17th century, adaptations of the commedia characters became familiar in English entertainments.[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/early-pantomime/ \"Early pantomime\"], Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 21 October 2011 From these, the standard English harlequinade developed, depicting the eloping lovers Harlequin and Columbine, pursued by the girl's father Pantaloon and his comic servants Clown and Pierrot. In English versions, by the 18th century, Harlequin became the central figure and romantic lead.Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found (eds). [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview\nMain&entryt79.e1417 \"Harlequinade\",] The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre, Oxford Reference Online, Oxford University Press, 1996, accessed 21 October 2011.  The basic plot of the harlequinade remained essentially the same for more than 150 years, except that a bumbling policeman was added to the chase.\n\nIn the first two decades of the 18th century, two rival London theatres, Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane (the patent theatres) presented productions that began seriously with classical stories that contained elements of opera and ballet and ended with a comic \"night scene\". Tavern Bilkers, by John Weaver, the dancing master at Drury Lane, is cited as the first pantomime produced on the English stage.  This production was not a success, and Weaver waited until 1716 to produce his next pantomimes, including The Loves of Mars and Venus – a new Entertainment in Dancing after the manner of the Antient Pantomimes. The same year he produced a pantomime on the subject of Perseus and Andromeda. After this, pantomime was regular feature at Drury Lane.  In 1717 at Lincoln's Inn, actor and manager John Rich introduced Harlequin into the theatres' pantomimes under the name of \"Lun\" (for \"lunatic\").Dircks, Phyllis T. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/23486 \"Rich, John (1692–1761)\"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2011, accessed 21 October 2011.  He gained great popularity for his pantomimes, especially beginning with his 1724 production of The Necromancer; or, History of Dr. Faustus. \n\nThese early pantomimes were silent, or \"dumb show\", performances consisting of only dancing and gestures. Spoken drama was only allowed in London only in the two (later three) patent theatres until Parliament changed this restriction in 1843. A large number of French performers played in London following the suppression of unlicensed theatres in Paris. Although this constraint was only temporary, English pantomimes remained primarily visual for some decades before dialogue was introduced. An 18th-century author wrote of David Garrick: \"He formed a kind of harlequinade, very different from that which is seen at the Opéra-Comique in Paris, where harlequin and all the characters speak.\"  The majority of these early pantomimes were re-tellings of a story from ancient Greek or Roman literature, with a break between the two acts during which the harlequinade's zany comic business, was performed. The theatre historian David Mayer explains the use of the \"batte\" or slapstick and the transformation scene that led to the harlequinade:\n\nPantomime gradually became more topical and comic, often involving spectacular and elaborate theatrical effects as far as possible. Colley Cibber, David Garrick and others competed with Rich and produced their own pantomimes, and pantomime continued to grow in popularity. \n\n19th century\n\nBy the early 1800s, the pantomime's classical stories were often supplanted by stories adapted from European fairy tales, fables, folk tales, classic English literature or nursery rhymes. Also, the harlequinade grew in importance until it often was the longest and most important part of the entertainment. Pantomimes usually had dual titles that gave an often humorous idea of both the pantomime story and the harlequinade. \"Harlequin and ________\", or \"Harlequin _______; or, the ________\".  In the second case, harlequin was used as an adjective, followed by words that described the pantomime \"opening\", for example: Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren; or, Fortunatus and the Water of Life, the Three Bears, the Three Gifts, the Three Wishes, and the Little Man who Woo'd the Little Maid. Harlequin was the first word (or the first word after the \"or\") because Harlequin was initially the most important character. The titles continued to include the word Harlequin even after the first decade of the 1800s, when Joseph Grimaldi came to dominate London pantomime and made the character Clown a colourful agent of chaos, as important in the entertainment as Harlequin. At the same time, Harlequin began to be portrayed in a more romantic and stylised way. \n\nGrimaldi's performances elevated the role by \"acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society, and his happy talent of holding them up to ridicule. He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that the most saturnine looker-on acknowledged his sway; and neither the wise, the proud, or the fair, the young nor the old, were ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities.\"Broadbent, chapter 16. Grimaldi's performances were important in expanding the importance of the harlequinade until it dominated the pantomime entertainment.Moody, Jane. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/11630 \"Grimaldi, Joseph (1778–1837)\"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 21 October 2011.\n\nBy the 1800s, therefore, children went to the theatre around the Christmas and New Year holiday (and often at Easter or other times) primarily to witness the craziness of the harlequinade chase scene. It was the most exciting part of the \"panto\", because it was fast paced and included spectacular scenic magic as well as slapstick comedy, dancing and acrobatics. The presence of slapstick in this part of the show evolved from the characters found in Italian commedia dell'arte.  The plot of the Harlequinade was relatively simple; the star-crossed lovers, Harlequin and Columbine, run away from Columbine's foolish father, Pantaloon, who is being slowed down in his pursuit of them by his servant, Clown, and by a bumbling policeman. After the time of Grimaldi, Clown became the principal schemer trying to thwart the lovers, and Pantaloon was merely his assistant.\n\nThe opening \"fairy story\" was often blended with a story about a love triangle: a \"cross-grained\" old father who owns a business has a pretty daughter, who is pursued by two suitors. The one she loves is poor but worthy, while the father prefers the other, a wealthy fop. Another character is a servant in the father's establishment. Just as the daughter is to be forcibly wed to the fop, or just as she was about to elope with her lover, the good fairy arrives. This was followed by what was often the most spectacular part of the production, the magical transformation scene. In early pantomimes, Harlequin possessed magical powers that he used to help himself and his love interest escape. He would tap his wooden sword (a derivative of the Commedia dell'arte slapstick or \"batte\") on the floor or scenery to make a grand transition of the world around him take place. The scene would switch from being inside some house or castle to, generally speaking, the streets of the town with storefronts as the backdrop. The transformation sequence was presided over by a Fairy Queen or Fairy Godmother character. The good fairy magically transformed the leads from the opening fairy story into their new identities as the harlequinade characters. Following is an example of the speech that the fairy would give during this transformation:\n\nLovers stand forth. With you we shall begin.\nYou will be fair Columbine - you Harlequin.\nKing Jamie there, the bonnie Scottish loon,\nWill be a famous cheild for Pantaloon.\nThough Guy Fawkes now is saved from rocks and axe,\nI think he should pay the powder-tax.\nHis guyish plots blown up - nay, do not frown;\nYou've always been a guy - now be a Clown.\n\nThis passage is from a pantomime adaptation of the Guy Fawkes story. The fairy creates the characters of the harlequinade in the most typical fashion of simply telling the characters what they will change into. The principal male and female characters from the beginning plotline, often both played by young women, became the lovers Columbine and Harlequin, the mother or father of Columbine became Pantaloon, and the servant or other comic character became Clown. They would transition into the new characters as the scenery around them changed and would proceed in the \"zany fun\" section of the performance.  From the time of Grimaldi, Clown would see the transformed setting and cry: \"Here We Are Again!\" The harlequinade began with various chase scenes, in which Harlequin and Columbine manage to escape from the clutches of Clown and Pantaloon, despite the acrobatic leaps of the former through windows, atop ladders, often because of well-meaning but misguided actions of the policeman. Eventually, there was a \"dark scene\", such as a cave or forest, in which the lovers were caught, and Harlequin's magic wand was seized from his grasp by Clown, who would flourish it in triumph. The good fairy would then reappear, and once the father agreed to the marriage of the young lovers, she would transport the whole company to a grand final scene.\n\nAfter 1843, when theatres other than the original patent theatres were permitted to perform spoken dialogue, the importance of the silent harlequinade began to decrease, while the importance of the fairy-tale part of the pantomime increased.[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/pantomime-origins/ \"The Origin of Popular Pantomime Stories\"], Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed January 8, 2016 Two writers who helped to elevate the importance and popularity of the fairy-tale portion of the pantomome were James Planché and Henry James Byron. They emphasized puns and humorous word play, a tradition that continues in pantomime today. As manager of Drury Lane in the 1870s, Augustus Harris wrote a series of extraordinarily popular pantomimes that formed a part of this transition by emphasizing comic business in the pantomime opening. By the end of the 19th century, the harlequinade had become merely a brief epilogue to the pantomime, dwindling into a brief display of dancing and acrobatics. It lingered for a few decades longer but finally disappeared, although a few of its comic elements had been incorporated into the pantomime stories. The last harlequinade was played at the Lyceum Theatre in 1939. \n\nModern pantomime traditions and conventions\n\nTraditionally performed at Christmas, with family audiences, British pantomime continues as a popular form of theatre, incorporating song, dance, buffoonery, slapstick, cross-dressing, in-jokes, topical references, audience participation, and mild sexual innuendo. \n\nTraditional stories\n\nPantomime story lines and scripts usually make no direct reference to Christmas, and are almost always based on traditional children's stories, particularly the fairy tales of Charles Perrault, Joseph Jacobs, Hans Christian Andersen and the Grimm Brothers. Some of the most popular pantomime stories include Cinderella, Aladdin, Dick Whittington and His Cat and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,[http://www.its-behind-you.com/Factsheets/The%20History%20of%20Pantomime.pdf \"The History of Pantomime\"], It's-Behind-You.com, 2002, accessed 10 February 2013. as well as Jack and the Beanstalk, Peter Pan, Puss in Boots and Sleeping Beauty.  Other traditional stories include Mother Goose, Beauty and the Beast, Robinson Crusoe, The Wizard of Oz, Babes in the Wood (combined with elements of Robin Hood), Little Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Sinbad, St. George and the Dragon, Bluebeard, The Little Mermaid and Thumbelina. Prior to about 1870, many other stories were made into pantomimes. \n\nWhile the familiarity of the audience with the original children's story is generally assumed, plot lines are almost always adapted for comic or satirical effect, and characters and situations from other stories are often interpolated into the plot. For instance \"panto\" versions of Aladdin may include elements from Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves or other Arabian Nights tales; while Jack and the Beanstalk might include references to nursery rhymes and other children's stories involving characters called \"Jack\", such as Jack and Jill. Certain familiar scenes tend to recur, regardless of plot relevance, and highly unlikely resolution of the plot is common. Straight retellings of the original stories are rare.\n\nPerformance conventions\n\nThe form has a number of conventions, some of which have changed or weakened a little over the years, and by no means all of which are obligatory. Some of these conventions were once common to other genres of popular theatre such as melodrama.\n*The leading male juvenile character (the principal boy) is traditionally played by a young woman, usually in tight-fitting male garments (such as breeches) that make her female charms evident. Her romantic partner is the principal girl, a female ingenue.\n*An older woman (the pantomime dame - often the hero's mother) is usually played by a man in drag.\n*Risqué double entendre, often wringing innuendo out of perfectly innocent phrases. This is, in theory, over the heads of the children in the audience and is for the entertainment of the adults.\n*Audience participation, including calls of \"He's behind you!\" (or \"Look behind you!\"), and \"Oh, yes it is!\" and \"Oh, no it isn't!\" The audience is always encouraged to hiss the villain and \"awwwww\" the poor victims, such as the rejected dame, who is usually enamoured with the prince.  \n*Music may be original but is more likely to combine well-known tunes with re-written lyrics. At least one \"audience participation\" song is traditional: one half of the audience may be challenged to sing \"their\" chorus louder than the other half. Children in the audience may even be invited on stage to sing along with members of the cast.\n*The animal, played by an actor in \"animal skin\" or animal costume. It is often a pantomime horse or cow, played by two actors in a single costume, one as the head and front legs, the other as the body and back legs.\n*The good fairy enters from stage right (from the audience's point of view this is on the left) and the villain enters from stage left (right from the point of view of the audience). This convention goes back to the medieval mystery plays, where the right side of the stage symbolised Heaven and the left side symbolised Hell.\n*A slapstick comedy routine may be performed, often a decorating or baking scene, with humour based on throwing messy substances. Until the 20th century, British pantomimes often concluded with a harlequinade, a free-standing entertainment of slapstick. Nowadays the slapstick is more or less incorporated into the main body of the show.\n*In the 19th century, until the 1880s, pantomimes typically included a transformation scene in which a Fairy Queen magically transformed the pantomime characters into the characters of the harlequinade, who then performed the harlequinade.\n* The Chorus, who can be considered extras on-stage, and often appear in multiple scenes (but as different characters) and who perform a variety of songs and dances throughout the show. Due to their multiple roles they may have as much stage-time as the lead characters themselves.\n*At some point during the performance, characters including the Dame and the comic will sit on a bench and sing a cheerful song to forget their fears. The thing they fear appears behind them, but at first the characters ignore the audience's warnings of danger. The characters soon circle the bench, followed by the ghost, as the audience cries \"It's behind you!\"  One by one, the characters see the ghost and run off, until at last the Dame and the ghost come face to face, whereupon the ghost, frightened by the visage of the Dame, runs away. \n\nGuest celebrity\n\nAnother contemporary pantomime tradition is the celebrity guest star, a practice that dates back to the late 19th century, when Augustus Harris, proprietor of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, hired well-known variety artists for his pantomimes.\n\nMany modern pantomimes use popular artists to promote the pantomime, and the play is often adapted to allow the star to showcase their well-known act, even when such a spot has little relation to the plot. As critic Michael Billington has explained, if the star enters into the spirit of the entertainment, he or she can add to its overall effect, while if it becomes a \"showcase for a star\" who \"stands outside the action\", the celebrity's presence can detract, notwithstanding the marketing advantage that the star brings to the piece.Billington, Michael. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2004/dec/20/theatre.shopping1 \"Aladdin: Old Vic, London\"], The Guardian, 20 December 2004.  Billington said that Ian McKellen in a 2004 Aladdin \"lets down his hair and lifts up his skirt to reveal a nifty pair of legs and an appetite for double entendre: when told by decorators that 'your front porch could do with a good lick', McKellen adopts a suitable look of mock-outrage. ... At least we can tell our grandchildren that we saw McKellen's Twankey and it was huge.\"\n\nPantomime roles\n\nMajor roles\n\nThe main roles within pantomime are usually as follows: \n\nMinor roles\n\nPlaces performed\n\nModern pantomime is performed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Bermuda, Australasia, Canada, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, South Africa, India, Gibraltar, and Malta, mostly during the Christmas and New Year season. \n\nUnited Kingdom and Republic of Ireland\n\nMany theatres in cities and towns throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland continue to have an annual professional pantomime. Pantomime is also very popular with amateur dramatics societies throughout the UK and Ireland, and the pantomime season (roughly speaking, December to February) will see pantomime productions in many village halls and similar venues across the country.\n\nAustralia\n\nPantomimes in Australia at Christmas were once very popular, but the genre has declined greatly since the middle of the 20th century.\n\nCanada\n\nChristmas pantomimes are performed yearly at the Hudson Village Theatre in Quebec.  Since 1996, Ross Petty Productions has staged pantomimes at Toronto's Elgin Theatre each Christmas season.  Pantomimes imported from England were produced at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in the 1980s.    The White Rock Players Club in White Rock, BC have presented an annual pantomime in the Christmas season since 1954.  The Royal Canadian Theatre Company produces pantomimes in British Columbia, written by Ellie King. \n\nIn Jamaica\n\nThe National Pantomime of Jamaica was started in 1941 by educators Henry Fowler and Greta Fowler, pioneers of the Little Theatre Movement in Jamaica. Among the first players was Louise Bennett-Coverley. Other notable players have included Oliver Samuels, Charles Hyatt, Willard White, Rita Marley and Dawn Penn. The annual pantomime opens on Boxing Day at the Little Theatre in Kingston and is strongly influenced by aspects of Jamaican culture, folklore and history.  \n\nUnited States\n\nPantomime has seldom been performed in the United States, although a few productions have been mounted in recent years. As a consequence, Americans commonly understand the word \"pantomime\" to refer to the art of mime as it was practised, for example, by Marcel Marceau and Nola Rae. However, certain shows that came from the pantomime traditions, especially Peter Pan, are performed quite often, and a few American theatre companies produce traditional British-style pantomime as well as American adaptations of the form.\n\nAccording to Professor Russell A. Peck of the University of Rochester,  the earliest pantomime productions in the US were Cinderella pantomime productions in New York in March 1808, New York again in August 1808, Philadelphia in 1824, and Baltimore in 1839.  A production at Olympic Theatre in New York of Humpty Dumpty ran for over 1,200 performances in 1868, becoming one of the most successful American pantomimes.\n\nIn 1993 there was a production of Cinderella at the UCLA Freud Theatre, starring Zsa Zsa Gabor.   Stages Repertory Theatre in Houston, Texas, has been performing original pantomime-style musicals during the Christmas holidays since 2008.  Lythgoe Family Productions has produced pantomimes each winter since 2010 in California."

                "What Do Christians Celebrate on Maundy Thursday?\nWhat Do Christians Celebrate on Maundy Thursday?\nFoot-washing ceremonies are often a part of Maundy Thursday services.  Chris Hondros / Getty Images\nBy Mary Fairchild\nUpdated May 02, 2016.\nMaundy Thursday is observed during Holy Week on the Thursday before Easter . Also referred to as \" Holy Thursday \" or \"Great Thursday\" in some Christian denominations , Maundy Thursday commemorates the Last Supper when Jesus shared the Passover meal with his disciples on the night before he was crucified. In contrast to joyful Easter celebrations when Christians worship their resurrected Savior, Maundy Thursday services are typically more solemn occasions, marked by the shadow of Jesus' betrayal.\nWhile different denominations observe Maundy Thursday in their own distinct ways, two important biblical events are the primary focus of Maundy Thursday solemnizations:\nBefore the Passover meal , Jesus washed the feet of his disciples. By performing this lowly act of service, the Bible says in John 13:1 that Jesus \"showed them the full extent of his love.\" By his example, Jesus demonstrated how Christians are to love one another through humble service.\nFor this reason, many churches practice foot-washing ceremonies as a part of their Maundy Thursday services.\nDuring the Passover meal, Jesus took bread and wine and asked his Father to bless it. He broke the bread into pieces, giving it to his disciples and said, \"This is my body, given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\" Then he took the cup of wine, shared it with his disciples and said, \"This wine is the token of God's new covenant to save you--an agreement sealed with the blood I will pour out for you.\" These events recorded in Luke 22:19-20 describe the Last Supper and form the biblical basis for the practice of Communion . For this reason, many churches hold special Communion services as a part of their Maundy Thursday celebrations. Likewise, many congregations observe a traditional Passover Seder meal.\nWhat Does \"Maundy\" Mean?\nDerived from the Latin word mandatum, meaning \"commandment,\" Maundy refers to the commands Jesus gave his disciples at the Last Supper : to love with humility by serving one another and to remember his sacrifice.\nWhen is Maundy Thursday This Year?

                "What is Maundy Thursday? | Bible Gateway Blog\nWhat is Maundy Thursday?\nMel Lawrenz\nMinister at large for Elmbrook Church, and director of The Brook Network.\nToday is Maundy Thursday—the Thursday before Easter. Christians around the world and across many denominations take time on this day to remember the Last Supper, when Jesus and his disciples dined together for the last time before his death. What is the significance of Maundy Thursday for us today? Below, Pastor Mel Lawrenz shares some insight into the meaning of this holiday.\nJesus said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come. A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” ( John 13:31-35 )\nOn this day around the world Christians remember that tense, sensitive time Jesus spent with his disciples in the upper room and the last supper he shared with them. Many refer to this day as “Maundy Thursday.”\nThe word “Maundy” comes from the Latin word for commandment (mandatum), which Jesus talked about when he told his disciples that he was leaving them “a new commandment,” that they “love one another.” There were probably so many things going on in the disciples’ minds in that upper room where they had their last supper together, including fear and bewilderment from Jesus telling them that someone in that very room would betray him.\nJesus handed the betrayer a piece of bread, just as he had been feeding all his disciples all along. Always giving, always gracing. Jesus fed thousands of people with fish and loaves, and every word that came out of his mouth was spiritual food for those who listened and understood. But on this night he fed them differently. Passing the bread, and then the wine, he spoke ominous, comforting words: “this is my body… this is my blood.” This was not an ordinary supper, not even an ordinary Passover. His words connected with what he had said on the shores of far-away Galilee “I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty…. whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day” ( John 6:35, 54 ).\nJesus told them to repeat this unique meal in the future, and then it was time to go out into the chilly night. In a quiet garden among olive trees, quiet but for the deep night sounds of dogs barking in the distance, Jesus prayed. In agony he prayed. The specter of shameful execution and of bearing the curse of sin tore into the human consciousness of Jesus. And in the end it was sheer obedience to the divine plan that carried Jesus into the hands of the conspirators waiting for him. Did the disciples remember “the new command”?\nPonder This: What would have been going on in your mind had you been one of the disciples at the last supper or in the garden of Gethsemane?\nThis is a re-post of an article that originally appeared in 2013.

                "Maundy Thursday - What does it mean? - Christian Teaching - thisischurch.com\nMaundy Thursday\nMaundy Thursday is the Thursday of Holy Week (the Thursday before      Easter). It was the day on which Jesus celebrated the Passover with his      disciples, sharing a meal with them which we call the Last Supper.\nIn those days it was usual for a servant to wash the guests feet on      arrival. On this occasion there was no servant present and none of the      disciples volunteered to do the menial task. Instead, Jesus got up and      washed his disciples feet, giving them an object lesson in humility and      service.\nIn some churches priests carry out a ceremonial washing of the feet of      twelve men on Maundy Thursday as a commemoration of Christ's act.\nIn Britain it is still customary for the sovereign to give 'Maundy Money'      to a number of male and female pensioners - one man and one woman for each      year of the sovereign's age. The money is contained in two purses: one red      and one white. The white purse contains specially minted coins - one for      each year of the sovereign's life. The red purse now also contains money, in      lieu of gifts which used to be offered to the poor. Up to the time of James      II the sovereign also washed the feet of selected poor men.\nThe word \"Maundy\" comes from the Latin for 'command' (mandatum).      It refers to the command given by Jesus at the Last Supper, that his      disciples should love one another.\nThanks to Jeff Osborne for supplying the picture below which shows a bowl      with two platforms.

                "Maundy Thursday and “Holy Week” | Grace Communion International\nWays to Give\nMaundy Thursday and “Holy Week”\nThe calendar or weekly bulletin published by your local congregation might have said the following for Thursday, April 5, 2012:  \nMaundy Thursday: This evening we will have a Communion service with optional footwashing. Services will begin at 7:00 p.m. Please bring your own towel and water pan. This is our annual commemoration of the Last Supper that Jesus Christ had with his disciples. In this service, we along with Christians everywhere remember the meaning of Jesus’ love and his death for our sins.\nChristians who are not familiar with the word “Maundy” might wonder what this means. “Why is ‘Monday’ a Thursday?” someone might ask. Some people mispronounce or misspell “Maundy” as Maunday.” To others, “Maundy” sounds like the gloomy word “maudlin,” as in, “He seems very blue and maudlin today.”\nDay of the Lord’s Supper\nFor another article on this topic, see Footwashing: A Tradition of Service.\nYet, Maundy Thursday evening is a time when Christians partake of bread and wine (the “cup” or “fruit of the vine” as stated in Matthew 26:27, 29). The service is a commemoration of the Last Supper, the oldest and most important Christian commemorative service. Jesus, by his example, instituted the practice of the bread and cup for his disciples during the evening meal with them on the night he was arrested. Christians call the taking of these elements by the terms “Lord’s Supper,” “Communion” or the “Eucharist” (from the Greek, eucharistoun, meaning “thanksgiving”).  Here is the account of Jesus creating a practice for his disciples and the people of God, his church:\nWhile they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.” Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.” [Matthew 26:26-28]\nLuke 22:19 adds Jesus’ statement to the disciples that they should “do this in remembrance” of him. The church did follow Jesus’ example from the beginning, and Christians through the centuries have taken Communion often. It is thought that groups in the earliest church “broke bread” in Communion quite regularly, at least weekly, and in some situations on a daily basis as they ate together. (See Acts 2:42-47, especially verse 46, which describes the fellowship of the earliest believers in Jerusalem.) The apostle Paul gives us the first written account that we have of the church keeping the Lord’s Supper service:\nFor I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. [1 Corinthians 11:23-26]\nNote that the Lord’s Supper service is a remembrance of Jesus’ saving work – a proclamation of his death throughout the history of the church until Jesus’ coming in glory. Paul wrote 1 Corinthians around A.D. 55, so we see the congregation observing Communion about two decades after Jesus’ death, though the practice was evident from the beginning of the church from the Pentecost after Jesus’ death, resurrection and Ascension. Christians were celebrating the Lord’s Supper or Communion on a regular basis throughout the year.\n“Holy Week” festivities described\nIn addition to this, the desire naturally grew among Christians to have a special worship season in the spring to coincide as closely as possible with the time in the year when Jesus offered the bread and wine to his disciples – and when he was betrayed, crucified, buried and resurrected. After all, these were among the most important saving events that God had brought to pass through his Son and our Savior, Jesus Christ.\nWe saw that the apostle Paul described the church’s regular Communion services in memory of Jesus’ death in 1 Corinthians. In the same book he also explained that this event was one of the foundational facts and events of salvation history, tied closely to Jesus’ resurrection:\nFor what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. [1 Corinthians 15:3-5]\nThe Christian church went beyond the simple “breaking of bread” in Communion in its desire to commemorate that which was “of first importance” in Christ in the history of salvation – the Incarnation and birth of Jesus, his coming, his death, resurrection and Ascension. Advent and Christmas, of course, celebrate the Incarnation, birth and coming of Jesus.\nThe Christian church in its desire to worship Jesus and to recall the great saving events in his Person thus formed a tradition of having “Holy Week” services in the spring to commemorate the events surrounding his death and resurrection. To one degree or another, the church has participated in such worship opportunities throughout most of its history.\nThis week of worship begins with Palm Sunday, when Jesus entered Jerusalem amidst a huge demonstration of support by the common people. They erroneously thought he was going to declare himself a Messiah in the tradition of the conquering Maccabees, who had once temporarily restored the glory of the Jewish nation, until it was conquered by the Romans in 63 B.C. Far from being a “triumphant” entry, however, the fanfare on Palm Sunday was the epitome of irony. Those who supported Jesus so openly and vocally would quietly forsake him five days later when he hung on the cross.\n“Holy Week” festivities continue on through the week, culminating in Maundy Thursday, Good Friday[1] and a quiet Saturday, which represents Jesus’ resting in the tomb. “Holy Week” then takes us to Easter Sunday, the great festival of Jesus’ resurrection on Sunday morning, often commemorated in a “sunrise service.” In our day, generally only Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday are times of special observance in most churches, and this culminates in Easter or Resurrection Sunday.\nPerhaps you know of someone who'd like to hear about this article.

We do know, however, that they existed in the church in Jerusalem in the fourth century. The Pilgrimage of Aetheria contains a detailed account of the Christian festivities during the entire time span of Holy Week.\nEvents calendar\nHere’s a summary of traditional Christian worship during Holy Week, and the events in Jesus’ life that are memorialized: \nPalm Sunday: Jesus rides into Jerusalem on a colt (Matthew 21:1-11). He is accompanied by crowds of people who create a path for him with their cloaks and branches cut from trees.\nMonday: Jesus drives the money changers from the temple and spends the night in Bethany (Matthew 21:12-17). \nTuesday and Wednesday: Jesus continues to teach in Jerusalem (Matthew 21:18-26:16). The chief priests and Jewish religious elders form a plot “to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him” (26:1-5). Judas agrees to be a conspirator and to hand Jesus over to them (26:14-16).\nThursday: Jesus has his last meal during his earthly ministry with the disciples. He washes the disciples’ feet and institutes the Lord’s Supper or Communion. After teaching and encouraging them, he goes to Gethsemane, where he prays in anguish. He is arrested by the Jewish temple police and is taken to the Sanhedrin, where he is condemned (Matthew 26:17-75).\nGood Friday: Jesus is shuttled between Pontius Pilate and Herod Antipas. Pilate finally orders Jesus to be beaten and then crucified. Jesus dies in the late afternoon on Friday. Around sunset, Jesus is buried in the tomb (Matthew 27:1-61).\nSaturday: Jesus rests in the tomb (Matthew 27:62-66).\nEaster[2] Sunday: Jesus is resurrected (Matthew 28:1-15).\nTime issues raised\nSome might point to a difficulty in the above chronology. The account in the three synoptic Gospels – Matthew, Mark and Luke – implies, at least on the surface, that Jesus ate his last meal on the Jewish day of Passover. (See Matthew 26:17, for example.) However, John in his Gospel seems to say Jesus ate the supper one day earlier than the Jews ate the Passover meal (John 18:28).\nAlso, Christians who interpret Matthew 12:40 in a strictly literal manner – as 72 hours or three full days – insist that there is not enough time in the Christian Good Friday-Easter Sunday tradition for Jesus to have spent the prescribed time in the tomb. To refresh our memory, here is what Matthew tells us that Jesus said about his burial:\nFor as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\nMost Christians throughout the history of the church have relied on the other 20-plus New Testament references mentioning the length of Jesus’ burial, which allow for his time in the tomb to be much shorter, and hence, to fit into the Good Friday-Easter Sunday tradition.\nIn any case, we need not quibble about these issues of chronology. There is no New Testament command that Christians must have their celebrations on some specific “holy” day, or that such festivities must coincide, time-wise, exactly with the events they memorialize. Holy Week[3]celebrations are not like the Old Testament annual festivals, which God commanded Israel to observe on specific days of the Hebrew calendar.\nWe aren’t obligated to solve these puzzles of chronology in order to worship in the way we do on Maundy Thursday and the rest of Holy Week, that is, to celebrate and participate in the love, death and resurrection of Jesus. Minor questions about time should not distract us and take our attention away from the real focus of our worship during this time – the saving work of Jesus Christ and our participation in his merciful grace towards us.\nAnother issue some raise is whether Christians are allowed to set up their own seasons or days of worship. Some Christians, taking their cue from ancient Israel’s worship system, conclude that we should not be having any remembrance that isn’t specifically commanded by God in the New Testament. As mentioned above, Israel under the old covenant was given seven annual worship festivals to fall on set days of the year that had to be strictly adhered to.\nHowever, as Christians we do have the freedom to set aside special times of worship and remembrance. This is evident by example even in ancient Israel’s worship, in that they added Hanukkah and Purim to the nation’s festival calendar. These days commemorated events that celebrated God’s saving acts in Jewish history. Such worship was acceptable to God, and even though the days were not mandated by Scripture, Jesus participated in them (John 10:22). These examples have led Christians to conclude that the church also has the freedom to add to its religious calendar festivals that celebrate God’s intervention in human affairs in bringing us salvation through the saving acts of Jesus.\nFurther, the Communion Christians participate in on Maundy Thursday does reflect Jesus’ command to take the symbols of the bread and wine in remembrance of him “until he comes.” In all our Christian worship between Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday, the Maundy Thursday Communion is the one celebration that rises to the status of sacrament, precisely because Jesus instituted it. The celebration is also the oldest in the Christian tradition as it goes back to the beginning of the church.\nMeaning of “Maundy”\nThat being so, why is the day of Jesus’ final supper and his institution of the bread and wine service called “Maundy Thursday”? Why not “Last Supper Thursday,” “Lord’s Supper Thursday” or “Communion Thursday,” to give three examples of possible substitute titles? No doubt, some other name might be more descriptive and meaningful in our modern age, but once we understand what “Maundy” signifies, we’ll see that it is an apt term to use for our celebration. In fact, Maundy Thursday is more than just about Communion, though that is certainly the important event.\nThe word “Maundy” is generally thought to refer to the word “commandment” in Jesus’ command for his disciples to love each other. That being so, the word “Maundy” tells us why it is possible for us to partake of Jesus’ death and life; it is through the love God has for us.\nThe name of the Thursday of Holy Week – Maundy – is derived from the Latin word mandatum, or command. Hence, the English word “mandate,” or commandment. The idea in “Maundy” is based on the command Jesus gave his disciples at the last evening meal of his earthly ministry, “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another” (John 13:34-35). In Latin “a new commandment  I give you” is Mandatum novum do vobis. And that is why the celebration day is called “Maundy Thursday” – or “Holy Thursday,” as it is known outside English-speaking nations. Footwashing, included in some Maundy Thursday services, is simply one illustration of how Christians are to love and humbly serve one another.\nIt is because God loved us in his freedom that he came in Jesus to save us through his death and resurrection. We read in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” God, because of his love, sent his Son to save the world through him. Jesus’ death is the ultimate expression of this love. Jesus also said: “Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command” (John 15:13). Here, again, is command – mandatum – Maundy.\nBoth the bread and wine, symbolizing the body and blood of Jesus given for us, and his washing of the disciples’ feet are acts of love in service to others. It is love that lies behind the acts that Jesus performed during Holy Week – the love of God – for us. And Jesus’ command to us is to love God above all and to love each other as he loved us (John 15:12). Thus “Maundy Thursday,” or to say it in modern English – “Love Command Thursday” – is a perfectly appropriate term to use in summarizing what should be our response to the love and grace of Jesus in his death for our sinfulness.\nAdditional reading\nCalendar: Christ’s Time for the Church, by Laurence Hull Stookey (Nashville, Tennessee: Abingdon Press, 1996. Stookey discusses the theological meaning of the Christian liturgical calendar. He explains how we can benefit from understanding the purpose and themes behind our celebration of the great events of salvation history in Christ.\n[1] Why do we call the day “Good Friday,” when that is the day on which Jesus suffered? The reason the phrase seems to be a problem is because, “Emphasis has been on the seemingly senseless human suffering of Jesus rather than on the purposeful humiliation of God through which redemption comes,” says Laurence Hull Stookey on page 96 of Calendar: Christ’s Time for the Church. “In other words,” Stookey continues, “we have failed once again to read the sacred story backward. Friday has been observed as if Sunday had never come.”\n[2] Many Christians do not know that Easter, in addition to being a day, is also a memorial season of 50 days, culminating in the Christian Pentecost, when Jesus sent the Holy Spirit and the church began.\n“Easter” is an unfortunate term because it has no known direct Christian meaning, unless it derives from an Old German root, ostern, for dawn or east, which is the time and place of the rising sun. Thus it would demonstrate a connection to Jesus’ resurrection before dawn on Sunday.  Among Western languages, only English and German have not preserved some form of “Pasch” as their word for Resurrection Sunday. Paul refers to Jesus as our “paschal lamb in 1 Corinthians 5:7, so that the word at least has a direct and known connection with Jesus.\n[3] In this context, we should understand that the term “Holy Week” does not imply that there is some inherent holiness in the period of time during which Christians celebrate the events of salvation in the spring, as though God commands us to set aside these days for worship. Holy Week is a “holy” week only in that Christians have chosen to recall a number of saving events in the life of Jesus during this time of the year, by setting the days aside for special worship.",
                "What Is Maundy Thursday? (Meaning and Origin of the Term)\nBy Scott P. Richert\nUpdated October 27, 2016.\nMaundy Thursday is a common and popular name for Holy Thursday , the Thursday before Easter Sunday . Maundy Thursday gets its name from the Latin word mandatum, which means \"commandment.\"\nOn Maundy Thursday, the Catholic Church commemorates Christ's Last Supper, at which He instituted the Eucharist , the Mass , and the priesthood . Since 1969, Maundy Thursday has marked the end of the liturgical season of Lent in the Catholic Church ( though not of the Lenten fast ).\nWhen Is Maundy Thursday?\nYou can find the date of Maundy Thursday in this and future years in  When Is Holy Thursday?\nPronunciation: ˈmôndē ˈθərzˌdā\nCommon Misspellings: Maunday Thursday, Monday Thursday\nExample: \"On Maundy Thursday, our priest washes the feet of 12 men at the Mass of the Lord's Supper.\"\nThe Origin of the Term\nNear the end of the Last Supper, after Judas had departed, Christ said to His disciples, \"I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another\" ( John 13:34 ).\nIn Latin, the word for commandment is mandatum. The Latin term became the Middle English word Maundy by way of the Old French mande.\nRelated Terms\nThe name Maundy Thursday is today more common among Protestants than among Catholics, who tend to use Holy Thursday, while Eastern Catholics and Eastern Orthodox refer to Maundy Thursday as Great and Holy Thursday. \nMaundy Thursday is the first day of the Easter Triduum , the final three days of the 40 days of Lent before Easter. Holy Thursday is the high point of Holy Week or Passiontide .\nMaundy Thursday Traditions\nThe Catholic Church lives out Christ's commandment to love one another in a number of ways through her traditions on Maundy Thursday. The best known is the washing of the feet of laymen by their priest during the Mass of the Lord's Supper, which recalls Christ's own washing of the feet of His disciples ( John 13:1-11 ).\nMaundy Thursday was also the day on which those who needed to be reconciled to the Church in order to receive Holy Communion on Easter Sunday would be absolved from their sins. And as early as the fifth century, it became the custom for the bishop to consecrate the holy oil or chrism for all of the churches of his diocese. This chrism is used in baptisms and confirmations throughout the year, but especially at the Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday , when those who are converting to Catholicism are welcomed into the Church.\nMaundy Thursday in Other Countries and Cultures\nAs with the rest of Lent and the Easter season , the traditions surrounding Maundy Thursday vary from country to country and culture to culture.

The white purse contains one coin for each year of the monarch's reign.\nThe red purse contains money in place of other gifts that used to be given to the poor.\nIn the 17th century, and earlier, the King or Queen would wash the feet of the selected poor people as a gesture of humility, and in remembrance of Jesus' washing the feet of the disciples.

The service traditionally begins outside the church, where minister and some worshippers gather around a fire - a charcoal brazier is common.\nThe service begins with words like these:\nBrothers and sisters in Christ, on this most holy night, in which our Lord Jesus Christ passed over from death to life, the Church invites her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in vigil and prayer.\nFor this is the Passover of the Lord, in which through word and sacrament we share in his victory over death.\nTraditional Easter vigil liturgy\nAfter readings and prayers, the Paschal candle is lit from the fire using a taper, while a prayer like the one below is said.\nMay the light of Christ, rising in glory, banish all darkness from our hearts and minds.\nTraditional Easter vigil prayer\nThe lit candle is now a symbol of Christ, risen as the light of the world, and come into the midst of the people.\nClergyman lighting the Paschal candle ©\nAfter being lit outside, the candle is carried into the church, where most of the worshippers are waiting in darkness, which symbolises the darkness of Christ's tomb.\nAfter more prayers and readings, the candles held by the congregation are lit from the Paschal candle.\nThe symbolism of the candle is made very clear by words such as...\nGrant that this Easter candle make our darkness light; for Christ the morning star has risen, never again to set, and is alive and reigns for ever and ever.\nTraditional Easter vigil service\nThe readings at the service tell of the creation of humanity, how humanity fell from grace, and was repeatedly rescued by God. The readings remind people of God's promise to be with them always.\nThe Paschal candle\nPaschal candle ©\nThe Paschal candle is made of pure white wax and is marked with a cross, an Alpha, and an Omega, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. The 4 numbers of the year are marked between the arms. This symbolises that Christ has been, is now and always will be with humanity.\nPaschal candles are usually large, and can cost over £100. For much of the year many churches stand the paschal candle near the font used for baptisms. Here it provides a reminder that baptism is a symbolic death and rebirth with Christ; just like Christ's death and Resurrection .\nHoly Saturday is followed by Easter Sunday ."

The official title of the President of Iceland (Forseti Íslands) does also not include the word republic as in some other republics. See Names for Iceland. is a Nordic island country between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. It has a population of  and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.\n\nAccording to Landnámabók, the settlement of Iceland began in the year AD 874 when the Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island. In the following centuries, mainly Norwegians and to a smaller extent other Scandinavians settled Iceland, bringing with them thralls of Gaelic origin. From 1262 to 1814, Iceland was ruled by Norway and afterwards by Denmark. Until the 20th century, the country relied largely on fishing and agriculture. Iceland became independent in 1918 and a republic in 1944. Industrialisation of the fisheries and Marshall Plan aid following World War II brought prosperity and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the European Economic Area, which supported diversification into economic and financial services.\n\nIceland has a market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other OECD countries.  It maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens.  Iceland ranks high in economic, political and social stability and equality. In 2013, it was ranked as the 13th most-developed country in the world by the United Nations' Human Development Index. Iceland runs almost completely on renewable energy. Affected by the ongoing worldwide financial crisis, the nation's entire banking system systemically failed in October 2008, leading to a severe depression, substantial political unrest, the Icesave dispute, and the institution of capital controls. Many bankers were jailed  and the economy has made a significant recovery, in large part due to a surge in tourism.   \n\nIcelandic culture is founded upon the nation's Scandinavian heritage. Most Icelanders are descendants of Germanic and Gaelic (Celtic) settlers. Icelandic, a North Germanic language, is descended from Old Norse and is closely related to Faroese and West Norwegian dialects. The country's cultural heritage includes traditional Icelandic cuisine, Icelandic literature and medieval sagas. Iceland has the smallest population of any NATO member and is the only one with no standing army, its lightly armed coast guard being in charge of defence. \n\nHistory\n\nSettlement and Commonwealth 874–1262\n\nAccording to both Landnámabók and Íslendingabók, Celtic monks known as the Papar lived in Iceland before Scandinavian settlers arrived, possibly members of a Hiberno-Scottish mission. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula. Carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880. \n\nSwedish Viking explorer Garðar Svavarsson was the first to circumnavigate Iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island.  He stayed over winter and built a house in Húsavík. Garðar departed the following summer but one of his men, Náttfari, decided to stay behind with two slaves. Náttfari settled in what is now known as Náttfaravík and he and his slaves became the first permanent residents of Iceland.  \n\nThe Norwegian-Norse chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson built his homestead in present-day Reykjavík in the year 874. Ingólfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers, largely Scandinavians and their thralls, many of whom were Irish or Scottish.  By 930, most arable land on the island had been claimed; the Althing, a legislative and judicial assembly, was initiated to regulate the Icelandic Commonwealth. Lack of arable land also served impetus to the settlement of Greenland starting in 986.  The period of these early settlements coincided with the Medieval Warm Period, when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century.  At this time, about 25% of Iceland was covered with forest, compared to 1% in the present day.  Christianity was adopted by consensus around 999–1000, although Norse paganism persisted among some segments of the population for some years afterwards.\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nThe Icelandic Commonwealth lasted until the 13th century, when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains.  The internal struggles and civil strife of the Age of the Sturlungs led to the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown. Possession of Iceland passed from the Norwegian Empire to the Kalmar Union in 1415, when the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark and Sweden were united. After the break-up of the union in 1523, it remained a Norwegian dependency, as a part of Denmark–Norway.\n\nIn the ensuing centuries, Iceland became one of the poorest countries in Europe. Infertile soil, volcanic eruptions, deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture. The Black Death swept Iceland twice, first in 1402–1404 and again in 1494–1495.  The former outbreak killed 50% to 60% of the population, and the latter 30% to 50%. \n\nReformation and the Early Modern period\n\nAround the middle of the 16th century, as part of the Protestant Reformation, King Christian III of Denmark began to impose Lutheranism on all his subjects. Jón Arason, the last Catholic bishop of Hólar, was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons. The country subsequently became officially Lutheran and Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Denmark imposed harsh trade restrictions on Iceland. Natural disasters, including volcanic eruption and disease, contributed to a decreasing population. Pirates from several countries, including the Barbary Coast, raided its coastal settlements and abducted people into slavery.   A great smallpox epidemic in the 18th century killed around a third of the population.   In 1783 the Laki volcano erupted, with devastating effects.  In the years following the eruption, known as the Mist Hardships (Icelandic: Móðuharðindin), over half of all livestock died in the country. Around a quarter of the population died in the ensuing famine. \n\nIndependence movement 1814–1918\n\nIn 1814, following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark-Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the Treaty of Kiel but Iceland remained a Danish dependency. Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow colder, resulting in mass emigration to the New World, particularly to the region of Gimli, Manitoba in Canada, which was sometimes referred to as New Iceland. About 15,000 people emigrated, out of a total population of 70,000. \n\nA national consciousness arose in the first half of the 19th century, inspired by romantic and nationalist ideas from mainland Europe. An Icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of Jón Sigurðsson, based on the burgeoning Icelandic nationalism inspired by the Fjölnismenn and other Danish-educated Icelandic intellectuals. In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and limited home rule. This was expanded in 1904, and Hannes Hafstein served as the first Minister for Iceland in the Danish cabinet.\n\nKingdom of Iceland 1918–1944\n\nThe Danish–Icelandic Act of Union, an agreement with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25 years, recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign state in a personal union with Denmark. The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark handle Icelandic foreign policy. Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the Kingdom of Iceland.\n\nDuring World War II, Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality. After the German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Althing replaced the King with a regent and declared that the Icelandic government would take control of foreign affairs and other matters previously handled by Denmark. A month later, British armed forces invaded and occupied the country, violating Icelandic neutrality. In 1941, the occupation was taken over by the United States so that Britain could use its troops elsewhere.\n\nIndependent republic 1944–present\n\nOn 31 December 1943, the Danish–Icelandic Act of Union expired after 25 years. Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with Denmark, abolish the monarchy, and establish a republic. The vote was 97% to end the union, and 95% in favour of the new republican constitution.  Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944, with Sveinn Björnsson as its first president.\n\nIn 1946, the Allied occupation force left Iceland. The nation formally became a member of NATO on 30 March 1949, amid domestic controversy and riots. On 5 May 1951, a defence agreement was signed with the United States. American troops returned to Iceland as the Iceland Defence Force, and remained throughout the Cold War. The US withdrew the last of its forces on 30 September 2006.\n\nIceland had prospered during the war. The immediate post-war period was followed by substantial economic growth, driven by industrialisation of the fishing industry and the US Marshall Plan programme, through which Icelanders received the most aid per capita of any European country (at USD 209, with the war-ravaged Netherlands a distant second at USD 109).  \n\nThe 1970s were marked by the Cod Wars — several disputes with the United Kingdom over Iceland's extension of its fishing limits to 200 miles offshore. Iceland hosted a summit in Reykjavík in 1986 between United States President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, during which they took significant steps toward nuclear disarmament. A few years later, Iceland became the first country to recognize the independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as they broke away from the USSR. Throughout the 1990s, the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented toward humanitarian and peacekeeping causes. To that end, Iceland provided aid and expertise to various NATO-led interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq. \n\nIceland joined the European Economic Area in 1994, after which the economy was greatly diversified and liberalised. International economic relations increased further after 2001, when Iceland's newly deregulated banks began to raise massive amounts of external debt, contributing to a 32% increase in Iceland's gross national income between 2002 and 2007. \n\nEconomic boom and crisis\n\nIn the years 2003–2007, following the privatization of the banking sector under the government of Davíð Oddsson, Iceland moved toward having an economy based on international investment banking and financial services. It was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world but was hit hard by a major financial crisis. The crisis resulted in the greatest migration from Iceland since 1887, with a net emigration of 5,000 people in 2009. Iceland's economy stabilised under the government of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, and grew by 1.6% in 2012.  Many Icelanders, however, have remained unhappy with the state of the economy and government austerity policies. The centre-right Independence Party was returned to power in coalition with the Progressive Party in the 2013 elections. \n\nGeography\n\nIceland is at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The main island is entirely south of the Arctic Circle, which passes through the small Icelandic island of Grímsey off the main island's northern coast. The country lies between latitudes 63° and 68° N, and longitudes 25° and 13° W.\n\nIceland is closer to continental Europe than to mainland North America; thus, the island is generally included in Europe for historical, political, cultural, and practical reasons. Geologically the island includes parts of both continental plates. The closest body of land is Greenland (). The closest bodies of land in Europe are the Faroe Islands (); Jan Mayen Island (); Shetland and the Outer Hebrides, both about ; and the Scottish mainland and Orkney, both about . The mainland of Norway is about  away.\n\nIceland is the world's 18th largest island, and Europe's second largest island after Great Britain. The main island is , but the entire country is  in size, of which 62.7% is tundra. There are thirty minor islands in Iceland, including the lightly populated Grímsey and the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago. Lakes and glaciers cover 14.3% of its surface; only 23% is vegetated.  The largest lakes are Þórisvatn reservoir:  and Þingvallavatn: ; other important lakes include Lagarfljót and Mývatn. Jökulsárlón is the deepest lake, at . \n\nGeologically, Iceland is part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a ridge along which the oceanic crust spreads and forms new oceanic crust. This part of the mid-ocean ridge is located above a mantle plume, causing Iceland to be subaerial (above the surface of the sea). The ridge marks the boundary between the Eurasian and North American Plates, and Iceland was created by rifting and accretion through volcanism along the ridge. \n\nMany fjords punctuate Iceland's 4,970-kilometre (3,088-mile) long coastline, which is also where most settlements are situated. The island's interior, the Highlands of Iceland, is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand, mountains and lava fields. The major towns are the capital city of Reykjavík, along with its outlying towns of Kópavogur, Hafnarfjörður and Garðabær, nearby Reykjanesbær where the international airport is located, and the town of Akureyri in northern Iceland. The island of Grímsey on the Arctic Circle contains the northernmost habitation of Iceland, whereas Kolbeinsey contains the northernmost point of Iceland.  Iceland has three national parks: Vatnajökull National Park, Snæfellsjökull National Park, and Þingvellir National Park.  The country is considered a \"strong performer\" in environmental protection, having been ranked 13th in Yale University's Environmental Performance Index of 2012. \n\nIceland satellite.jpg | Iceland, as seen from space on 29 January 2004\nIceland2008-Sudureyri.JPG | Suðureyri\nNorðfjörður .JPG | Norðfjörður\nEyjafjallajokull-April-17.JPG | The eruption of Eyjafjallajökull\nISLANDIA.jpg | South of Iceland, off the Ring Road, looking north, late afternoon in winter 2001\n\nGeology\n\nA geologically young land, Iceland is located on both the Iceland hotspot and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs right through it. This location means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes, notably Hekla, Eldgjá, Herðubreið and Eldfell.  The volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783–1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island's population.  In addition, the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for several months afterward, and affected climates in other areas. \n\nIceland has many geysers, including Geysir, from which the English word is derived, and the famous Strokkur, which erupts every 8–10 minutes. After a phase of inactivity, Geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000. Geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often. \n\nWith the widespread availability of geothermal power, and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity, most residents have access to inexpensive hot water, heating and electricity. The island is composed primarily of basalt, a low-silica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in Hawaii. Iceland, however, has a variety of volcanic types (composite and fissure), many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite. Iceland has hundreds of volcanoes with approx. 30 volcanic systems active. \n\nSurtsey, one of the youngest islands in the world, is part of Iceland. Named after Surtr, it rose above the ocean in a series of volcanic eruptions between 8 November 1963 and 5 June 1968. Only scientists researching the growth of new life are allowed to visit the island. \n\nOn 21 March 2010, a volcano in Eyjafjallajökull in the south of Iceland erupted for the first time since 1821, forcing 600 people to flee their homes.  Additional eruptions on 14 April forced hundreds of people to abandon their homes.  The resultant cloud of volcanic ash brought major disruption to air travel across Europe. \n\nAnother large eruption occurred on 21 May 2011. This time it was the Grímsvötn volcano, located under the thick ice of Europe's largest glacier, Vatnajökull. Grímsvötn is one of Iceland's most active volcanoes, and this eruption was much more powerful than the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull activity, with ash and lava  hurled into the atmosphere creating a large cloud.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of Iceland's coast is subpolar oceanic. The warm North Atlantic Current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world. Regions in the world with similar climates include the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Peninsula, and Tierra del Fuego, although these regions are closer to the equator. Despite its proximity to the Arctic, the island's coasts remain ice-free through the winter. Ice incursions are rare, the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969. \n\nThe climate varies between different parts of the island. Generally speaking, the south coast is warmer, wetter and windier than the north. The Central Highlands are the coldest part of the country. Low-lying inland areas in the north are the most arid. Snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south.\n\nThe highest air temperature recorded was  on 22 June 1939 at Teigarhorn on the southeastern coast. The lowest was  on 22 January 1918 at Grímsstaðir and Möðrudalur in the northeastern hinterland. The temperature records for Reykjavík are  on 30 July 2008, and  on 21 January 1918.\n\nBiodiversity\n\nThere are around 1,300 known species of insects in Iceland, which is low compared with other countries (over one million species have been described worldwide). The only native land mammal when humans arrived was the Arctic fox,  which came to the island at the end of the ice age, walking over the frozen sea. On rare occasions, bats have been carried to the island with the winds, but they are not able to breed there. Polar bears occasionally come over from Greenland, but they are just visitors, and no Icelandic populations exist.  There are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island. \n\nPhytogeographically, Iceland belongs to the Arctic province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. Approximately three quarters of the island are barren of vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland, which is regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Iceland is the northern birch (Betula pubescens), which formerly formed forests over much of Iceland, along with aspens (Populus tremula), rowans (Sorbus aucuparia), common junipers (Juniperus communis) and other smaller trees, mainly willows.\n\nWhen the island was first settled, it was extensively forested. In the late 12th century, Ari the Wise described it in the Íslendingabók as \"forested from mountain to sea shore\".  Permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin, volcanic soils and limited species diversity. The forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber. Deforestation, climatic deterioration during the Little Ice Age and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to erosion. Today, many farms have been abandoned. Three quarters of Iceland's 100,000 square kilometres are affected by soil erosion, 18000 km2 so seriously as to be useless. Only a few small birch stands now exist in isolated reserves. The planting of new forests has increased the number of trees, but the result does not compare to the original forests. Some of the planted forests include introduced species. The tallest tree in Iceland is a sitka spruce planted in 1949 in Kirkjubæjarklaustur; it was measured at  in 2013. \n\nThe animals of Iceland include the Icelandic sheep, cattle, chickens, goats, the sturdy Icelandic horse, and the Icelandic Sheepdog, all descendants of animals imported by Europeans. Wild mammals include the Arctic fox, mink, mice, rats, rabbits and reindeer. Polar bears occasionally visit the island, travelling on icebergs from Greenland. In June 2008, two polar bears arrived in the same month.  Marine mammals include the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Many species of fish live in the ocean waters surrounding Iceland, and the fishing industry is a major part of Iceland's economy, accounting for approximately half of the country's total exports. Birds, especially seabirds, are an important part of Iceland's animal life. Puffins, skuas, and kittiwakes nest on its sea cliffs. \n\nCommercial whaling is practised intermittently  along with scientific whale hunts.  Whale watching has become an important part of Iceland's economy since 1997. \n\nPolitics\n\nIceland has a left–right multi-party system. Following the 2013 parliamentary election, the biggest parties are the centre-right Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn) and the Progressive Party (Framsóknarflokkurinn). Other political parties with seats in the Althing are the centre-left Social Democratic Alliance (Samfylkingin), Left-Green Movement (Vinstrihreyfingin – grænt framboð), Bright Future (Björt framtíð), and the Pirate Party of Iceland (Píratar). Many other parties exist on the municipal level, most of which run only locally in a single municipality.\n\nIceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women.  Known as the Women's List or Women's Alliance (Kvennalistinn), it was founded in 1983 to advance the political, economic, and social needs of women. After participating in its first parliamentary elections, the Women's List helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15%.  Although it disbanded in 1999, merging with the Social Democratic Alliance, it left a lasting influence on Iceland's politics: every major party has a 40% quota for women, and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female, compared to the global average of 16%. \n\nIn 2011 Iceland was ranked 2nd in the strength of its democratic institutions  and 13th in government transparency.  The country has a high level of civic participation, with 81.4% voter turnout during the most recent elections,  compared to an OECD average of 72%. However, only 50% of Icelanders say they trust their political institutions, slightly less than the OECD average of 56% (and most probably a consequence of the political scandals in the wake of the Icelandic financial crisis).[http://oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/iceland/ Iceland – OECD Better Life Index]. Oecdbetterlifeindex.org. Retrieved 28 April 2012.\n\nGovernment\n\nIceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic. The modern parliament, Alþingi (English: Althing), was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch. It was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the Commonwealth period and suspended in 1799. Consequently, \"it is arguably the world's oldest parliamentary democracy.\"  It currently has 63 members, elected for a maximum period of four years.  The president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years, with no term limit. The elections for president, the Althing and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years. \n\nThe president of Iceland is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat, but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum. The current president is Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson. The head of government is the prime minister who, together with the cabinet, is responsible for executive government. The cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing; however, the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed, under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing. Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally. This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 regent Sveinn Björnsson, who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941, appointed a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Sveinn would later become the country's first president in 1944.\n\nThe governments of Iceland have always been coalition governments, with two or more parties involved, as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period. The extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars, in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently. In 1980, Icelanders elected Vigdís Finnbogadóttir as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state. She retired from office in 1996. In 2009, Iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir became prime minister. \n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nIceland is divided into regions, constituencies and municipalities. There are eight regions which are primarily used for statistical purposes; the district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division. Until 2003, the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions, but by an amendment to the constitution, they were changed to the current six constituencies:\n* Reykjavík North and Reykjavík South (city regions);\n* Southwest (four non-contiguous suburban areas around Reykjavík);\n* Northwest and Northeast (northern half of Iceland, split); and,\n* South (southern half of Iceland, excluding Reykjavík and suburbs).\n\nThe redistricting change was made in order to balance the weight of different districts of the country, since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the Reykjavík city area. The imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system, but still exists.\n\nThere are 74 municipalities in Iceland which govern local matters like schools, transport and zoning.  These are the actual second-level subdivisions of Iceland, as the constituencies have no relevance except in elections and for statistical purposes. Reykjavík is by far the most populous municipality, about four times more populous than Kópavogur, the second one.\n\nRegions of Iceland.png|Regions of Iceland\nConstituencies Iceland.png|Constituencies of Iceland\nSveitarfélög-landsvæði.png|Municipalities of Iceland\n\nForeign relations\n\nIceland, which is a member of the UN, NATO, EFTA, Council of Europe and OECD, maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations, but its ties with the Nordic countries, Germany, the United States, Canada and the other NATO nations are particularly close. Historically, due to cultural, economic and linguistic similarities, Iceland is a Nordic country, and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the Nordic Council.\n\nIceland is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), which allows the country access to the single market of the European Union (EU). It was not a member of the EU, but in July 2009 the Icelandic parliament, the Althing, voted in favour of application for EU membership  and officially applied on 17 July 2009.  However, in 2013, opinion polls showed that many Icelanders were now against joining the EU; following recent elections the two parties that formed the island's new government – the centrist Progressive Party and the right-wing Independence Party – announced they would hold a referendum on EU membership. \n\nMilitary\n\nIceland has no standing army. The U.S. Air Force maintained four to six interceptor aircraft at the Keflavík base, until they were withdrawn on 30 September 2006. Since May 2008, NATO nations have periodically deployed fighters to patrol Icelandic airspace under the Icelandic Air Policing mission. Iceland supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq despite much domestic controversy, deploying a Coast Guard EOD team to Iraq which was replaced later by members of the Iceland Crisis Response Unit. Iceland has also participated in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Despite the ongoing financial crisis the first new patrol ship in decades was launched on 29 April 2009.\n\nIcelanders remain especially proud of their role in hosting the historic 1986 Reagan–Gorbachev summit in Reykjavík, which set the stage for the end of the Cold War. Iceland's principal historical international disputes involved disagreements over fishing rights. Conflict with the United Kingdom led to a series of so-called Cod Wars in 1952–1956 due to the extension of Iceland's fishing zone from , 1958–1961 following a further extension to , 1972–1973 with another extension to ; and in 1975–1976 another extension to .\n\nAccording to the Global Peace Index, Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world, due to its lack of armed forces, low crime rate, and high level of socio-political stability. \n\nEconomy\n\nIn 2007, Iceland was the seventh most productive country in the world per capita (US$54,858), and the fifth most productive by GDP at purchasing power parity ($40,112). About 85 percent of total primary energy supply in Iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources.  Utilization of abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power has made Iceland the world's largest electricity producer per capita.  As a result of its commitment to renewable energy, the 2014 Global Green Economy Index ranked Iceland among the top 10 greenest economies in the world.\nHistorically, Iceland's economy depended heavily on fishing, which still provides 40% of export earnings and employs 7% of the work force. The economy is vulnerable to declining fish stocks and drops in world prices for its main material exports: fish and fish products, aluminium, and ferrosilicon. Whaling in Iceland has been historically significant. Iceland still relies heavily on fishing, but its importance is diminishing from an export share of 90% in the 1960s to 40% in 2006. \n\nUntil the 20th century, Iceland was among the poorest countries in Western Europe. Currently, it remains one of the most developed countries in the world. Strong economic growth had led Iceland to be ranked first in the United Nations' Human Development Index report for 2007/2008, although in 2011 its HDI rating had fallen to 14th place as a result of the economic crisis. Nevertheless, according to the Economist Intelligence Index of 2011, Iceland has the 2nd highest quality of life in the world.  Based on the Gini coefficient, Iceland also has one of the lowest rates of income inequality in the world, and when adjusted for inequality, its HDI ranking climbs to 5th place.  Iceland's unemployment rate has declined consistently since the crisis, with 4.8% of the labour force being unemployed as of June 2012, compared to 6% in 2011 and 8.1% in 2010.  \n\nMany political parties remain opposed to EU membership, primarily due to Icelanders' concern about losing control over their natural resources (particularly fisheries).  The national currency of Iceland is the Icelandic króna (ISK). Nearly 70% of Icelanders have favoured the adoption of the Canadian dollar (CAD) - more than any other currency in the world. \n\nA poll released on 5 March 2010 by Capacent Gallup showed that 31% of respondents were in favour of adopting the euro and 69% opposed.  Another Capacent Gallup poll conducted in February 2012 found that 67.4% of Icelanders would reject EU membership in a referendum. \n\nIceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, including software production, biotechnology, and finance; industry accounts for around a quarter of economic activity, while services comprise close to 70%.  Despite the decision to resume commercial whale hunting in 2006, the tourism sector is expanding, especially in ecotourism and whale-watching. On average, Iceland receives around 1.1 million visitors annually, which is more than three times the native population. Iceland's agriculture industry, accounting for 5.4% of GDP, consists mainly of potatoes, green vegetables (in greenhouses), mutton and dairy products. The financial centre is Borgartún in Reykjavík, which hosts a large number of companies and three investment banks. Iceland's stock market, the Iceland Stock Exchange (ISE), was established in 1985. \n\nIceland is ranked 27th in the 2012 Index of Economic Freedom, lower than in prior years but still among the freest in the world.  , it ranks 29th in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitive Index, one place lower than in 2015.  According to INSEAD's Global Innovation Index, Iceland is the 11th most innovative country in the world.  Unlike most Western European countries, Iceland has a flat tax system: the main personal income tax rate is a flat 22.75%, and combined with municipal taxes, the total tax rate equals no more than 35.7%, not including the many deductions that are available. The corporate tax rate is a flat 18%, one of the lowest in the world. There is also a value added tax, whereas a net wealth tax was eliminated in 2006. Employment regulations are relatively flexible and the labour market is one of the freest in the world. Property rights are strong and Iceland is one of the few countries where they are applied to fishery management. Like other welfare states, taxpayers pay various subsidies to each other, but with spending being less than in most European countries.\n\nDespite low tax rates, agricultural assistance is the highest among OECD countries and a potential impediment to structural change. Also, health care and education spending have relatively poor returns by OECD measures, though improvements have been made in both areas. The OECD Economic Survey of Iceland 2008 had highlighted Iceland's challenges in currency and macroeconomic policy.  There was a currency crisis that started in the spring of 2008, and on 6 October trading in Iceland's banks was suspended as the government battled to save the economy.  The latest assessment by the OECD  determined that Iceland has made progress in many areas, particularly in creating a sustainable fiscal policy and restoring the health of the financial sector; however, challenges remain in making the fishing industry more efficient and sustainable, as well as in improving monetary policy in order to address inflation.  Iceland's public debt has decreased since the economic crisis, and  is the 31th highest in the world by proportion of national GDP. \n\nEconomic contraction\n\nIceland had been hit especially hard by the Great Recession that began in December 2007, because of the failure of its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis. Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of €14 billion ($19 billion).  In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the Financial crisis. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks.  Icelandic officials, including central bank governor Davíð Oddsson, stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks' foreign debts or assets. Instead, new banks were established to take on the domestic operations of the banks, and the old banks will be run into bankruptcy.\n\nOn 28 October 2008, the Icelandic government raised interest rates to 18% (as of August 2010, it was 7%), a move which was forced in part by the terms of acquiring a loan from International Monetary Fund (IMF). After the rate hike, trading on the Icelandic króna finally resumed on the open market, with valuation at around 250 ISK per Euro, less than one-third the value of the 1:70 exchange rate during most of 2008, and a significant drop from the 1:150 exchange ratio of the week before. On 20 November 2008, the Nordic countries agreed to lend Iceland $2.5 billion. \n\nOn 26 January 2009, the coalition government collapsed due to the public dissent over the handling of the financial crisis. A new left-wing government was formed a week later and immediately set about removing Central Bank governor Davíð Oddsson and his aides from the bank through changes in law. Davíð was removed on 26 February 2009 in the wake of protests outside the Central Bank. \n\nThousands of Icelanders have moved from the country after the collapse, and many of those moved to Norway. In 2005, 293 people moved from Iceland to Norway; in 2009, the figure was 1,625.  In April 2010, the Icelandic Parliament‘s Special Investigation Commission published the findings of its investigation,  revealing the extent of control fraud in this crisis.  By June 2012, Landsbanki managed to repay about half of the Icesave debt. \n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Iceland is on the trajectory of 2% unemployment as a result of crisis-management decisions made back in 2008, including allowing the banks to fail. \n\nTransport\n\nIceland has a high level of car ownership per capita; with a car for every 1.5 inhabitants; it is the main form of transport.  Iceland has  of administered roads, of which  are paved and  are not. A great number of roads remain unpaved, mostly little-used rural roads. The road speed limits are  in towns,  on gravel country roads and  on hard-surfaced roads.  Iceland currently has no railways.\n\nRoute 1, or the Ring Road (Icelandic: Þjóðvegur 1 or Hringvegur), was completed in 1974, and is a main road that runs around Iceland and connects all the inhabited parts of the island, with the interior of the island being uninhabited. This paved road is   long with one lane in each direction, except near larger towns and cities and in the Hvalfjörður Tunnel (also the site of a toll) where it has more lanes. Many bridges on it, especially in the north and east, are single lane and made of timber and/or steel.\n\nThe main hub for international transport is Keflavík International Airport, which serves Reykjavík and the country in general. It is  to the west of Reykjavík. Domestic flights, flights to Greenland and the Faroe Islands, and business flights operate mostly out of Reykjavík Airport, which lies in the city centre. Most general aviation traffic is also in Reykjavík. There are 103 registered airports and airfields in Iceland; most of them are unpaved and located in rural areas. The biggest airport in Iceland is Keflavík International Airport and the biggest airfield is Geitamelur, a four-runway field around  east of Reykjavík, dedicated exclusively to gliding. There are a number of international airlines that fly to and from Iceland regularly. \n\nEnergy\n\nRenewable sources—geothermal and hydropower—provide effectively all of Iceland's electricity and around 85% of the nation's total primary energy consumption,  with most of the remainder consisting of imported oil products used in transportation and in the fishing fleet.   Iceland expects to be energy-independent by 2050. Iceland's largest geothermal power plants are Hellisheiði and Nesjavellir,   while Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant is the country's largest hydroelectric power station.  When the Kárahnjúkavirkjun started operating, Iceland became the world's largest electricity producer per capita. \n\nIcelanders emit 6.29 tonnes of CO2 in 2009 equivalent of greenhouse gases per capita.  Iceland is one of the few countries that have filling stations dispensing hydrogen fuel for cars powered by fuel cells. It is also one of a few countries currently capable of producing hydrogen in adequate quantities at a reasonable cost, because of Iceland's plentiful renewable sources of energy.\n\nOn 22 January 2009, Iceland announced its first round of offshore licences for companies wanting to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and production in a region northeast of Iceland, known as the Dreki area.  Two exploration licenses have been awarded. \n\n, the government of Iceland is in talks with the government of United Kingdom about the possibility of constructing a high-voltage direct-current connector for transmission of electricity between the two countries.  Such a cable would give Iceland access to a market where electricity prices have generally been much higher than those in Iceland.  Iceland has considerable renewable energy resources, especially geothermal energy and hydropower resources,  and most of the potential has not been developed, partly because there is not enough demand for additional electricity generation capacity from the residents and industry of Iceland, but the United Kingdom is interested in importing inexpensive electricity from renewable sources of energy, and this could lead to further development of the energy resources.\n\nEducation and science\n\nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Culture is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. However, playschools, primary schools, and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities. The government does allow citizens to Home educate their children, however under a very strict set of demands.  Students must adhere closely to the government mandated curriculum, and the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate.\n\nNursery school, or leikskóli, is non-compulsory education for children younger than six years, and is the first step in the education system. The current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 1994. They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into compulsory education as easy as possible.\n\nCompulsory education, or grunnskóli, comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often is conducted at the same institution. Education is mandatory by law for children aged from 6 to 16 years. The school year lasts nine months, beginning between 21 August and 1 September, ending between 31 May and 10 June. The minimum number of school days was once 170, but after a new teachers' wage contract, it increased to 180. Lessons take place five days a week. All public schools have mandatory education in Christianity, although an exemption may be considered by the Minister of Education.\n\nUpper secondary education, or framhaldsskóli, follows lower secondary education. These schools are also known as gymnasia in English. Though not compulsory, everyone who has had a compulsory education has the right to upper secondary education. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 1996. All schools in Iceland are mixed sex schools. The largest seat of higher education is the University of Iceland, which has its main campus in central Reykjavík. Other schools offering university-level instruction include Reykjavík University, University of Akureyri, Agricultural University of Iceland and Bifröst University.\n\nAn OECD assessment found 64% of Icelanders aged 25–64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, which is lower than the OECD average of 73%. Among 25- to 34-year-olds, only 69% have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, significantly lower than the OECD average of 80%. Nevertheless, Iceland's education system is considered to be of excellent quality: the Programme for International Student Assessment currently ranks it as the 16th best performing, above the OECD average.  Students were particularly proficient in reading and mathematics.\n\nAccording to a 2013 Eurostat report by the European Commission, Iceland spends around 3.11% of its GDP on scientific research and development (R&D), over 1 percentage point higher than the EU average of 2.03%, and has set a target of 4% to be reached by 2020.  A 2010 UNESCO report found that out of 72 countries that spend the most on R&D (100 million US dollars or more), Iceland ranked 9th by proportion of GDP, tied with Taiwan, Switzerland, and Germany and ahead of France, the UK, and Canada. \n\nDemographics\n\nThe original population of Iceland was of Nordic and Gaelic origin. This is evident from literary evidence dating from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as blood type and genetic analyses. One such genetics study has indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin while the majority of the women were of Gaelic origin, meaning many settlers of Iceland were indeed Norwegian Viking warriors who brought Gaelic slaves with them. \n\nIceland has extensive genealogical records dating back to the late 17th century and fragmentary records extending back to the Age of Settlement. The biopharmaceutical company deCODE genetics has funded the creation of a genealogy database which attempts to cover all of Iceland's known inhabitants. It views the database, called Íslendingabók, as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases, given the relative isolation of Iceland's population.\n\nThe population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000 to 60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times. There were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804.  The first census was carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50,358. After the destructive volcanic eruptions of the Laki volcano during 1783–1784, the population reached a low of about 40,000.  Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th century—from about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008. Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with one out of five people being 14 years old or younger. With a fertility rate of 2.1, Iceland is one of only a few European countries with a birth rate sufficient for long-term population growth (see table on the left).  \n\nIn December 2007, 33,678 people (13.5% of the total population) living in Iceland had been born abroad, including children of Icelandic parents living abroad. Around 19,000 people (6% of the population) held foreign citizenship. Polish people make up the largest minority group by a considerable margin, and still form the bulk of the foreign workforce. About 8,000 Poles now live in Iceland, 1,500 of them in Fjarðabyggð where they make up 75% of the workforce who are constructing the Fjarðarál aluminium plant.  The recent increase in immigration has been credited to a labour shortage due to the booming economy at the time, as well as to the lifting of restrictions on the movement of people from the countries that were a part of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union. Large-scale construction projects in the east of Iceland (see Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant) have also brought in many people whose stay is expected to be temporary. Many Polish immigrants were also considering leaving in 2008 as a result of the Icelandic financial crisis. \n\nThe southwest corner of Iceland is the most densely populated region. It is also the location of the capital Reykjavík, the northernmost national capital in the world. The largest towns outside the Greater Reykjavík area are Akureyri and Reykjanesbær, although the latter is relatively close to the capital.\n\nSome 500 Icelanders under the leadership of Erik the Red colonised Greenland among the existing paleo-Eskimo inhabitants in the late 10th century.  The total population reached a high point of perhaps 5,000 and developed independent institutions before disappearing by 1500.  People from Greenland attempted to set up a colony at Vinland in North America, but it was abandoned in the face of hostility from the indigenous residents.  Emigration to the United States and Canada began in the 1870s. , Canada had over 88,000 people of Icelandic descent,  while there are more than 40,000 Americans of Icelandic descent, according to the 2000 US census. \n\nUrbanisation\n\nIceland's 10 most populous urban areas:\n\nLanguage\n\nIceland's official written and spoken language is Icelandic, a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse. In grammar and vocabulary, it has changed less from Old Norse than the other Nordic languages; Icelandic has preserved more verb and noun inflection, and has to a considerable extent developed new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from other languages. The puristic tendency in the development of Icelandic vocabulary is to a large degree a result of conscious language planning, in addition to centuries of isolation. Icelandic is the only living language to retain the use of the runic letter Þ in Latin script. The closest living relative of the Icelandic language is Faroese.\n\nIcelandic Sign Language was officially recognised as a minority language in 2011. In education, its use for Iceland's deaf community is regulated by the National Curriculum Guide.\n\nEnglish and Danish are compulsory subjects in the school curriculum. Both languages are widely understood and spoken.  Other commonly spoken languages are Swedish, Norwegian, German and French. Polish is mostly spoken by the local Polish community (the biggest minority of Iceland), and Danish is mostly spoken in a way largely comprehensible to Swedes and Norwegians—it is often referred to as skandinavíska (i. e. Scandinavian) in Iceland. \n\nRather than using family names, as is the usual custom in most western nations, Icelanders carry patronymic or matronymic surnames, patronyms being far more commonly practiced. Patronymic last names are based on the first name of the father, while matronymic names are based on the first name of the mother. These follow the person's given name, e.g. Elísabet Jónsdóttir (\"Elísabet, Jón's daughter\" (Jón, being the father)) or Ólafur Katrínarson (\"Ólafur, Katrín's son\" (Katrín being the mother)).  Consequently, Icelanders refer to one another by their given name, and the Icelandic telephone directory is listed alphabetically by first name rather than by surname.  All new names must be decided upon by the Icelandic Naming Committee.\n\nHealth\n\nIceland has a universal health care system that is administered by its Ministry of Welfare ()  and paid for mostly by taxes (85%) and to a lesser extent by service fees (15%). Unlike most countries, there are no private hospitals, and private insurance is practically nonexistent.\n\nA considerable portion of the government budget is assigned to health care, and Iceland ranks 11th in health care expenditures as a percentage of GDP  and 14th in spending per capita.  Over all, the country’s health care system is one of the best performing in the world, ranked 15th by the World Health Organization.  According to an OECD report, Iceland devotes far more resources to healthcare than most industrialised nations. , Iceland had 3.7 doctors per 1,000 people (compared with an average of 3.1 in OECD countries) and 15.3 nurses per 1,000 people (compared with an OECD average of 8.4).[http://www.webcitation.org/67HObnj6m OECD Health Data 2011]. oecd.org\n\nIcelanders are among the world’s healthiest people, with 81% reporting to be in good health, according to an OECD survey. Although it is a growing problem, obesity is not as prevalent as in other developed countries, infant mortality is one of the lowest in the world,  and the proportion of the population that smokes is lower than the OECD average. The average life expectancy is 81.8 (compared to an OECD average of 79.5), the 4th highest in the world. \n\nAdditionally, Iceland has a very low level of pollution, thanks to an overwhelming reliance on cleaner geothermal energy, a low population density, and a high level of environmental consciousness among citizens.  According to an OECD assessment, the amount of toxic material in the atmosphere is far lower than any other industrialised country measured. \n\nReligion\n\nIcelanders have freedom of religion under the Constitution of Iceland, though the Church of Iceland, a Lutheran body, is the state church. The Registers Iceland keeps account of the religious affiliation of every Icelandic citizen. In 2015, Icelanders were divided into religious groups as follows:\n*73.8% members of the Church of Iceland.\n*11.7% members of some other Christian denomination.\n*7.1% other and not specified\n*5.6% unaffiliated\n*1.5% members of non-Christian denomination.\n*0.3% members of the Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association\n\nIceland is a very secular country: as with other Nordic nations, religious attendance is relatively low.  The above statistics represent administrative membership of religious organisations, which does not necessarily reflect the belief demographics of the population of Iceland. According to a study published in 2001, 23% of the inhabitants were either atheist or agnostic.  A Gallup poll conducted in 2012 found that 57% of Icelanders considered themselves \"a religious person\", 31% considered themselves \"a non religious person\", while 10% defined themselves as \"a convinced atheist\", placing Iceland among the ten countries with the highest proportions of atheists in the world.\n\nCulture\n\nIcelandic culture has its roots in North Germanic traditions. Icelandic literature is popular, in particular the sagas and eddas that were written during the High and Late Middle Ages. Centuries of isolation have helped to insulate the country's Nordic culture from external influence; a prominent example is the preservation of the Icelandic language, which remains the closest to Old Norse of all modern Scandinavian languages.\n\nIn contrast to other Nordic countries, Icelanders place relatively great importance on independence and self-sufficiency; in a public opinion analysis conducted by the European Commission, over 85% of Icelanders found independence to be \"very important,\" compared to 47% of Norwegians, 49% of Danes, and an average of 53% for the EU25. Icelanders also have a very strong work ethic, working some of the longest hours of any industrialised nation. \n\nAccording to a poll conducted by the OECD, 66% of Icelanders were satisfied with their lives, while 70% believed that their lives will be satisfying in the future. Similarly, 83% of people in Iceland reported having more positive experiences in an average day than negative ones, compared to an OECD average of 72%, which makes Iceland one of the happiest countries in the OECD. A more recent 2012 survey found that around three quarters of respondents stated they were satisfied with their lives, compared to a global average of about 53%. \n\nIceland is liberal with regard to LGBT rights issues. In 1996, the Icelandic parliament passed legislation to create registered partnerships for same-sex couples, conferring nearly all the rights and benefits of marriage. In 2006, parliament voted unanimously to grant same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples in adoption, parenting and assisted insemination treatment. On 11 June 2010, the Icelandic parliament amended the marriage law, making it gender neutral and defining marriage as between two individuals, making Iceland one of the first countries in the world to legalise same-sex marriage. The law took effect on 27 June 2010. The amendment to the law also means registered partnerships for same-sex couples are now no longer possible, and marriage is their only option—identical to the existing situation for opposite-sex couples.\n\nIcelanders are known for their deep sense of community: an OECD survey found that 98% believe they know someone they could rely on in a time of need, higher than in any other industrialised country. Similarly, only 6% reported \"rarely\" or \"never\" socializing with others. This high level of social cohesion is attributed to the small size and homogeneity of the population, as well as to a long history of harsh survival in an isolated environment, which reinforced the importance of unity and cooperation. \n\nEgalitarianism is highly valued among the people of Iceland, with income inequality being among the lowest in the world. The constitution explicitly prohibits the enactment of noble privileges, titles, and ranks.Wilcox and Latif, pp. 60–61. Everyone is addressed by their first name. As in other Nordic countries, equality between the sexes is very high; Iceland is consistently ranked among the top three countries in the world for women to live in.   \n\nLiterature\n\nIceland's best-known classical works of literature are the Icelanders' sagas, prose epics set in Iceland's age of settlement. The most famous of these include Njáls saga, about an epic blood feud, and Grænlendinga saga and Eiríks saga, describing the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland (modern Newfoundland). Egils saga, Laxdæla saga, Grettis saga, Gísla saga and Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu are also notable and popular Icelanders' sagas.\n\nA translation of the Bible was published in the 16th century. Important compositions since the 15th to the 19th century include sacred verse, most famously the Passion Hymns of Hallgrímur Pétursson, and rímur, rhyming epic poems. Originating in the 14th century, rímur were popular into the 19th century, when the development of new literary forms was provoked by the influential, National-Romantic writer Jónas Hallgrímsson. In recent times, Iceland has produced many great writers, the best-known of whom is arguably Halldór Laxness, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955 (the only Icelander to win a Nobel Prize thus far). Steinn Steinarr was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular.\n\nIcelanders are avid consumers of literature, with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world. For its size, Iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation. Iceland also has the highest per capita publication of books and magazines,  and around 10% of the population will publish a book in their lifetimes. \n\nArt\n\nThe distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement for home rule and independence, which was very active in the mid-19th century.\n\nContemporary Icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of Þórarinn Þorláksson, who, following formal training in art in the 1890s in Copenhagen, returned to Iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924, almost exclusively portraying the Icelandic landscape. Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at that time, including Ásgrímur Jónsson, who together with Þórarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Iceland's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of Þórarinn and Ásgrímur. These included Jóhannes Kjarval and Júlíana Sveinsdóttir. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic volcanic rock that dominates the Icelandic environment. Einar Hákonarson is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting. In the 1980s, many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work.\n\nIn the recent years artistic practice has multiplied, and the Icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions. The artist run gallery space Kling og Bang, members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue Klink og Bank, has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces, exhibitions and projects.  The Living Art Museum, Reykjavík Municipal Art Museum, Reykjavík Art Museum and the National Gallery of Iceland are the larger, more established institutions, curating shows and festivals.\n\nThorarinn thingvellir.jpg|Þingvellir by Þórarinn B.

The national anthem of Iceland is Lofsöngur, written by Matthías Jochumsson, with music by Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson. \n\nTraditional Icelandic music is strongly religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgrímur Pétursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magnús Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by harmoniums. Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called rímur. Rímur are epic tales, usually a cappella, which can be traced back to skaldic poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes.  The best known rímur poet of the 19th century was Sigurður Breiðfjörð (1798–1846). A modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of Iðunn.\n\nIcelandic contemporary music consists of a big group of bands, ranging from pop-rock groups such as Bang Gang, Quarashi and Amiina to solo ballad singers like Bubbi Morthens, Megas and Björgvin Halldórsson. Independent music is very strong in Iceland, with bands such as múm, The Sugarcubes, HAM, Of Monsters and Men, Sigur Rós, Sóley and Viking metal band Skálmöld, as well as solo artists Emilíana Torrini and Mugison.\n\nSome Icelandic jazz musicians and jazz bands have earned a reputation outside Iceland. Perhaps best known is the jazz fusion band Mezzoforte and Los Angeles-based jazz vocalist Anna Mjöll. Many Icelandic artists and bands have enjoyed international success, most notably Björk and Sigur Rós but also Quarashi, Hera, Ampop, Mínus and múm. The main music festival is arguably Iceland Airwaves, an annual event on the Icelandic music scene, where Icelandic bands along with foreign ones play in the clubs of Reykjavík for a week. Electronic musicians include ones such as Thor and GusGus.\n\nAmong Iceland's best-known classical composers are Daníel Bjarnason and Anna S. Þorvaldsdóttir (Anna Thorvaldsdottir), who in 2012 received the Nordic Council Music Prize and in 2015 was chosen as the New York Philharmonic's Kravis Emerging Composer, an honor that includes a $50,000 cash prize and a commission to write a composition for the orchestra; she is the second recipient. \n\nMedia\n\nIceland's largest television stations are the state-run Sjónvarpið and the privately owned Stöð 2 and SkjárEinn. Smaller stations exist, many of them local. Radio is broadcast throughout the country, including some parts of the interior. The main radio stations are Rás 1, Rás 2, X-ið 977, Bylgjan and FM957. The daily newspapers are Morgunblaðið and Fréttablaðið. The most popular websites are the news sites Vísir and Mbl.is. \n\nIceland is home to LazyTown (Icelandic: Latibær), a children's television programme created by Magnús Scheving. It has become a very popular programme for children and adults and is shown in over 100 countries, including the UK, the Americas and Sweden.  The LazyTown studios are located in Garðabær. The 2015 television crime series Trapped aired in the UK on BBC4 in February and March 2016, to critical acclaim and according to the Guardian \"the unlikeliest TV hit of the year\". \n\nIn 1992 the Icelandic film industry achieved its greatest recognition hitherto, when Friðrik Þór Friðriksson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for his film, Children of Nature. Actress Guðrún S. Gísladóttir, who is Icelandic, played one of the major roles in Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky's 1986 film, The Sacrifice. Anita Briem, known for her performance in Showtime's The Tudors, is also Icelandic. Briem starred in the 2008 film Journey to the Center of the Earth, which shot scenes in Iceland. The 2002 James Bond movie Die Another Day is set for a large-part in Iceland. Christopher Nolan's 2014 film, Interstellar was also filmed in Iceland for some of its scenes. \n\nOn 17 June 2010, the parliament passed the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, a resolution proposing greater protection of free speech rights and the identity of journalists and whistle-blowers, the strongest journalist protection law in the world.  According to a 2011 report by Freedom House, Iceland is one of the highest ranked countries in press freedom. \n\nCCP Games, developers of the critically acclaimed EVE Online and Dust 514, is headquartered in Reykjavík. CCP Games hosts the third most populated MMO in the world, which also has the largest total game area for an online game.\n\nIceland has a highly developed internet culture, with around 95% of the population having internet access, the highest proportion in the world.  Iceland ranked 12th in the World Economic Forum's 2009–2010 Network Readiness Index, which measures a country's ability to competitively exploit communications technology.  The United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks the country 3rd in its development of information and communications technology, having moved up four places between 2008 and 2010.  In February 2013 the country (ministry of the interior) was researching possible methods to protect children in regards to Internet pornography, claiming that pornography online is a threat to children as it supports child slavery and abuse. Strong voices within the community expressed concerns with this, stating that it is impossible to block access to child pornography without compromising the freedom of speech.   \n\nCuisine\n\nMuch of Iceland's cuisine is based on fish, lamb, and dairy products, with little to no utilization of herbs or spices. Due to the island's climate, fruits and vegetables are not generally a component of traditional dishes, although the use of greenhouses has made them more common in contemporary food. Þorramatur is a selection of traditional cuisine consisting of many dishes, and is usually consumed around the month of Þorri, which begins on the first Friday after 19 January. Traditional dishes also include skyr, hákarl (cured shark), cured ram, singed sheep heads, and black pudding. Puffin is considered a local delicacy that is often prepared through broiling.\n\nBreakfast usually consists of pancakes, cereal, fruit, and coffee, while lunch may take the form of a smörgåsbord. The main meal of the day for most Icelanders is dinner, which usually involves fish or lamb as the main course. Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly cod and haddock but also salmon, herring, and halibut. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as hangikjöt) or salt-preserved (saltkjöt). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as slátur, which consists of offal (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach. Additionally, boiled or mashed potatoes, pickled cabbage, green beans, and rye bread are prevalent side dishes.\n\nCoffee is a popular beverage in Iceland, and is drunk at breakfast, after meals, and with a light snack in mid-afternoon. Coca-Cola is also widely consumed, to the extent that the country is said to have one of the highest per capita consumption rates in the world.  Iceland's signature alcoholic beverage is Brennivín (literally \"burnt (i.e. distilled) wine\"), which is similar to Scandinavian akvavit. It is a type of vodka made from distilled potatoes and flavoured with either caraway seeds or angelica. Its potency has earned it the nickname svarti dauði (\"Black Death\").\n\nSport\n\nSport is an important part of Icelandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.  The main traditional sport in Iceland is Glíma, a form of wrestling thought to have originated in medieval times.\n\nPopular sports include association football, track and field, handball and basketball. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,Wilcox and Latif, p. 110 and Iceland's men's national team is ranked among the top 12 in the world. The Icelandic national football team qualified for the UEFA European football championship for the first time in 2016 and advanced to the quarter-final to play against France. They defeated England 2–1 in the round of 16. The Icelandic women's team also excel at football relative to the size of the country, with the national team ranked 15th by FIFA.  In 2014 the Icelandic men's national basketball team qualified into the EuroBasket 2015 for the first time in the country history.\n\nIceland has excellent conditions for skiing, fishing, snowboarding, ice climbing and rock climbing, although mountain climbing and hiking are preferred by the general public. Iceland is also a world-class destination for alpine ski touring and Telemark skiing, with the Troll Peninsula in Northern Iceland being the main centre of activity. Although the country's environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there are nevertheless lots of golf courses throughout the island, and Iceland has a greater percentage of the population playing golf than Scotland with over 17,000 registered golfers out of a population of approximately 300,000.  Iceland hosts an annual international golf tournament known as the Arctic Open played through the night during the summer solstice at Akureyri Golf Club. Wilcox and Latif, p. 111 Iceland has also won the most competitions for World's Strongest Man, with eight titles shared evenly between Magnús Ver Magnússon and Jón Páll Sigmarsson.\n\nSwimming is popular in Iceland. Geothermally heated outdoor pools are widespread, and swimming courses are a mandatory part of the national curriculum. Horseback riding, which was historically the most prevalent form of transportation on the island, remains a common pursuit for many Icelanders.\n\nThe oldest sport association in Iceland is the Reykjavík Shooting Association, founded in 1867. Rifle shooting became very popular in the 19th century with the encouragement of politicians and nationalists who were pushing for Icelandic independence. To this day, it remains a significant pastime. \n\nIceland has also produced many chess masters and hosted the historic World Chess Championship 1972 in Reykjavík during the height of the Cold War. , there have been nine Icelandic chess grandmasters, a considerable number given the small size of the population.  Bridge is also popular, with Iceland participating in a number of international tournaments. Iceland won the world bridge championship (the Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan, in 1991 and took second place (with Sweden) in Hamilton, Bermuda, in 1950."

                "Regency History: The rise and fall of Beau Brummell (1778-1840)\nThe rise and fall of Beau Brummell (1778-1840)\nby\nfrom The History of White's\n by Hon Algernon Bourke (1892)\nProfile\nGeorge \"Beau\" Brummell (7 June 1778 - 30 March 1840) was a Regency dandy and fashion leader, famous for his elegant dress, his witty remarks and his friendship with George, Prince of Wales, the future George IV.\nFrom Downing Street to Eton\nGeorge Bryan Brummell, famously nicknamed “Beau”, was born on 7 June 1778, the younger son of Billy Brummell and Mary Richardson. He was born in Downing Street, where his father worked as private secretary to Lord North. In 1783, Billy Brummell retired from politics and bought an estate, Donnington Grove in Berkshire.\nIn 1786, Brummell was sent to Eton with his elder brother, William. They were Oppidans or fee-paying boys and boarded with Dame Young. Brummell mingled with the aristocracy, becoming known for his gentlemanly manners and ready wit, which kept him out of trouble. He developed an interest in dress and his elegant bearing earned him the nickname Buck Brummell.\nA grand inheritance\nWhen Brummell’s father died in 1794, he left his estate to be shared equally between his three children, rather than the whole going to his eldest son. The estate, valued at around £60,000, was to be held in trust until the children came of age. This was a huge fortune, equivalent to more than £5 million today using the retail price index, and more like £70 million when relative earnings are taken into account.(1)\nThe Hussars\nBrummell went up to Oriel College, Oxford, in May 1794, but after just one term, he asked his father’s executors for a commission in the army. He became a cornet in the 10th Light Dragoons – the Prince of Wales ’ own regiment. The dragoons wore elaborate uniforms and liked to be known as Hussars. They were disorderly, hard drinking and known for their lack of morality, and included many of the Prince of Wales’ set, of which Brummell soon became an important member.\nBrummell obtained promotion to lieutenant in 1795 and then captain in 1796, and with each promotion came a new, and grander, uniform. But life in the army had its costs. A fall, or possibly a kick, from his horse broke his nose, damaging his classic profile.\nBrummell and the Prince\nfrom Memoirs of George IV\nby Robert Huish (1830)\nIt seems incredible that a non-aristocratic boy of sixteen should be accepted into the Prince’s own regiment and then into his circle of intimate friends. How Brummell first came to the Prince’s notice is not known, but it seems likely that it was his wit and dress sense that attracted the Prince, probably while Brummell was still at Eton.\nBrummell supported the Prince at his wedding to Princess Caroline in 1795; he was also one of the drunken companions whom she accused of ruining her honeymoon.\nWhen the regiment were ordered to Manchester in 1798, Brummell sold out, anxious not to lose his position of influence with the Prince. The following year, he came into his inheritance. He was now a man of means and meant to make his mark.\nBeau Brummell the dandy\nBrummell moved into 4 Chesterfield Street in 1799 and determined to become the best dressed gentleman in London. His levées became events of great importance as gentlemen, including the Prince of Wales, came to see how he dressed. It was around 1800, after Brummell’s first season in London, that he acquired the nickname Beau.\nHis style was understated elegance, with a limited palette of colours, rather than the gaudy finery of the Georgian gentleman. He was famous for the intricate folds of his neck cloth and the Bath coating material of his blue jacket. He patronized a variety of tailors so that no one could say that they made him famous.\nBrummell rules the ton\nFor many years, it was Brummell’s opinion that mattered. It was he who influenced who should be given vouchers for Almack’s . He could bring someone into fashion by showing them favour or put someone out of fashion by cutting them.\nHe was a member of Whites, Brooks and Watiers. A bow window in his club at White’s became known as the Beau window because that was where Brummell liked to sit. He was the perpetual president of Watiers which was established to provide better suppers to the gentlemen who ate in their clubs.\nThe bow window at White's\nfrom The History of White's\n by Hon Algernon Bourke (1892)\nBrummell’s lady friends\nThough he flirted prolifically, Brummell’s affections were rarely engaged. Brummel’s first love was reputedly Julia Storer, later Julia Johnstone, who became a famous courtesan. \nHe was particular friends with Lady Hester Stanhope, the eccentric bluestocking; Lady Elizabeth Howard, Duchess of Rutland, until his rudeness alienated her; and the Duchess of Devonshire who wrote poems for his collection.\nBut his closest lady friend was Frederica, Duchess of York. He loved her unstructured house parties at Oatlands and shared her love of animals. He gave her a dog, Fidélité; she sent him gifts in exile, including a comfy chair. One of the few items in Brummell’s possession at his death was a miniature of Princess Frederica’s left eye. This suggests a level of intimacy that can only be guessed at. Brummell claimed it was out of respect for promises to the Princess that he refused to publish his memoirs even when he was desperate for money.\nFrederica, Duchess of York\nfrom A Biographical Memoir of Frederick,\n Duke of York and Albany\nby John Watkins (1827)\nBrummell’s downfall\nBrummell was famous for his wit, but infamous for his rudeness. It was this rudeness which eventually cost him the Prince of Wales’ regard. “Alvanley, who’s your fat friend?”(2) he asked, referring to the Prince.\nBrummell ran up debts through his extravagance, but also through his heavy gambling losses. He was continually borrowing money, but matters came to a head when a man named Richard Meyler discovered that Brummell was going to renege on his debt to him. He sat in White’s and told all who came of Brummell’s infamous conduct. He was, effectively, asking him out. Meyler became known as Dick the Dandy-killer.\nEscape to Calais\nOn 18 May 1816, Brummell fled. He travelled through the night to Dover and on to Calais, which was as far as he could go without a passport. He stayed at Dessin’s Hotel and entertained in his apartments whilst learning French and writing his memoirs.\nBrummell had escaped his debts, but he could not escape the reality that he was ill. He probably acquired the habit of visiting prostitutes whilst in the army, and at some point, late in his time in London, he was infected with syphilis.\nBefore he died in 1830, George IV made Brummell the British consul in Caen. The salary enabled him to start paying off the debts he had already accumulated in Calais. He celebrated his freedom in Paris before taking up his post.\nConsul in Caen\nIn Caen, he lodged with Madame de St Ursain and fell in love with her teenage daughter, Aimable. By now, he was suffering from terrible headaches and depression from the progression of his illness.\nBut his position as consul did not last and when the post was abolished in 1832, his debts became pressing and he had to hide to escape the bailiffs.\nThat summer, Brummell suffered a temporary paralysis. His letters to Aimable were discovered and her furious mother evicted him from his lodgings. When she was sent to England, Brummell gave her his album – poems that he had collected from his friends.\nBrummell as an old man\nfrom The History of White's\n by Hon Algernon Bourke (1892)\nDecline and death\nOn 4 May 1835, Brummell was arrested for the money he owed to Leleux, the owner of Dessin’s Hotel in Calais. George Armstrong, a Caen grocer, agreed to travel to England to seek pecuniary help on Brummell’s behalf. Brummell was awarded compensation for the loss of the consulship and was duly released from prison on 21 July 1835.\nBrummell struggled on as the syphilis took its course. He was increasingly in pain, delusional, depressed and subject to seizures and eventually insanity. In January 1839, he was transferred to an asylum where he died on 30 March 1840. His death went virtually unnoticed in England where he had ruled as king of the ton for so long.\nRead more about Beau Brummell - 30 quotes and anecdotes.\nNotes",
                "Who's A Dandy? | The New York Public Library\nThe New York Public Library\nWho's A Dandy? by Paula BaxterMarch 19, 2009\nShare\nShare\nPreview this post in our new blog design\n Men’s clothing would never be what it is today without George “Beau” Brummell (1778-1840). This ingenious man, the father of the modern dandy, was initially a court favorite who fell from grace. He was a walking advertisement for the modish man. Although he took only one dip into literature , his reformation of masculine style was transformative. \nOne of the things I find most interesting, however, is how few portraits exist of him. The  one or two of those that have come down to us are actually suspect likenesses. And this in an age when English printmakers were at their most vicious and satirical…  That Brummell’s influence endured throughout the nineteenth century is the subject of an essay by a Frenchman, Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly. The Anatomy of dandyism kept the Brummell legend alive. The author’s study of masculine dress taste would prove influential indeed."
